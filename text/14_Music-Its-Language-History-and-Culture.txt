INTRODUCTION

Welcome to Music 1300, Music: Its Language History, and Culture. The course has a number
of interrelated objectives:
1. To introduce you to works representative of a variety of music traditions.
These include the repertoires of Western Europe from the Middle Ages
through the present; of the United States, including art music, jazz, folk,
rock, musical theater; and from at least two non-Western world areas (Africa,
Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Indian subcontinent).
2. To enable you to speak and write about the features of the music you study,
employing vocabulary and concepts of melody, rhythm, harmony, texture, timbre,
and form used by musicians.
3. To explore with you the historic, social, and cultural contexts and the role
of class, ethnicity, and gender in the creation and performance of music,
including practices of improvisation and the implications of oral and
notated transmission.
4. To acquaint you with the sources of musical sounds—instruments and voices from
different cultures, found sounds, electronically generated sounds; basic principles
that determine pitch and timbre.
5. To examine the influence of technology, mass media, globalization, and transnational
currents on the music of today.
The chapters in this reader contain definitions and explanations of musical terms and concepts,
short essays on subjects related to music as a creative performing art, biographical sketches
of major figures in music, and historical and cultural background information on music from
different periods and places.

CHAPTER 1: ELEMENTS OF SOUND AND MUSIC

Making music has been an activity of human beings, both as individuals and with others,
for thousands of years. Written texts, pictorial representations, and folklore sources provide
evidence that people from all over the globe and from the beginnings of recorded history
have created and performed music for religious rituals, civil ceremonies, social functions,
story telling, and self-expression. Some of the terminology, concepts, and vocabulary used
by musicians in writing and talking about the many types of music you will be studying are
discussed in this section on elements of sound and music.
Elements of Sound
From the perspective of a musician, anything that is capable of producing sound is a potential
instrument for musical exploitation. What we perceive as sound are vibrations (sound waves)
traveling through a medium (usually air) that are captured by the ear and converted into
electrochemical signals that are sent to the brain to be processed.
Since sound is a wave, it has all of the properties attributed to any wave, and these
attributes are the four elements that define any and all sounds. They are the frequency,
amplitude, wave form and duration, or in musical terms, pitch, dynamic, timbre (tone color),
and duration.

Frequency
The frequency, or pitch, is the element of sound that we are best able to hear. We are mesmerized
when a singer reaches a particularly high note at the climax of a song, just as we are when a
dancer makes a spectacularly difficult leap. We feel very low notes (low pitches) in a physical
way as well, sometimes expressing dark or somber sentiments as in music by country singers
like Johnny Cash, and other times as the rhythmic propulsion of low-frequency pulsations in
electronically amplified dance music.
The ability to distinguish pitch varies from person to person, just as different people
are better and less capable at distinguishing different colors (light frequency). Those who are
especially gifted recognizing specific pitches are said to have “perfect pitch.” On the other hand,
just as there are those who have difficulty seeing the difference in colors that are near each other

ELEMENTS OF SOUND AND MUSIC
in the light spectrum (color-blind), there are people who have trouble identifying pitches that
are close to each other. If you consider yourself to be such a “tone-deaf” person, do not fret.
The great American composer Charles Ives considered the singing of the tone-deaf caretaker
at his church to be some of the most genuine and expressive music he experienced.
An audio compact disc is able to record sound waves that vibrate as slow as 20 times per
second (20 Hertz = 20 Hz) and as fast as 20,000 times per second (20,000 Hertz = 20 kiloHertz =
20 kHz). Humans are able to perceive sounds from approximately 20 Hz to 15 kHz, depending
on age, gender, and noise in the environment. Many animals are able to perceive sounds
much higher in pitch.
When musicians talk about being “in tune” and “out of tune,” they are talking about
pitch, but more specifically, about the relationship of one pitch to another. In music we often
have a succession of pitches, which we call a melody, and also play two or more pitches at
the same time, which we call harmony. In both cases, we are conscious of the mathematical
distance between the pitches as they follow each other horizontally (melody) and vertically
(harmony). The simpler the mathematical relationship between the two pitches, the more
consonant it sounds and the easier it is to hear if the notes are in tune.
The simplest relationship of one pitch to another is called the octave. The octave is
so fundamental that we give two pitches an octave apart the same letter name. The ratio
between notes an octave apart is 2:1. If we have a note vibrating at 400 Hz, the pitch an
octave higher vibrates at 800 Hz (2 * 400 Hz). The pitch an octave lower than 400 Hz has a
frequency of 200 Hz (400 Hz / 2).

Example 1.1 Two sound waves one octave apart.
The bottom is 1/400th of a second of a sine wave
vibrating at 400 Hz.

Example 1.2 Two sound waves with the same
frequency, the top is 10 db softer than the
bottom.

Amplitude
Amplitude is the amount of energy contained in the sound wave and is perceived as being
either loud or soft. Amplitude is measured in decibels, but our perception of loud and soft
changes depending on the sounds around us. Walking down a busy street at noon where the
noise in the environment might average 50 decibels, we would find it difficult to hear the voice
of a person next to us speaking at 40 decibels. On that same street at night that 40 decibel
speaking voice will seem like a shout when the surrounding noise is only about 30 decibels.
Wave Form
The wave form of a sound determines the tone color, or timbre that we hear and is how we can
tell the difference between the sound produced by a voice, a guitar, and a saxophone even if
they are playing the same frequency at the same amplitude.
The simplest wave form is the sine wave, which we have seen diagrammed in the
examples for frequency and amplitude above. Pure sine waves rarely occur in nature but
they can easily be created through electronic means. An instrument with a timbre close to

ELEMENTS OF SOUND AND MUSIC
the purity of a sine wave is the flute. The violin section of the orchestra, by contrast, has a
much more complex timbre as seen in its wave form below.

Example 1.3 Wave form of a solo flute.

Example 1.4 Wave form of a violin string section.

Duration
Every sound event has its unique duration, which we perceive as being either short or long,
depending on the context. Several durations, one after another, create the rhythm of a piece.
Elements of Music
Rhythm
All music involves the unfolding of sounds in time. Some of the terminology used in describing
music therefore refers to the durational and temporal organization of musical sounds. The
attack points of a sequence of sounds produce rhythm. The three syllables of the word
“strawberry” can be pronounced at evenly spaced intervals (straw-ber-ry), or the first syllable
can be stretched out, producing one long and two shorter durations (straaaaw-ber-ry)—two
different speech rhythms. The speech rhythm of “My country, ‘tis of thee” moves in evenly
spaced syllables up to “tis,” which is elongated, followed by “of,” which is cut short and
leads directly to “thee”—ta ta ta taaa t-ta. In both vocal and instrumental music, rhythm is
generated by the onset of new sounds, whether the progression from one word or syllable to
the next in a song, the succession of pitches of a violin melody, the striking of a drum, or the
strumming of chords on a guitar.
Meter
The succession of attacks and durations that produces rhythm may proceed in a quite
unpredictable flow (“to be or not to be, that is the question”—the opening of Hamlet’s
soliloquy)—what is called nonmetered or free rhythm—or may occur so as to create an
underlying pulse or beat (“bubble, bubble, toil and trouble”—four beats coinciding with
buh–buh–toil–truh—from the witches’ incantation in Macbeth ). Recurrent groupings of beats
by two’s, three’s, or some combination of two’s and three’s, produces meter. The first beat of
each metric group is often described as accented to characterize its defining function in the
rhythmic flow (My country ‘tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing—six groups of three
beats, each beginning with the underlined syllable).
Another important rhythmic phenomenon is syncopation, which signifies irregular or
unexpected stresses in the rhythmic flow (for example, straw-ber-ry instead of straw-ber-ry). A
distinctive sequence of longs and shorts that recurs throughout an individual work or groups
of works, such as particular dance types, is called a rhythmic pattern, rhythmic figure, or
rhythmic motive.
Pitch
Pitch refers to the location of a musical sound in terms of low or high. As we have seen, in
terms of the physics of sound, pitch is determined by frequency, or the number of vibrations
per second: the faster a sounding object vibrates, the higher its pitch.
Although the audible range of frequencies for human beings is from about 20 to
under 20,000 vibrations per second, the upper range of musical pitches is only around 4,000

5

6

ELEMENTS OF SOUND AND MUSIC
vibrations per second. Frequency is determined by the length and thickness of the vibrating
object. In general, longer and thicker objects vibrate more slowly and produce lower pitches
than shorter and thinner ones. Thus, men’s voices are usually lower than those of women
and children, who have comparatively shorter and thinner vocal cords. The same principle
is visible in the construction of many instruments. The longest wooden bars of a xylophone
produce the lowest pitches, the shortest produce the highest. The alto saxophone is smaller
and has a higher range than the slightly larger tenor saxophone.
Pitch, like temperature, is a sliding scale of infinite gradations. All theoretical systems
of music organize this pitch continuum into successions of discrete steps analogous to the
degrees on a thermometer. And just as the Fahrenheit and Celsius systems use different sized
increments to measure temperature, different musical cultures have evolved distinctive pitch
systems. The conventional approach to classifying pitch material is to construct a scale, an
arrangement of the pitch material of a piece of music in order from low to high (and sometimes
from high to low as well). Each element of a scale is called a “step” and the distance between
steps is called an interval. Most Western European music is based on diatonic scales—seventone scales comprised of five “whole steps” (moderate-size intervals) and two “half steps”
(small intervals). The position of the whole and half steps in the ascending ladder of tones
determines the mode of the scale. Major and minor are two commonly encountered modes,
but others are used in folk music, in Western European music before 1700, and in jazz. Another
important scale type particularly associated with music from China, Japan, Korea, and other
Asian cultures is pentatonic, a five-note scale comprised of three whole steps and two intervals
of a step and a half.
The starting pitch of a scale is called the tonic or keynote. Most melodies end on the
tonic of their scale, which functions as a point of rest, the pitch to which the others ultimately
gravitate in the unfolding of a melody. Key is the combination of tonic and scale type.
Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony is in C minor because its basic musical materials are drawn from
the minor scale that starts on the pitch C.
Melody
A succession of musical tones perceived as constituting a meaningful whole is called a
melody. By its very nature, melody cannot be separated from rhythm. A musical tone has
two fundamental qualities, pitch and duration, and both of these enter into the succession of
pitch plus duration that constitutes a melody.
Melody can be synonymous with tune, but the melodic dimension of music also
encompasses configurations of tones that may not be singable or particularly tuneful.
Conversely, music may employ pitch material but not have a melody, as is the case with some
percussion music. Attributes of melody include its compass, that is, whether it spans a wide
or narrow range of pitches, and whether its movement is predominantly conjunct (moving
by step and therefore smooth in contour) or disjunct (leaping to non-adjunct tones and
therefore jagged in contour). Melodies may occur without additional parts (monophony), in
combination with other melodies (polyphony), or supported by harmonies (homophony)—see
the following discussion about Texture.
Melodies may be designed like sentences, falling into clauses, or phrases. Indeed, in
composing vocal music, composers generally design melodies to parallel the structure and
syntax of the text they are setting. The termination of a musical phrase is called a cadence.
A full cadence functions like a period, punctuating the end of a complete musical thought. A
half cadence is analogous to a comma, marking a pause or intermediate point of rest within a
phrase. The refrain of Jingle Bells, for example, contains four phrases with three half cadences
and a concluding full cadence:

ELEMENTS OF SOUND AND MUSIC
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way (half cadence)
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh (half cadence)
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way (half cadence)
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh (full cadence, melody descends to the tonic)
In another melodic style, associated more with instrumental than vocal music, melodic material
is not organized in regular, balanced units, but spins out in a long, continuous line.
Texture
Like fabric, music has a texture, which may be dense or transparent, thick or thin, heavy or
light. Musical texture also refers to how many different layers of sound are heard at once, to
whether these layers have a primarily melodic or an accompaniment function, and to how
the layers relate to each other. A texture of a single, unaccompanied melodic line is called
monophony from the Greek “monos” (single, alone) and “phone” (sound). Monophony becomes
heterophony when spontaneous variations of two or more performers produce different
versions of the same melody at the same time. The simultaneous combination of two or more
independent melodies is classified as polyphony and of two or more simultaneous rhythmic
lines as polyrhythm. Another principal textural category is homophony, one dominant melody
with accompaniment. These classifications are often useful in describing individual works and
repertory groups, but in practice many works and styles do not fall neatly into one category.
For example, a common texture in jazz entails some instruments whose interaction would be
described as polyphonic and others whose function it is to accompany them.
Two important concepts in the analysis and description of musical textures are
counterpoint and harmony. Counterpoint refers to the conduct of simultaneously sounding
melodic lines, one against the other. Rhythmic counterpoint denotes the unfolding of
concurrent rhythmic parts in polyrhythmic textures. While counterpoint focuses on linear
events, harmony is concerned with the vertical combination of tones that produces chords
and successions of chords.
The Western system of musical notation, while somewhat limited in the expression
of subtleties of rhythm and pitch, can indicate many simultaneous sounds and has enabled
Western composers to create music of greater textural complexity than that of any other
musical tradition. Principles or rules of composing multipart, or contrapuntal, music were
first formulated during the Middle Ages and have evolved and changed to reflect new musical
aesthetics, performance practices, and compositional techniques.
Tone Color
Tone color, or timbre, is the distinctive quality of a voice or instrument. Tone color is the result
of an acoustic phenomenon known as overtones. In addition to the fundamental frequency
heard as a sound’s pitch, musical tones contain patterns of higher frequencies. Though
these higher frequencies, or overtones, are not usually perceived as pitches in themselves,
their relative presence or absence determines the characteristic quality of a particular voice
or instrument. The prominence of overtones in musical instruments depends on such factors
as the materials from which they are made, their design, and how their sound is produced.
Similarly, the individual physiology of each person’s vocal cords produces a unique speaking
and singing voice. The term tone color suggests an analogy with the visual arts, and indeed
the exploration, manipulation, and combination of instrumental and vocal sound qualities
by performers and composers may be compared to the use of color by painters. Terms such
as orchestration, scoring, and arranging refer to the aspect of composition that involves the
purposeful treatment of tone color. A composer may choose to use pure colors (for example,
the melody played by violins) or mixed colors (the melody played by violins and flutes), or
to exploit a particular quality of an instrument, such as the unique sound of the clarinet in
its low range. The art of orchestration encompasses various performance techniques that
affect tone color, among them the use of mutes, which are devices for altering the sound of an
instrument. In violins and other bowed strings, the mute is a small comb-shaped device that
is clamped on the strings, making the sound veiled and somewhat nasal. Brass instruments

ELEMENTS OF SOUND AND MUSIC
are muted by inserting various materials into the bell.
Although tone color has a scientific explanation, its function in music is aesthetic.
Music is an art of sound, and the quality of that sound has much to do with our response to
it. Indeed, the concept of tonal beauty varies considerably in different periods, styles, and
cultures. On the other hand, within a particular context, ideals of beauty may be quite firmly
established and performers often pay extraordinary prices for instruments that can produce
that ideal sound. But no instrument automatically produces a beautiful tone, so the finest
violin will produce a rasping, scraping sound in the hands of a beginner. Even at the most
advanced stages of accomplishment, achieving what is considered to be a beautiful tone is a
criterion of a good performance.
The attitude toward tone color has played an interesting role in the history of Western
art music. Prior to the 18th century, composers were often quite vague, even indifferent, with
respect to how their musical ideas would be realized. It was customary to play music on
whatever instruments were at hand and to perform some or all parts of vocal compositions
on instruments. During the 18th century, as composers became more sensitive to the idiomatic
quality of instruments, they began to conceive musical ideas in terms of particular tone colors.
In the 19th and 20th centuries, the fascination with expanding and experimenting with the
palette of tone colors has elevated the art of orchestration to a level equal to other aspects of
the compositional process.
Form
The interaction of such elements as melody, rhythm, texture, and harmony in the unfolding
of a musical work produces form. Most music conforms to one of the following three basic
formal prototypes:
1. sectional, falling into units of contrasting or repeating content,
2. continuous, usually involving the development and transformation of one or more
germinal ideas,
3. a combination of sectional and continuous.
In addition, four general concepts help in the appreciation of many forms: repetition,
contrast, return, and variation. The concept of “return” is especially important, for when listeners
hear something familiar (that is, something they heard earlier in a work or performance) the
sense of “going home” can be very powerful, whether it takes place in a 45-minute symphony or
a four-minute pop song. One traditional method of representing these concepts is to use letters
of the alphabet to identify individual phrases or sections, AA indicating repetition, AB contrast,
ABCD a continuous structure, ABA return, and ABACA a design involving contrast, repetition
and return. Capital and lower case letters may be used to distinguish between different levels
of formal organization, while symbols for prime (A’, B’ etc) signify restatement of material with
some changes. When a section is repeated more than once with different changes, additional
prime symbols may be used (ABA’CA’’, for example, where the second and third A’s are both
versions of the original “A,” but different from each other).
To illustrate, the chorus of Jingle bells would be represented as abab’ (a for the repeated
music of the first and third lines, b and b’ for the contrasting music of the second and fourth
phrases with their different endings -half and full cadences, respectively). The entire song is
in ABA form (A for Jingle bells….open sleigh), B for the second section of the song (Dashing
through the snow…) and A for the return of the chorus.
In variation form, a melody or chord progression is presented successively in different
versions; the form could be diagrammed as A A’ A’’ A’’’ and so forth. Changes may be made
in key, instrumentation, rhythm, or any number of ways, but the original tune is always
recognizable. Aaron Copland’s variations on the Shaker tune Simple Gifts in his Appalachian
Spring is a famous example of variation on a tune, while Pachelbel’s Canon in D might
be considered a series of variations on a chord progression. Some have compared a jazz
performance to a kind of variation form, where musicians play a pre-existing tune and then
provide a series of improvised “variations” on that tune.

CHAPTER 2: MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS AND ENSEMBLES

Instruments: A World View
Though one could say that the human voice was the first instrument, most cultures have
developed other distinctive ways of creating musical sound, from something as simple as two
sticks struck together to the most complex pipe organ or synthesizer. Learning about musical
instruments can teach you much about a culture’s history and aesthetics, and there are a few
general questions that are useful to ask, especially if an instrument is unfamiliar.
·

What material is it made of? The physical composition of an instrument will often
reflect the area in which it was developed; for example, certain types of wood or
ceramics could indicate a specific geographical region. In addition, the instrument
may be made of materials considered sacred by its culture, or be decorated in such
a way that reflects its significance to the people who play it.

·

How is sound produced? As seen below, there are a variety of ways in which an
instrument can create sound.

·

How is the instrument viewed by the culture that created it? Although in some
cultures instruments are simply viewed as objects used in a musical performance, in
others instruments are viewed as sacred or as part of a distinctive cultural ritual.

·

Performance technique. As varied as are the shapes, sizes, and materials of musical
instruments throughout the world is the manner in which they are played, whether
struck, blown, bowed, shaken, etc. Often one instrument can be played in a variety
of ways: For example, a violin can be bowed, plucked, struck, or even strummed
like a guitar.

·

Tone color/timbre. Related to an instrument’s physical makeup and performance
technique is the quality of its sound: It may be harsh and rough, or smooth and
rich. Often an instrument’s timbre will bring to mind colors or sensations that are
difficult to describe.

·

Range. An instrument’s range has to do with the distance between the lowest note
and the highest note it can produce. As with the human voice, many instruments
have a particular part of the range that is preferred for its pleasing qualities, and

9

MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS AND ENSEMBLES

10

one part of an instrument’s range may sound very different from another (for
example, the low range of the clarinet has an entirely different timbre than the
upper register).
·

How is the instrument used? An instrument may be used alone, or gathered with
other instruments in ensembles.

Ethnomusicologists have devised a series of categories to classify instruments throughout
the world, based on the ways in which they produce sound. Each of these words ends with the
suffix “phone,” the Greek word for sound. The following are just the most general categories;
each can be divided into subcategories, but we won’t be worrying about those in this class.
·

Aerophones: sound produced by air. Aerophones use many mechanisms to make
the air in the instrument vibrate, thus creating sound waves. If you have ever blown
across the top of a soda bottle, you’ve created an aerophone. Blowing across the
bottle’s opening splits the air so some goes across the opening and some goes into
the bottle, thus creating vibrations. If you fill the bottle partially with water, the
sound is higher, because the column of air in the bottle is shorter. In a trumpet,
the vibration of air is created by the buzzing of the lips into a mouthpiece. Many
instruments also use reeds—small, thin pieces of wood or bamboo—that vibrate as
the air passes them, thus creating another distinctive sound.

·

Chordophones: sound produced by strings. Both a rubber band stretched over a
shoe box and a violin could be considered chordophones, as sound is produced
by the vibration of a chord (or string). As mentioned above, chordophones can be
played in a variety of ways: They can be plucked, struck, strummed, or played with
a device known as a bow.

·

Membranophones: sound produced by a stretched membrane (plastic, animal
skin, fiberglass, etc.). The most familiar membranophones are the nearly infinite
varieties of drums found throughout the world.

·

Idiophones: sound produced by the body of the instrument itself. The word
“idiophone” comes from the Greek “id” or “self.” When you clap your hands together,
you are essentially using them as idiophones, as it is the hands themselves that
create the sound. Two sticks knocked together could be considered an idiophone,
as well as any number of types of bells, where the entire instrument is struck and
vibrates. A gourd filled with beads or seeds (or a maraca) would also be considered
an idiophone, because it is the interior material hitting the sides of the instrument
that create the sound.

·

Electrophones: sound produced by electric or electronic means. This is a relatively
new category that includes instruments such as synthesizers, computers, etc.

MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS AND ENSEMBLES

Human Voice as Instrument
The human voice is a natural musical instrument and singing by people of all ages, alone
or in groups, is an activity in all human cultures. The human voice is essentially a wind
instrument, with the lungs supplying the air, the vocal cords setting up the vibrations, and
the cavities of the upper throat, mouth, and nose forming a resonating chamber. Different
pitches are obtained by varying the tension of the opening between the vocal cords.
In the Western tradition, voices are classified according to their place in the pitch
spectrum, soprano, mezzo soprano, and alto being the respective designations for the high,
middle, and low ranges of women’s voices, and tenor, baritone, and bass for men’s. A counter
tenor or contra tenor is a male singer with the range of an alto. These terms are applied not
only to voices and singers but also to the parts they sing.
The range of an individual’s voice is determined by the physiology of the vocal cords.
However, because the vocal cords are muscles, even the most modest singing activity can
increase their flexibility and elasticity, and serious training can do so to a remarkable degree.
Singers also work to extend the power of their voices, control pitch, and quality at all dynamic
levels, and develop speed and agility.
Vocal quality and singing technique are other important criteria in the classification
of voices. A singer’s tone color is determined in part by anatomical features, which include
the mouth, nose, and throat as well as the vocal cords. But the cultivation of a particular
vocal timbre is also strongly influenced by aesthetic conventions and personal taste. A tight,
nasal tone is associated with many Asian and Arabic traditions, whereas opera and gospel
singers employ a chest voice with pronounced vibrato. Even within a single musical tradition
there may be fine distinctions based on the character and color of the voice. For example,
among operatic voices, a lyric soprano has a light, refined quality and a dramatic soprano a
powerful, emotional tone.
Most music for the voice involves the delivery of words. Indeed, speech itself, which is
characterized by both up and down pitch inflections and durational variations of individual
sounds, could be considered a primitive form of melody. The pitches of normal speech are
relatively narrow in range, neither a robot-like monotone nor extremes of high and low, but even
these modest fluctuations are important in punctuating the flow of ideas and communicating
emotion. The setting of words to music involves the purposeful shaping of melodic and other
musical elements and can invest a text with remarkable expressive power.
Vocal music is often identified as sacred or secular on the basis of its text. Sacred music
may be based on a scriptural text, the words of a religious ceremony, or deal with a religious
subject. The words in secular music may express feelings, narrate a story, describe activities
associated with work or play, comment on social or political situations, convey a nationalistic
message, and so on.
Western Categories of Instruments
Instruments are commonly classified in families, according to their method of generating
sounds. The most familiar designations for these groupings are strings (sound produced by
vibrating strings), winds (by a vibrating column of air), and percussion (by an object shaken
or struck).
The members of the string family of the Western orchestra are violin, viola, cello (or
violoncello), and bass (or double bass). All are similar in structure and appearance and also
quite homogeneous in tone color, although of different pitch ranges because of differences
in the length and diameter of their strings. Sound is produced by drawing a horsehair bow

across the strings, less often by plucking with the fingertips (called pizzicato). The harp is also
a member of the orchestral string family.
In wind instruments, the player blows through a mouthpiece that is attached to a conical
or cylindrical tube filled with air. The winds are subdivided into woodwinds and brass. The
nomenclature of the orchestral winds can be both confusing and misleading. For example,
the modern flute, classified as a woodwind, is made of metal while ancestors of some modern
brass instruments were made of wood; the French horn is a brass instrument, but the English
horn is a woodwind; and the saxophone, a relatively new instrument associated principally
with jazz and bands, is classified as a woodwind because its mouthpiece is similar to that of
the clarinet, although its body is metal.
The main orchestral woodwinds are flute, clarinet, oboe, and bassoon. Their very
distinctive tone colors are due in part to the different ways in which the air in the body of
the instrument is set in vibration. In the flute (and the piccolo) the player blows into the
mouthpiece at a sharp angle, in the clarinet into a mouthpiece with a single reed, and in the
oboe and bassoon (also the less common English horn) through two reeds bound together. In
all woodwinds, pitch is determined by varying the pressure of the breath in conjunction with
opening and closing holes along the side of the instrument, either with the fingers or by keys
and pads activated by the fingers.
The members of the brass family are wound lengths of metal tubing with a cupshaped mouthpiece at one end and a flared bell at the other. Pitch is controlled in part by
the pressure of the lips and amount of air, and also by altering the length of tubing either by
valves (trumpet, French horn, tuba) or by a sliding section of tube (trombone).
The percussion family encompasses a large and diverse group of instruments, which in
the Western system of classification are divided into pitched and nonpitched. The nucleus of
the orchestral percussion section consists of two, three, or four timpani, or kettledrums. Timpani
are tuned to specific pitches by varying the tension on the head that is stretched over the brass
bowl. The snare drum, bass drum, triangle, cymbals, marimba (or xylophone), tambourine,
castanets, and chimes are among the other instruments found in the percussion section of
an orchestra when called for in particular musical works. Percussionists usually specialize in
a particular instrument but are expected to be competent players of them all.
The piano, harpsichord, and organ constitute a separate category of instruments.
The harpsichord might be classified as a plucked string, the piano as both a string and a
percussion instrument since its strings are struck by felt-covered hammers, and the organ as
a wind instrument, its pipes being a collection of air-filled tubes. Because the mechanism of
the keyboard allows the player to produce several tones at once, keyboard instruments have
traditionally been treated as self-sufficient rather than as members of an orchestral section.
Counterparts to the Western orchestral instruments are found in musical cultures
all over the world. Among the strings are the Indian sitar, the Japanese koto, the Russian
balalaika, and the Spanish guitar. Oboe-type instruments are found throughout the Middle
East and bamboo flutes occur across Asia and Latin America. Brass-like instruments include
the long straight trumpets used by Tibetan monks and instruments made from animal horns
and tusks, such as the Jewish shofar. Percussion instruments are probably the most numerous
and diverse, from simple folk instruments like gourd rattles filled with pebbles, notched sticks
rubbed together, and hollow log drums, to the huge tempered metal gongs of China, the bronze
xylophones of Indonesia, and the tuned steel drums of the Caribbean.

MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS AND ENSEMBLES

Ensembles
The word “ensemble” comes from the French meaning “together” and is a broad concept
that encompasses groupings of various constituencies and sizes. Ensembles can be made
up of singers alone, instruments alone, singers and instruments together, two performers or
hundreds. Ensemble performance is part of virtually every musical tradition. Examples of
large ensembles are the symphony orchestra, marching band, jazz band, West Indian steel
pan orchestra, Indonesia gamelan, African drum ensembles, chorus, and gospel choir. In such
large groups, performers are usually divided into sections, each with its particular material or
function. So, for example, all the tenors in a chorus sing the same music, and all the alto saxes
in a jazz big band play the same part. Usually a conductor or lead performer is responsible
for keeping everyone together.
The large vocal ensemble most familiar to Westerners is the chorus, twenty or more
singers grouped in soprano, alto, tenor, and bass sections. The designation choir is sometimes
used for choruses that sing religious music. There is also literature for choruses comprised of
men only, women only, and children. Small vocal ensembles, in which there are one to three
singers per part, include the chamber chorus and barber shop quartet. Vocal ensemble music
is sometimes intended to be performed a cappella, that is, by voices alone, and sometimes with
instruments. Choral numbers are commonly included in operas, oratorios, and musicals.
The most important large instrumental ensemble in the Western tradition is the
symphony orchestra. Orchestras such as the New York Philharmonic, Brooklyn Philharmonic,
and those of the New York City Opera and Metropolitan Opera, consist of 40 or more players,
depending on the requirements of the music they are playing. The players are grouped by
family into sections – winds, brass, percussion and strings. Instruments from different sections
frequently double each other, one instrument playing the same material as another, although
perhaps in different octaves. Thus, while a symphony by Mozart may have parts for three
sections, the melody given to the first violins is often identical to that of the flutes and clarinets;
the bassoons, cellos and basses may join forces in playing the bass line supporting that melody
while the second violins, violas, and French horns are responsible for the pitches that fill out
the harmony. The term orchestration refers to the process of designating particular musical
material to particular instruments.
The origins of the orchestra in Western Europe date back to the early baroque and the
rise of opera, for which composers wrote instrumental overtures, accompaniments to vocal
numbers, and dances. In this early period, the ensemble typically consisted of about 16 to 20
strings plus a harpsichord, called the continuo, that doubled the bass line and filled out the
harmonies. Other instruments could be included, but primarily as soloists rather than regular
members. The designation chamber orchestra is sometimes applied to these early orchestras,
reflecting the fact that, during the Baroque period, orchestral music was often composed as
entertainment for the nobility and performed in the rooms, or chambers, of their palaces,
rather than the large concert halls of today.
During the classical period, the orchestra expanded in size to between 40 and 60 players.
Strings remain the heart of the ensemble, but there are more of them, and by the early 19th
century, pairs of flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, French horns, trumpets and timpani had
become standard members. For the most part, the woodwinds double the strings, the horns
fill out the harmonies, and the trumpets and timpani add rhythmic emphasis. For many
composers of the 19th century, exploring the timbral possibilities of the orchestra became an
increasingly important aspect of the creative process. The ensemble of the romantic period
grew to 80 or more players through the increase in the numbers of instruments of the classical
orchestra and the addition of new ones – piccolo, English horn, contrabassoon, trombone,

13

14

MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS AND ENSEMBLES
tuba, harp, celeste, cymbals, triangle, a variety of drums. Scores also called for special effects
such as muting – muffling or altering the sound of string instruments by placing a wooden
clamp placed across the bridge, or brass instruments by inserting material into the bell. There
is no single concept of the orchestra in the 20th century. Composers have written for chamber
ensembles and for gigantic forces; they have used traditional instrumentations but also
further extended the palette of musical tone colors by incorporating non-western instruments,
invented instruments, electronically altered instruments, and non-musical sound sources such
as sirens. Some have approached the orchestra not as the deliverer of melody, rhythm, and
harmony, but as a palette of tone colors, to be mixed, juxtaposed, manipulated, ordered, and
experienced as a sonic collage.
The jazz big band is another example of a large ensemble. The instruments are
typically divided into the reed section (saxes, sometimes clarinets), the brass section (trumpets,
trombones, sometimes cornets), and the rhythm section (commonly piano, guitar, string bass,
and drum set). The rhythm section – which appears in most groups, large and small – is
responsible for maintaining the rhythm (hence the name) as well as the harmony on which
the featured soloists are improvising. Because of their size, jazz big bands often play from
written arrangements (see Chapter 7: Jazz)
The gamelan of Indonesia is an example of a large non-Western ensemble. The
distinctive sound of the gamelan is created by metallophones, that is, instruments made of
metal and struck with a mallet. Some resemble small, medium, and large xylophones, but
with tuned bars of bronze instead of wood. Some look like a collection of lidded cooking kettles
of different sizes. The layers of melody created by these instruments are punctuated by gongs,
chimes, and drums. The gamelan accompanies ceremonial plays and dances and is deeply
connected to religious rituals. The instruments themselves are charged with charismatic power
and are often intricately carved and brilliantly painted with figures and designs that replicate
elements of cosmological forces.
Another type of grouping found in many musical traditions consists of a small number
of players – from 2 to 8 or 9 – each of whom has a separate, unique part. An important feature
of small ensembles is an overall balance among the individual performers, so that one does
not overpower the others. Instead, every member of the group plays an essential role in the
presentation and development of musical ideas. Instead of a conductor, the performers rely on
eye contact, careful listening and sensitivity to each other that may have developed over years
of rehearsing and playing together. In the western classical tradition, such small groups are
classified as chamber ensembles and include the string quartet (2 violins, viola, cello), piano
trio (piano, violin, cello), and wind quintet (flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, French horn). A
comparable small group in jazz is a jazz combo. Like the jazz big band, the jazz combo uses
a rhythm section, but in place of reed and brass sections, a handful of additional improvising
instruments. One preferred combination is the jazz quintet, made up of trumpet, saxophone,
and rhythm section of piano, bass, and drums. Miles Davis’s famous quintet of the 1960s used
this instrumentation. Other examples of small instrumental groupings include a bluegrass
band, Klezmer band, rock band, and trio of players of Indian ragas.

CHAPTER 3: COMPOSER, PERFORMER, AUDIENCE

Composition and performance are related and sometimes inseparable activities in the
creation of music (as they are also in theater and dance). In the Western tradition, the roles
of performer and composer have often been the province of separate people, a composer,
playwright, or choreographer authoring a work that is then brought to life by others who are
skilled as instrumentalists/vocalists, actors, or dancers. Compositions are preserved in some
kind of written form or passed on through oral tradition. The “work” thus has an existence
that is separate from its performance; it is an independent entity to be brought to life each
time it is performed, or re-created. Conservatory training in the performing arts typically
covers both creative and interpretative functions, and individuals frequently cross over from
one to the other.
In traditions heavily based on improvisation, such as Indian classical music, African
tribal music, and jazz, the performers are the composers and the performance is the work.
Improvisations are sometimes recorded, or later written down based on memory. But
evanescence is a defining aspect of extemporaneous creation. Many performance traditions
involve preexisting material that the performer is expected to flesh out in the course of
performance. Indeed, some degree of spontaneity is part of any live performance and no
two performances of the same work, no matter how meticulously notated, will be identical.
Whatever the relationship between creation and performance, composition is a highly
disciplined art that requires mastery over often very sophisticated materials and a creative
impulse whose origins and mental processes remain a mystery.
Performance practice refers to the conventions and customs associated with the
performance of a particular musical repertory—for example, the instruments employed,
techniques of singing, and the nature and extent of improvisation that are expected.
Prior to the invention of recording technologies, how music actually sounded had
to be deduced from written descriptions, archeological remains, and pictorial material. An
“authentic” performance is particularly challenging in the re-creation of older music, whether
from oral tradition, in which case it has typically undergone changes in the course of its
transmission, or from notated repertoires that fell into obscurity as they were eclipsed by newer
styles and tastes. The study of performance practice is an active and often controversial area
of contemporary music scholarship.
Over the past 50 years, the performance of early music from the Western tradition has
become increasingly the province of specialists trained in performance practices that have
long been obsolete. For example, singers of medieval and Renaissance music cultivate a
vocal style that is different from that employed in music of later periods, and instrumentalists
learn techniques associated with playing period instruments, either old instruments that have
been preserved or modern reproductions. Professional early music groups are usually led

15

16

COMPOSER, PERFORMER, AUDIENCE
by scholar/performers devoted to the discovery and study of older repertory, and to seeking
solutions to the many unanswered questions about the interpretation of early music. Many
music schools, conservatories, and college music departments offer courses in the history and
performance practice of early music and the opportunity to perform in early music ensembles.
Churches, art galleries, museums, and small concert halls are favorite venues for live concerts
of early music.
Likewise, groups of musicians and scholars have become devoted to the revival and
preservation of a variety of older vernacular music traditions. Historical recordings have
become a vital part of the process of re-creating performance practices and authentic style. For
example, using commercial recordings from the 1920s and 1930s in conjunction with written
scores and charts, contemporary jazz repertory bands have re-created the sounds of early New
Orleans jazz and big band swing music. Field recordings of traditional ballads, blues, and
hillbilly bands made during the Depression years fueled the urban folk music revival of the
1960s and early 1970s. Today an array of “ethnic” folk styles, ranging from Irish fiddling
and Jewish klezmer to Caribbean and African drumming to Asian folk dance music are being
studied and faithfully re-created for new audiences around the world. The advent of recording
technology and new delivery systems (broadcast, cable, satellite, Internet, etc.) have collapsed
time and space to make a panoply of world music performance practices and styles available
to an ever expanding global audience.
Social Setting and Performance Rules
The relationship between the performers and audience members is highly dependent on the
social setting in which a particular musical event takes place. The rules that govern proper
performance will vary from setting to setting, and from culture to culture. In the western
concert tradition, for example, the performers sit on a raised presidium stage which provides a
spatial separation between them and their audience. Audience members are expected to sit in
silent contemplation during the performance (cell phones off please!), clapping only when the
conductor walks on stage, at the end of a piece and at the end of the concert (not in-between
movements or after solos, except at the opera where applause and shouts of bravo, brava,
and bravi are customary expressions of approval). At an African American gospel service, in
contrast, the singers may leave the stage and walk/run/dance out among audience members
who are expected to clap, stamp, and shout encouragement to the performers throughout a
song. At a jazz club quiet talk is usually permissible, and audience members are expected to
clap not only at the end of a piece but also after a particularly moving solo is played by one
of the performers.
In many social settings audience members do more than sit and listen. At a wedding
or at a dance club, for example, audience members dance in a designated space in front of the
ensemble, and the musicians are expected to play an appropriate repertoire for the event and
the indented audience. One expects a certain type of music and dancing at a rock or blues
club, another at a salsa club, and another at a Jewish, Italian, or Greek wedding. Dancers
may shout encouragement and make requests to the band, and musicians often watch the
dancers to determine how long to keep a piece going, or whether to play a fast or slow piece
next. In various Afro-Caribbean religious rituals the musicians drum and chant to call down
the spirits to worshipers who dance and trance in special areas of the ceremony. In outdoor
events like West Indian Carnival, the musicians and the dancers often merge into one dancing
throng to the point where it is impossible to differentiate the performers from the audience
members.
All musical performances are governed by rules that are setting and culture specific.
The next time you plan to hear a live music performance, think about the expectations
for performer and audience interaction that are appropriate for that particular setting. If
you find yourself in an unfamiliar situation, be observant and see if you can determine the
appropriate rules.

CHAPTER 4: EUROPEAN ART MUSIC: MIDDLE AGES THROUGH ROMANTIC

Middle Ages (ca. 450 to ca. 1450)
The period in the history of Western Europe, today called the Middle Ages, begins around
450 A.D. What had once been a vast empire dominated by Roman law and culture fell apart
in consequence of a series of incursions by the Goths, Huns, and other “barbarian” tribes.
Europe became a feudal society in which the majority of the population was peasants, or
serfs. The landowners were noblemen who lived in tapestry-hung castles in walled villages,
some of which are the antecedents of European cities of today. To fight the almost constant
wars with each other, powerful lords raised their sons to be warriors, knights who pledged to
follow codes of loyalty and chivalry. When not engaged in battles, these armored fighters
participated in elaborate tournaments for the entertainment of the court. Knights also joined
the crusades, multi-year Christian expeditions to the Middle East to recapture the Holy Land
from Moslem rule.
As Christianity spread during the Middle Ages, great cathedrals were built across
Europe as places of public worship, each presided over by a bishop appointed by the pope.
Monasteries and convents were established as self-sufficient religious communities where
monks and nuns lived in isolation from the outside world. At a time when the population
was essentially illiterate, monasteries were centers of learning. Monks copied and illustrated
religious manuscripts as well as books that preserved writings of Arabic and Greek scholars.
Monasteries have a special significance in the history of European music. The intoning
of sacred texts, a practice the early Christians borrowed from other religions, was an important
element of their liturgy. The chants sung in the services, some of them of ancient origin, were
passed on through oral tradition, undoubtedly undergoing changes in the process. In order
to bring some organization to this huge body of melodies, monks formulated principles for
classifying the scales on which they were based, the church modes. They also experimented
with methods of writing them down. Monophonic chants constituted the core of the repertory,
but there were also practices of performing chants with one or more melodies added to them,
an early form of polyphony. The system that the monks ultimately developed, essentially the
staff of lines and spaces in use today, accomplished not only the exact fixing of the pitches of
a melody, but allowed for the notation of two or more simultaneous melodies that graphically
represented their relationship to one another. Observations about these relationships led to
concepts of consonance and dissonance and to early rules for creating new music of two or
more parts. What was originally intended as a mechanism for preserving existing music
17

laid the foundations for Western theories of counterpoint and harmony. Those principles
and practices made possible the composition of music of great textural complexity and are
themselves among the major intellectual achievements in human history.

Renaissance (ca. 1450–1600)
The designation “Renaissance” dates from the 18th century and reflects the revival of interest
in the classical civilizations of Greece and Rome that profoundly influenced the culture and
thinking of the century and a half following the Middle Ages. The period is also called the
Age of Humanism because of the emphasis on the nature, potential, and accomplishments
of man in literature, art and music, science, and philosophy. The medieval approach to
understanding the world, which was based on speculative systems of divine order and harmony,
was supplanted by theories derived from scientific observation. Learning was highly valued
and, through the invention of printing, became available to a wide population. Other
important inventions are the telescope and instruments for navigation used by explorers such
as Columbus and Magellan.
The Catholic Church remained an important institution during the Renaissance, but
diminished in influence in consequence of the wealth and power of families such as the Medici
of Florence and the Estes of Ferrara, whose courts became centers of culture, learning, and
military might. The Reformation, which began with Martin Luther’s criticisms of Church
abuses, had its greatest impact in Germany. Other breakaway movements followed in France
and Switzerland, as well as in England, where Henry VIII defied the authority of the pope and
declared himself head of a new Anglican church. Wars between Catholics and Protestants
are part of the history of many of the countries that broke with Rome.
In music and the other arts, patronage by royalty, who competed in maintaining
splendid courts as well as chapels, spurred the development of secular forms of artistic
expression.
Whether secular or sacred, Renaissance art, sculpture, and architecture embody the
ideals of balance, clarity, and emotional restraint that characterized the classicism of the
Greeks. In music, where no ancient models survived, that aesthetic found expression in a
style that evolved from concepts of consonance and dissonance developed in the Middle Ages
but with new emphasis on harmonious sonorities. The predominant texture consisted of
soprano, alto, tenor, and bass voice parts creating a highly contrapuntal web in which the
lines diverge, converge, cross, echo, and imitate each other, sometimes with great rhythmic
independence, sometimes moving together in the manner of a hymn. In setting religious
texts, composers strove for an atmosphere of serenity and spirituality, in the setting of secular
texts, for vivid representation of words and images. Instrumental music continued to be of
secondary importance to composers, whose approach to writing for instruments was usually
the same as that for voices. For example, published collections of dances required unspecified
instruments of soprano, alto, tenor, and bass range—in essence vocal pieces without words.
Some composers, however, began to explore shaping musical material in ways that exploited
the unique features of the instruments on which it would be performed.

EUROPEAN ART MUSIC: BAROQUE
Baroque (ca. 1600–1750)
Many of the historic events in Europe during the 17th and early 18th centuries are extensions
of forces that shaped and defined the Renaissance. The explorations of the 16th century were
followed by the establishment of more and more colonies in the New World. In the sphere of
intellectual activity, the scientific methodologies and discoveries of Copernicus and Galileo laid
the foundations for the work of Kepler and Newton, and the philosophers Descartes, Spinoza,
and Locke embraced the Renaissance pursuit of truth through reason. Religious conflicts
engendered by the Reformation continued to erupt throughout the 17th century. In the area
that is now Germany, tensions between Protestants and Catholics following the Reformation
ignited a catastrophic Thirty Years War, during the course of which half the population
died. The history of England is also a violent one, with such bloody deeds as the beheading
of Mary Queen of Scots and Charles I, both Catholics, and the posthumous hanging and
dismemberment of Oliver Cromwell, a commoner and Puritan who became England’s Lord
Protector during the Commonwealth period. The powers of the absolute monarch reached
new heights in France, whose citizens were heavily taxed to support Louis XIV and the 20,000
courtiers who lived at the extravagant palace he had built for himself at Versailles.
These were some of the contexts in which artists worked during the approximately
150-year period of the Baroque. As in the Renaissance, popes, cardinals, monarchs, and
members of the aristocracy continued to use art as a symbol of power and wealth. But artists
and musicians also created works for a wider public. The art, architecture, and music they
created exhibit features that are characteristic of romantic expression—intense emotion,
flamboyance, and dynamic movement. For subjects, painters and sculptors were drawn to
dramatic moments from mythology, ancient history, and the Bible, which they depicted with
elaborate decoration, vivid color, and bold use of light and shadow. They also portrayed scenes
from everyday life that were displayed in the homes of the rising middle class. Architecture,
often grandiose in scale, employed sweeping lines, high domes, columns, and statues, all
overlaid with ornamental detail. The taste for dramatic expression in conjunction with the
opening of public concert halls created a supportive climate for the emergence of opera and
oratorio and of new instrumental genres independent of vocal music such as the sonata,
concerto, and suite. In their pursuit of dramatic intensity, composers introduced strongly
contrasting effects—between loud and soft, between soloist and large group, between voices
and instruments—and developed a vocabulary of devices that associated particular keys,
meters, rhythmic figures, and instruments with specific emotional states, such as anger, love,
joy, and grief.

EUROPEAN ART MUSIC: CLASSICAL

26

Classical (Enlightenment Period) (ca. 1750–ca. 1820)
The term classical, when used in the context of works of art, refers to features such proportion
and symmetry that characterize the sculpture and architecture of ancient Greece and Rome
and also the art of subsequent periods that display those features. Classicists embrace the
notion of universal ideals of beauty and strive in art to achieve universality through the
representation of ideal forms.
It is for this reason that the period that followed the Baroque, when the flamboyance
and drama were supplanted by emotional restraint and formal balance and symmetry, is
called Classical. The 18th century is also called the Enlightenment Period, because of the ideals
of reason, objectivity, and scientific knowledge found in the writings of Diderot, Voltaire, and
Lessing that permeated all aspects of European society and culture. Thomas Jefferson, John
Adams, and Ben Franklin are among the Americans who shared the belief in human progress
and natural rights, that is, the rights of the individual as opposed to the rights of the state,
as embodied in a monarch. These ideas led to the American Revolution, then the French
Revolution, with its slogan “Liberty, Equality, Fraternity.”
Both the aesthetics of classicism and the Enlightenment world view shaped the art of the
second half of the 18th and early 19th centuries. As in the Renaissance, architects once again
found inspiration in the proportion and grace of Greek and Roman temples. Robert Burns’s
poems in Scottish dialect, Jane Austen’s novels about life in a country village, and Schiller’s
plays about aspirations for freedom and brotherhood are testaments to enlightenment notions
of the dignity and worth of the common man.
In music, composers of the early classical period discarded complex textures, learned
compositional techniques such as fugal imitation, and grandeur in favor of transparent
textures, a single melody supported by a subordinate accompaniment, and somewhat
superficial sentiments. In the mature classical style of Haydn, Mozart, and early Beethoven,
counterpoint, processes of rigorous development, and depth of expression reappear, but in the
context of classical ideals of clarity, proportion, and refined taste. Important developments
during the period include expansion of the orchestra to thirty or forty players, improvements
in the mechanisms of instruments, especially the piano, and ever greater public support
through concerts and publication of music.

EUROPEAN ART MUSIC: ROMANTIC
Romantic (ca. 1820–1900)
In many respects, the social and political history of 19th century Europe and the United States
is a continuation of trends and movements rooted in the previous century: secularization,
industrialization, democratization. But the way in which artists perceived, interpreted, and
expressed the world was informed by a romantic aesthetic. As a general descriptive, romantic
is applied to literature, visual arts, and music that emphasize imagination over objective
observation, intense emotion over reason, freedom and spontaneity over order and control,
individual over universal experience. The romantics of the 19th century sought inspiration in
nature (poetry of Wordsworth, paintings of Constable and Turner), mythology and folklore
(stories of E. T. A. Hoffmann), and the past (Keats, Ode on a Grecian Urn; Dumas, The Three
Musketeers). They idolized tragic heroic figures (Sir Walter Scott’s novel Ivanhoe), and the artist
as visionary (Walt Whitman, “I celebrate myself, and sing myself”). And they were fascinated
by subjects associated with dreams (Goya’s The Dream of Reason), oppression, injustice, and
political struggle (novels of Dickens, Victor Hugo’s Les Miserable), the macabre (stories of Edgar
Allen Poe), and death (poems of Emily Dickinson). The lives of many romantics were marked
by the restlessness, longing, and unhappy love relationships they depicted through their art
(the English poets Byron and Shelley).
Music was in a number of respects the perfect romantic art form. In the words of the
composer Franz Liszt, “Music embodies feeling without forcing it to contend and combine with
thought…” Music was used as a vehicle for expression of personal emotion, for awakening
nationalistic aspirations, and for the display of virtuosity. Composers continued to use genres
they inherited from past, such as the symphony, concerto, piano sonata, and opera, but also
developed repertories particularly associated with the 19th century, such as the art song and
instrumental program music. Whatever the form, romantic composers spoke a musical
language infused with poetic lyricism, harmonic complexity, and dramatic contrasts. The
requirements of their orchestral scores led to the expansion of the orchestra, both in size,
to eighty or more players, and in its palette of instrumental colors through the addition of
trombones and tubas, piccolo and contrabassoon, harp, cymbals, triangle, and a variety of
drums. The concept of what constituted a single work encompassed the extremes from short,
intimate songs and piano miniatures of Schubert and Schumann intended to be performed in
intimate surroundings, to the operas of Wagner and symphonies of the late romantic written
for large concert halls and demanding enormous performing resources.

CHAPTER 5: EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN ART MUSIC SINCE 1900

As has been true of all periods, music of the last hundred or so years is related to past traditions
yet has developed modes of expression that are distinctly modern and depart from earlier
practices. Works of art are always in some respect reflective of the time in which they were
created and, conversely, shape our perception of the period in which they were produced. Some
music readily speaks to us because we are in some way connected to its historical and cultural
context, yet often the closer works of art are to us in time, the more alien and inaccessible they
seem. This is not a new phenomenon. Artists have traditionally been visionaries, creators of
new ways of experiencing and communicating that challenge our comprehension. Insight
into the circumstances of a work’s genesis and what the composer set out to accomplish can
help us listen with more sympathy and understanding.
In the early decades of the 20th century, many creative artists were reacting against the
aesthetics and values of Romanticism. The composer Igor Stravinsky and the painter/sculptor
Pablo Picasso are among the important figures whose works reflect their interest in tribal
societies and the primitive, ritualistic dimension of the human psyche that was the subject of
Freud’s research and writings. One of the most radical departures from past music traditions
was Arnold Schoenberg’s “method of composing with twelve tones” that rejected principles
of a key center and the distinction between consonance and dissonance that had been the
foundation of Western music for centuries. Because of the absence of a tonic, twelve-tone
music is often called “atonal,” a term to which Schoenberg objected, or “serial” because the
compositional technique involves manipulation of a germinal series of pitches. Schoenberg’s
theoretical writings and his serial works have had great impact on subsequent generations
of composers. While twelve-tone describes Schoenberg’s compositional procedure, his style is
classified as expressionist. Expressionism was an early 20th-century movement that sought
to reveal through art the irrational, subconscious reality and repressed primordial impulses
postulated and analyzed in the writings of Freud.
Another important development during the early decades of the 20 th century
was awakening of interest among American visual artists, novelists, poets, playwrights,
choreographers, and composers in creating works that reflected a distinctly American, as
opposed to a European, sensibility. In music, the renowned Czech composer Antonin Dvorak,
who visited the United States during the 1890s, challenged Americans to compose their own
music based on native folk materials. His own Symphony # 9 (1893), written during his stay in
America, was evocative of the African American spiritual. By the 1920s American composers
like George Gershwin and Aaron Copland were incorporating the rhythms and blues tonality
of jazz into their symphonic works. Gershwin’s 1924 piece, Rhapsody in Blue, is the best-known
work from this genre. During the 1930s and early 1940s, Copland, Gershwin, Virgil Thomson,

33

34

EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN ART MUSIC SINCE 1900
and Roy Harris drew from an array of American folk styles including spirituals, blues, cowboy
songs, folk hymns, and fiddle tunes in composing their populist symphonic works.
American composers of the early 20th century also sought to create distinctly new works
by engaging in radical experimentation. Charles Ives, writing in the first two decades of the
century, was the first American to move away from the Romantic European conventions of
form and style by employing dissonance, atonality, complex rhythms, and nonlinear structures.
These ideas were continued by the American experimental composers Henry Cowell, Conlon
Nancarrow, Edgar Varèse, and Ruth Crawford Seeger in the 1920s and 1930s. By the 1940s
and into the post–World War II years, American avant-garde composer John Cage would
challenge listeners to completely rethink what constituted music and art through his radically
experimental works that drew from new technology, performance art, and Eastern systems
of thought and aesthetics. Cage paved the way for the so-called “downtown” New York
experimental scene that broke down barriers between music, visual art, performance, and so
forth. Cage’s interest in non-Western music inspired the minimalist composers including Terry
Riley, Steve Reich, and Philip Glass, who would draw on African and Asian musical systems
in the 1960s and 1970s.
This interest in non-Western music in the last 50 years is a result of the unprecedented
contact between different cultures. For most of human history, musical repertories have
evolved largely in isolation from one another, so musical experiences have been principally
confined to the music of an individual’s own immediate culture. Today the opportunities to
hear music and the types of music that are available have expanded dramatically as a result
of modern technology and increased contact among peoples. Modern modes of travel and
communication and technologies for recording music invented since the end of the 19th century
have removed barriers that isolated different musical traditions and repertories from each other.
A typical music store in the United States today has sections devoted to recordings covering
the entire span of European classical music from the Middle Ages to the present, world music,
and repertories that evolved during the 20th century such as jazz and rock. Music from distant
times and places is also featured in the programming of some radio stations, television stations,
and online music sites. Residents of large cities and those living near college campuses have
opportunities to hear live performances by musicians trained in other cultural traditions or
specializing in early music, as well as concerts by orchestras, opera companies, and soloists
performing standard classical repertory. For musicians, the globalization of music has opened
new doors and dissolved old boundaries. Performers study and gain mastery in repertoires of
cultures other than their own, and composers can draw on literally the entire world of music
in creating new crossover styles.
Modern technology has made possible not only the preservation and broad
dissemination of music, but has also become a source for the generation and manipulation
of musical sounds. One of the earliest devices that created musical sounds by electronic
means, the Theremin (named after its inventor, the Russian scientist, Leon Theremin) was
introduced in the early 1920s. Using the numerous technologies that were developed in the
following decades, composers recorded musical tones or natural sounds that they transformed
by mechanical and electronic means and sometimes supplemented with others generated
electronically in a studio. This raw material was then assembled for playback, either as a
self-sufficient composition or combined with live performance. Today, technology-based
composition has become a widely available process through the storage of sound samples in
home computers. Synthesized, sampled, and digitally altered sounds are commonly used for
special effects in popular music, movie scores, and works for the concert hall. There is also a
repertory in which the tone color dimension of sound is what the work is about. Comparable
to the abstract painter whose materials are the basic elements of shape and color, the composer
constructs a succession of aural events of unique tone color, dynamics, and registration.

CHAPTER 6: AMERICAN VERNACULAR MUSIC

Introduction
Western culture has tended to divide musical practices into two very broad fields, the vernacular
and the cultivated. Vernacular refers to everyday, informal musical practices located outside
the official arena of high culture—the conservatory, the concert hall, and the high church.
The field of vernacular music is often further subdivided into the domains of folk music (orally
transmitted and community based) and popular music (mediated for a mass audience).
Cultivated music, often referred to as classical or art music, is associated with formal training
and written composition. The boundaries between so-called folk, popular, and classical music
are becoming increasingly blurred as we enter into the 21st century, due to the pervasive
effects of mass media that have made music of all American ethnic/racial groups, classes,
and regions available to everyone.
Historians and musicologists now agree that America’s most distinctive musical
expressions are found, or have roots in, its vernacular music. Early immigrants from Western
Europe and the slaves stolen from Africa brought with them rich traditions of oral folk music
that mixed and mingled throughout the 18th and 19th centuries to develop uniquely American
ballads, instrumental dance music, and spirituals. By the early 20th century, the folk blues
emerged and would go on to form the foundation of much of our popular music. Beginning
with 19th century minstrel and parlor song collections, and threading through the 20th century
recordings of Tin Pan Alley song, gospel, rhythm and blues, country, rock, soul, and rap, the
print and electronic media fueled the growth of American popular musical styles that today
have proliferated across the globe. Jazz, sometimes considered America’s “classical” music,
certainly had roots in early 20th century folk and popular styles (see Chapter 7: Jazz). And
many of America’s best-known classical composers including George Gershwin, Aaron Copland,
Virgil Thomson, and Duke Ellington based their extended compositions on vernacular folk
and popular themes (see Chapter 5: European and American Art Music since 1900).
American Folk Music
Folk music was once thought of as being simple, old, anonymously composed music played
by poor, rural, nonliterate people representing the lower strata of our society (mountain
hillbillies, southern black sharecroppers, cowboys, etc.). Today scholars have expanded the
field by defining folk music as orally transmitted songs and instrumental expressions that are
passed on in community settings and generally show a degree of stability over time. Rather
than viewing folk expressions as vanishing antiquities, this perspective suggests folk music
can be a dynamic process that continues to flourish within many communities of our modern
society. Using this model popular music may be defined as mass-mediated expression that

changes rapidly over time, and classical/art music as musical practices centered in formal
training and written composition.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, American folk music collectors wrote down
the words and melodies to a variety of traditional expressions including Native American
ritual songs, African American spirituals and work songs, Anglo American ballads and fiddle
tunes, and western cowboy songs. Later they broadened their interest to include the traditional
expressions of ethnic and immigrant communities such as the practices of Hispanic, Irish,
Jewish, Caribbean, and Chinese Americans, most of whom lived in urban areas. With the
advent of portable recording technology in the 1930s, folklorists like Alan Lomax began the
task of documenting America’s folk music and compiling the Archive of American Folk Song,
which today, along with the Smithsonian Folkways Recordings, offers students the chance to
hear and study authentic regional folk styles.
Most Anglo and African American folk genres are built around relatively simple (often
pentatonic) melodies, duple or triple meter time signatures, and a series of harmonic structures
built around the tonic, subdominant, and dominant chords. But much of the emotional appeal
of folk music comes from the grain or tension of the voice. Vocal textures vary greatly, ranging
from the high, tense, nasal delivery associated with white mountain singers, to the more
relaxed, throaty, rough timbre of southern African American blues and spiritual singers.
In addition to studying song texts and melodies, folk music scholars have paid a great
deal of attention to the social function of folk music. They seek to understand how a particular
song or instrumental piece works within a specific social situation for a particular group of
people. For example, how do Native American chants and African American spirituals operate
within the context of a religious or worship ceremony; how are Anglo and Celtic American
fiddle tunes central to Appalachian and community gatherings; how did traditional blues
and ballads reflect contrasting world views of southern blacks and whites; and how do West
Indian steel bands and Jewish klezmer ensembles serve as markers of cultural pride?
The self-conscious revival of folk music by middle-class urban Americans has been
going on since the 1930s. During the Depression and WWII years, folk artists like Louisianaborn Huddie “Lead Belly” Ledbetter and Oklahoma-born Woody Guthrie introduced city
audiences to rural folk music, and along with left-leaning topical folk singers like Pete Seeger,
they helped spawn the great folk revival of the post–World War II years. Folk music spilled
into the popular arena with artists like the Kingston Trio; Burl Ives; Peter, Paul & Mary; and
Bob Dylan writing and recording hit folk songs.
Anglo American Ballads
Ballads are basically folk songs that tell stories through the introduction of characters in a
specific situation, the building up of dramatic tension, and the resolution of that tension.
Ballads were originally brought to America by British, Scottish, and Scotch-Irish immigrants,
many of whom eventually settled in the mountainous regions of the American south.
The melodies of Anglo American ballads are simple, often built around archaic sounding
pentatonic (five note) and hexatonic (six-tone) scales that may feature large jumps or gaps
between notes. Songs are traditionally sung a cappella in a free meter style, or with simple
guitar or banjo accompaniment. The voice is delivered in a high, tense, nasal style.
Ballads are most often set in four line stanzas, with the second and fourth line
rhyming:
I was born in West Virginia,
among the beautiful hills.
And the memory of my childhood,
lies deep within me still.

AMERICAN VERNACULAR MUSIC
While older British and Scottish ballads found in the American South dealt with themes of
ancient kings, queens, and magical happenings in faraway places, the 18th- and 19th -century
ballads that developed in America tell stories of everyday folk involved in everyday life events,
usually set in the present or recent past. Sentimental and tragic love stories, often involving
violence and death, were common. Many American ballads express strong moral sentiments,
warning listeners about the consequences of irresponsible behavior:
I courted a fair maiden,
her name I will not tell
For I have now disgraced her,
and I am doomed to hell.
It was on one beautiful evening,
the stars were shining bright
And with that faithful dagger,
I did her spirit flight.
So justice overtook me,
you all can plainly see.
My soul is doomed forever,
throughout eternity.
The sentimental and tragic themes of Anglo American ballads, along with the high-pitched,
“whiny” vocal style, have survived and flourished in 20th-century popular country music.
African American Spirituals and Gospel Music
The African American Spiritual has its origins in the religious practices of 18th- and 19th -century
American slaves who converted to Christianity during the great awakening revivals. The earliest
spirituals were African-style ring shouts, based on simple call and response lyrics chanted
against a driving rhythm produced by clapping and foot stomping. Participants would shuffle
around in a ring-formation and “shout” when they felt the spirit. More complex melodies
and verse/chorus structures began to evolve, reflecting the influence of European American
hymn singing, and accompaniment by guitar, piano, and percussion became common. Vocal
ornamentations (slides, glides, extended use of falsetto), call and response singing, and blues
tonality characterized these folk spirituals. In the reconstruction period black college choirs
such as the Fisk Jubilee Singers arranged folk spirituals into four-part harmony, a form that
became known as the concert spiritual. A blend of African and European musical practices,
the spiritual epitomizes the sycretic (blended) nature of much American folk music resulting
from the mixing of Africans and Europeans in the Americas.
The texts of many spirituals are taken from Old Testament themes and stories. The
slaves were particularly moved by Old Testament figures like Daniel (who was saved from the
lion’s den), Jonah (who was delivered from the belly of the whale), Noah (who survived the
flood), and David (who defeated the giant Goliath) who struggled and triumphed over adverse
conditions. The plight of the Israelites and their escape from bondage to the promised land
was an especially powerful story retold by the spirituals:

41

AMERICAN VERNACULAR MUSIC

42

When Israel was in Egypt’s land,
O let my people go!
Oppressed so hard they could not stand,
O let my people go!
Go Down, Moses,
Away down to Egypt’s land.
And tell old Pharaoh,
To let my people go!
The spiritual’s emphasis on redemption and deliverance in this world have led historians
to suggest the songs had double meaning for the slaves—they affirmed their belief in the Bible
as well as their trust that a just God would deliver them from the evils of slavery. The spirituals
are thus seen as expressions of religious faith and resistance to slavery.
In the 20th-century spirituals evolved into the more urban, New Testament–centered
gospel songs. Following the first “great migration” of southern African Americans to urban
centers like Chicago, New York, and Philadelphia in the post–Word War I years, a new genre
of black American sacred songs known as gospel began to appear. Unlike the anonymous folk
spirituals, gospel songs were composed and copyrighted by songwriters like Thomas Dorsey
and Reverend William Herbert Brewster, and by the 1930s were being recorded by urban
church singers. Some, like Mahalia Jackson, the Dixie Hummingbirds, and the Ward Singers,
turned professional and reached national and international audiences through their tours
and recordings. But most gospel singing remained rooted in African American church ritual,
and to this day can be heard in black communities throughout the north and south.
Musically, gospel is a blending of spirituals, blues, and the song sermons of the black
preacher. Gospel songs are usually organized in a 16- or 32-bar verse/chorus form, often
featuring call-and-response singing between a leader and a chorus. Blues tonalities are
common, and singers are known for their intensive vocal ornamentations, which include
bending and slurring notes, falsetto swoops, and melismas (groups of notes or tones sung
across one syllable of a word). Gospel singers often end a song with a prolonged section of
improvisation that combines singing, chanting, and shouting in hopes of “bringing down
the spirit.” Lyrics are most often New Testament–centered, focusing on the redeeming power
of Jesus and the singer’s personal relationship with the Savior.
Although gospel lyrics are strictly religious in nature, gospel music derives much of its
sound from blues and jazz. Likewise, gospel music has been a source for various secular styles,
including early rock and roll, soul music, and most recently gospel rap. During the Civil Rights
era the melodies of old spirituals and gospel songs were used with new lyrics expressing the
need to overcome Jim Crow segregation.
The Blues
Blues music was the first significant form of secular music created by African American
ex-slaves in the deep South in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Growing out of earlier
black spirituals, work songs, field hollers, and dance music, the blues addressed the social
experiences of the ex-slaves as they struggled to establish themselves in post–Reconstruction
southern culture.
Common themes addressed in early country blues songs were conflicts in love relations,
loneliness, hardship, poverty, and travel. But it would be a mistake to assume that the blues
were exclusively about sorrow—blues celebrated life’s ups and downs, and often reflected a
keen sense of ironic wit and a resolve to struggle on against difficult circumstances.
Most of the early recordings of country blues from the 1920s feature a solo male singer
like Charlie Patton, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Blind Blake, and Son House, accompanying
himself with an acoustic guitar. But blues singers also used banjos, mandolins, fiddles, and

AMERICAN VERNACULAR MUSIC
harmonicas, and often played in small ensembles that provided dance music at country juke
joints. Although blues has been interpreted as a highly individualistic expression because of
the solo voice and first person text, the music was often played in social settings where African
Americans danced, communed, and solidified their group identity.
Early blues lyrics were built around rhymed couplets that eventually became standardized
in a 12-bar (measure) format that featured an AAB structure, with a couplet being repeated
twice, and answered by a second couplet:
I woke up this morning,
I was feeling sad and blue. [A]
I woke up the morning,
I was feeling sad and blue. [A]
My sweet gal she left me,
got no one to sing my troubles to. [B]
The tonality is major, most often built around a 12-bar (measure) progression of the
I (tonic), IV (subdominant), and V (dominant) chords. The melodic line often features bent
and slurred notes, with generous use of the flatted third and seventh tones (known as “blue”
notes) of the diatonic scale. The meter is usually duple (4/4), and tempos may vary from a
slow drag to a fast boogie.
While the first blues were undoubtedly rural in origin, by the 1920s blues music
had made its way to the city. Urban singers like Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith recorded and
popularized sophisticated, jazz-tinged arrangements of blues in the 1920s, and composers like
W. C. Handy incorporated blues forms into popular orchestral pieces like “St. Louis Blues”
and “Memphis Blues.” In the post–World War II years the country blues was electrified and
transformed into rhythm and blues (R&B) by Chicago-based artists Muddy Waters (McKinley
Morganfield), Howlin’ Wolf (Chester Burnett), and Elmore James, and Memphis bluesman B.
B. King. By the mid-1950s southern white singers like Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Buddy
Holly were blending rhythm and blues with elements of country music to create the new pop
genre of rock and roll.
Rock and Roll
Perhaps America’s most influential contribution to the world of popular music has been the
development of rock and roll in the 1950s. Many streams of folk and vernacular music styles,
including blues, spirituals, gospel, ballads, hillbilly music, and early jazz, contributed to the
evolution of rock and roll (R&R). But it was the convergence of African American rhythm
and blues and Anglo American honky-tonk (country) music that led to the emergence of a
distinctive new style that would dominate the field of popular music in post–World War II
America.
Honky-tonk, often referred to as the voice of the downcast, working-class southern
whites, was the dominant form of country music during the 1940s and early 1950s, with
Hank Williams being its most famous practitioner. The music featured the tense, nasal vocal
style associated with the earlier ballad tradition, accompanied by twangy guitars and fiddles,
and lyrics centered on stories of loneliness and broken love relationships. Rhythm and blues
was an urbanized version of older country blues that developed in cities like Memphis and
Chicago during and immediately after the Second World War. Singers like Muddy Waters,
Howlin’ Wolf, and B. B. King shouted and pleaded to their audiences, backed by screaming
electric guitars, amplified harmonicas, and a rhythm sections of drums, bass, and piano. The
music was loud, aggressive, and sensual, with lyrics boasting of sexual conquest or lamenting
failed love.

AMERICAN VERNACULAR MUSIC
The earliest rock-and–roll recordings were made by both white and black singers in the
mid-1950s. The southern white artists like Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee
Lewis, and Bill Haley were dubbed rockabillies because their sounds were rooted in hillbilly and
honky-tonk country styles. Their covers of black rhythm and blues songs like “Rock Around
the Clock” (Haley) and “Good Rockin’ Tonight” (Presley) provided some of the first and most
powerful examples of how white country and black R&B could blend to form the new style of
R&R. From the other side of the racial divide came black R&B singers like Chuck Berry, Little
Richard, and Fats Domino, who cut their R&B sound with smoother vocals (and in Berry’s
case country-influenced guitar licks) to forge a black style of R&R that was close (and at times
indistinguishable) from that of their white counterparts.
Thus, R&R was the inevitable result of an interracial musical stew that had been
simmering in the southern United States for several centuries. Its appearance in the mid1950s was no accident, because this was precisely when independent record companies like
Sun (Memphis) and Chess (Chicago) and innovative radio stations like WDIA (Memphis) were
beginning to bring black vernacular music to a burgeoning baby boomer audience and the
nascent civil rights movements was increasing public awareness of black culture. R&R was a
popular style created in the studio and marketed directly for legions of young, predominantly
white consumers who, thanks to the relative affluence of the post–World War II years, were in
search of new leisure activities.
Musically the earliest R&R recordings were 12-bar blues played in an up-tempo 4/4
meter. Singers, black and white, would sometimes shout and snarl, but were careful to
articulate their words in a style smooth enough for their predominantly white audiences to
comprehend. The music was backed by a strong, insistent rhythm that accented the second
and fourth beat of each measure, creating a sound that was easy to dance to. Rock’s gyrating
singers and sensual dancing led many middle-class Americans, black and white, to condemn
it as an immoral and corrupting force. When Elvis Presley first appeared on the nationally
broadcast TV variety show hosted by Ed Sullivan in 1956, the cameras would only show him
from the waist up in order to avoid his sexy moves that had earned him the title “Elvis the
Pelvis.”
The lyrics to the most successful early R&R songs centered on teenage romance and
adventure, recounting high times cruising in automobiles, dancing at the hop, and falling
in and out of love. The lyrics to sexually suggestive R&B songs covered by R&R singers were
consciously cleaned up so the music would be less offensive to middle-class (black and white)
teens and their parents. Eventually the 12-bar blues form was eclipsed by the verse/chorus
structure organized in 8- or 16-bar stanzas. As in earlier American popular songs, the repeated
chorus was usually based on a simple but engaging melody (often referred to as the “hook”)
that was easy to sing along to.
In the 1960s groups like the Beatles and folk rock singer Bob Dylan transformed R&R
by writing more sophisticated lyrics addressing the complexities of love and sexual relations,
alienation in Western society, and the utopian search for a new world through drugs and
counterculture activities. Both American and British rock groups of the 1960s demonstrated that
popular music could provide serious social commentary that had previously been associated
with the arenas of modern art and literature and the urban folksong movement. Over the past
four decades R&R (often referred to as “rock” to differentiate it from the R&R of the 1950s) has
evolved in many directions (art rock, heavy metal, punk, indie), often cross-pollinating with
related styles like soul, funk, disco, country, reggae, and most recently hip-hop. At times rock
has served as the political voice of angry and alienated youth, and at other times simply as
good-time party and dance music.

AMERICAN VERNACULAR MUSIC
Rap
Rap is poetry recited rhythmically over musical accompaniment. Rap is part of hip-hop culture,
which emerged in the mid-1970s in the Bronx. Graffiti art and break-dance are the other
major elements of hip-hop culture. Rap lyrics display clever use of words and rhymes, verbal
dexterity, and intricate rhythmic patterning. Rap artists take on different roles and speak from
perspectives ranging from comedic to political to dramatic, often narrating stories that reflect
or comment on contemporary urban life. Rap artists may be soloists, or members of a rap
group (or crew), and may recite in call-and-response format. Rap songs are generally in duple
meter at a medium tempo (about 80 to 90 bpm). The musical accompaniment of rap is made
up of one or several continuously repeated short phrases, each phrase combining relatively
simple rhythmic patterns produced by acoustic and/or synthetic percussion instruments.
Other sounds are often added for timbral variety, textural complexity, and melodic/harmonic
interest. A bass line provided by electric bass guitar or synthesizer reinforces the meter and
defines the tonal center.
Old School Rap (1974-1986)
Old school rap was created by DJs (disc jockeys) and one or more MCs (originally Master
of Ceremonies, later Microphone Controller). DJ Kool Herc began this period, providing a
portable sound system and spinning records for dances at outdoor parties and small social
clubs. He noticed that b-boys and b-girls favored dancing to the “break” in a record, the short
section of a song when the band drops out and the percussion continues. Using two copies
of the same record on two turntables, Herc was able to make the break repeat continuously,
creating the “breakbeat” that became the basic musical structure over which the MC spoke or
rapped. DJs Grandmaster Flash, Jazzy Jeff, and Grand Wizard Theodore invented additional
turntable techniques: “blending” different records together, scratching (manually moving the
record back and forth on the turntable to create rhythmic patterns with scratchy timbres),
and mixing in synthetic drum sounds and other effects. An excellent example of turntable
techniques is Flash’s The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel (1981). DJs,
most importantly Afrika Bambaataa, also promoted hip-hop culture through parties and other
events spread by word of mouth and at venues throughout New York City.
At first MCs spoke over records in the Jamaican DJ traditions of toasting (calling out
friends’ names) and boasting (touting the superiority of their own sound system and DJ skills).
Both traditions became central elements of the assertive and competitive spirit of rap and
hip-hop. Rap drew on other African-American sources for some of its important features: the
improvisational verbal skills and call-and-response format of the dozens (an African-American
verbal competition trading witty insults), the rhyming aphorisms of heavyweight champion
Mohammed Ali (“Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee / Your hands can’t hit what your eyes
can’t see”), the songs and vocal stylings of the great soul-funk artist James Brown, and The
Last Poets, whose members spoke or chanted politically charged poems over drumming.
The first MCs to develop extended lyrical forms by rhyming over break beats were
Grandmaster Caz and DJ Hollywood. The interplay of vocal and accompaniment rhythms,
rhyme schemes, and phrasing are the main elements of what is known as flow. Old school
flow is more regular and less syncopated than later styles. Two-line units (couplets) rhyming
at the end of the lines are common during this period, such as, “Pump it up homeboy, just
don’t stop / Chef Boy-ar-dee coolin’ on the pot” (The Beastie Boys). Before rap entered into the
mainstream entertainment industry, portable cassette players provided a cheap and robust
route of dissemination for the music throughout the city. It was the success of Sugar Hill Gang’s
Rapper’s Delight, issued on a small independent label in 1979, that brought rap to national
attention and gave the genre its name. MC Kurtis Blow’s The Breaks (1980), and Rapture by
the pop group Blondie (1981) are also milestones in the early history of rap.

AMERICAN VERNACULAR MUSIC
During the first part of the 1980’s the entertainment industry was slow to realize
rap’s potential and it was left to entrepreneurs like Russell Simmons to popularize rap and
to demonstrate its long-term commercial viability by organizing national hip-hop concert
tours and producing hits by many of the most important artists of the period including L.L.
Cool J, Slick Rick, and Foxy Brown. Independent films like Wild Style, Beat Street, and Style
Wars, introduced hip-hop to a global audience. Rap music videos began to be produced and
all-rap radio stations began broadcasting. Independent labels gained ground and rap was
incorporated into the established recording and distribution industry. By 1986 hip-hop culture
was the most successful popular music in the nation, and rap had developed in three general
directions. Pop rap (or party rap) is light, danceable, and often humorous; it quickly became
a crossover genre, generating national hits by Salt-N-Pepa (the first successful female rap
group), MC Hammer, Vanilla Ice, and many others. Rock rap combines the vocalizations of
rap with the sounds and rhythms of rock bands. The hip-hop trio Run-D.M.C. brought rap
rock to national prominence with King of Rock (the first hip-hop platinum album, 1985). The
Beastie Boys, the first white rap group, appealed to a youth market by smartly combining
humor and rebellion in songs from their 1986 debut album Licensed to Ill. Rock rap set the stage
for other hybrids that flourished in the 1990’s such as Rage Against the Machine and Linkin
Park. Socially conscious rap portrays and comments on the urban ills of poverty, crime, drugs,
and racism. The first example is Melle Mel’s The Message (1982), a series of bleak pictures of
life and death in the ghetto.
New School Rap
New school rap dates from 1986 when Rakim and DJ Eric B introduced a vocal style that was
faster and rhythmically more complex than the simple sing-song couplets of much old school
rap. Writers (rap poets/performers) in the new “effusive” style, notably Nas, employed irregular
poetic meters, asymmetric phrasing, and intricate rhyme schemes, all of which added depth
and complexity to the flow. Much of the new music (and new styles of graffiti and dance)
came from the West Coast, and increasingly from the South and Midwest. Hip-hop culture
was spreading to Europe and Asia as well.
The accompaniment for rap also became more complex and varied. CD’s largely
replaced vinyl records and samplers became commercially available. Producers working
with samplers, programmable drum machines, and synthesizers could, with the push of a
button, mix and modify sounds imported from a virtually unlimited selection, and so largely
replaced DJs as the creators of rap’s musical accompaniment. The New York production team
Bomb Squad and producers RZA and DJ Premier layered multiple samples to create dense,
harmonically rich textures and grating “out of tune” combinations of sounds, while West
Coast producers developed G-funk by using live instrumentation and conventional harmonies
associated with funk music.
The year 1988 was an important turning point for rap. The Source, the first magazine
devoted to rap and hip-hop, appeared that year, and was soon followed by Vibe, XXL and
many others. The first nationally televised rap music videos on Fab Five Freddy’s weekly show
“Yo, MTV Raps!” brought hip-hop images and dances to national attention. That same year
four new rap genres emerged, partly in response to worsened social conditions in black urban
communities: unemployment, drastic cutbacks in education, the crack cocaine epidemic,
proliferation of deadly weapons, gang violence, militaristic police tactics, and Draconian
drug laws all leading to an explosion in the prison population. Political rap was led by writer
KRS-One, with Boogie Down Productions whose album By All Means Necessary explored police
corruption, violence in the hip-hop community, and other controversial topics. On the West
Coast, N.W.A. were cultivating harsh timbres and a raw angry sound in their nihilistic tales of
Los Angeles police violence and gang life in Straight Outta Compton, the first gangsta rap album.
Jazz rap, characterized by use of samples from jazz classics and positive, uplifting lyrics was
introduced by Gang Starr (DJ Premier and MC Guru) and hip-hop group Stetsasonic. Another

AMERICAN VERNACULAR MUSIC
answer to West Coast gangsta rap was New York hardcore rap, led by producer Marley Marl
whose hip-hop collective The Juicy Crew achieved their breakthrough with the posse track The
Symphony. Each genre had important followers. Black nationalism informed the political lyrics
of Public Enemy (led by Chuck D) whose critical and commercial success in 1988-90 proved
the crossover appeal of the new wave of socially conscious rap. Houston-based gangsta rap
group The Geto Boys combined ultra-violent fantasies with cutting social commentary in a
blues-inflected style that came to characterize the “Dirty South” sound in their 1990 debut
album. Jazz rap’s Afrocentric lyrics, fashion, and imagery were shared by important new rap
artists Queen Latifah and Busta Rhymes. Latifah provided a feminist response to the often
misogynist lyrics of male rappers. Wu-Tang Clan’s Enter the Wu-Tang (1993) reclaimed New
York’s reputation for cutting-edge hardcore rap. The minimalist production style on the album
by this Staten Island group was much imitated through the next decade.
In the 1990’s a style called new jack swing originating with producers Teddy Riley and
Puff Daddy integrated R&B into rap and softened rap’s hardcore content while retaining the
edge of black street culture. Notorious B.I.G.’s Juicy from Ready to Die (1994) exemplifies the
laid-back vocal delivery and slower tempo that characterize new jack. Lil’ Kim’s rap on Gettin’
Money captures the “ghettofabulous” image of the new jack rapper in lyrics that mix gats
and six-shooters with Armani and Chanel. The song draws on the iconic American figure
of the Mafia don to create metaphors that celebrate materialism and luxury. Tupac Shakur
and Notorious B.I.G. were the most critically acclaimed and best-selling rappers during the
middle of the 1990’s. Shakur was murdered in 1996 and Notorious B.I.G. in 1997. In the eyes
of many fans, hip-hop had lost its two greatest artists. Three important figures—Eminem,
Jay-Z, and Missy Elliott—led rap into the new millennium.

CHAPTER 7: JAZZ

Characteristic Features
Although most people have heard of jazz, and many recognize it when they hear it, the music
is notoriously hard to categorize. There is simply no single description that can account for
the vast number of styles and genres that have been placed under the jazz “umbrella.” In
fact, some musicians (Duke Ellington, Randy Weston, and others) have avoided using the
term altogether, finding the concept too confining. The term itself (and its variant “jass”) did
not appear until the 1910s, after jazz was already a well-established idiom, and has been
applied to many types of music that most purists would not consider “true” jazz at all, from
the novelty piano rags of Zez Confrey in the 1920s to the instrumental pop music of Kenny
G in the 1980s and 1990s.
A few general comments can be made about the music, however. We know, first of
all, that jazz was a music created primarily by African Americans, and it has deep roots in
traditions that go back as far as the African traditions brought by slaves to America during
the Middle Passage. Related to this are two dualities that virtually all types of jazz share. These
dualities create a vibrant tension in the music that gives jazz much of its power.
Spontaneity vs. planning
Contrary to some popular beliefs, playing jazz is not simply a matter of musicians playing
whatever they feel like. Improvisation—creating new music on the spot—is a vital part of
almost all jazz traditions (see below), but it nearly always takes place in the context of some
larger structure that is planned in advance. This planning can be as simple as deciding who
plays what when (the order of the solos, for example) and as complicated as a completely
written-out arrangement in which most of the musicians are guided by notes printed on the
page. At the very least, musicians will usually decide in advance the tune that will serve as
the basis for their improvisations. Perhaps another way to put this is to think of jazz as a very
“free” music, one that allows players to explore a variety of means of self-expression, but that
at the same time, with freedom comes responsibility. Some type of underlying organization
must be in place or the result is chaos.
Individuality vs. collectivity
From the very beginning of jazz’s history, a premium has always been placed on musicians
who create their own sound—one that is highly personal and instantly recognizable. Whereas
classical musicians will learn the “correct” and “incorrect” ways to play their instruments, for
the jazz musician, there is no “proper” way to make a sound. Though some jazz musicians

49

50

JAZZ
study their instruments in conservatories, many also learn simply by picking up an instrument
and figuring out how to make a sound they like, whether or not it has anything to do with
“acceptable” technique. The great New Orleans clarinetist and soprano saxophonist Sidney
Bechet, for example, developed a totally idiosyncratic technique on his instrument—one that
would make a classical musician cringe—simply by experimentation, but he had an enormous,
rich, and passionate sound that was impossible to duplicate.
Many jazz musicians start their careers by copying another jazz musician outright
(legions of saxophonists, for example, have learned Charlie Parker solos by heart) but at
some point they must learn to develop their own voice or the music becomes stale. In fact,
one of the most damning criticisms a jazz musician can levy at another is to say “he or she
is just a Charlie Parker imitator.” At the same time, all great jazz musicians are also good
listeners, who take pleasure in what the fellow members of their group are trying to “say”
with their instruments, and will often directly respond to ideas that are tossed out as part of
an improvisation. In addition, all members of a jazz group pay close attention to how they
sound as a group; brilliant solos are only as good as the context in which they are heard.
Therefore, in any jazz performance there is always an interesting tension between attempts
to sound like a true individual, as well to be a member of the “collective.”
A few more specific features of the jazz tradition can be outlined, and many are related
to the dualities discussed above.
1. Improvisation. Improvisation of some type is nearly always part of a jazz
performance. Even if musicians are reading notes on a page, they can “improvise”
through the way they attack or color a note, or the rhythmic impulse they bring
to the music. In early jazz musicians often improvised by creating variations on a
given melody. As the tradition developed, it became more common to use a chord
progression as the basis for entirely new melodies. In more recent jazz traditions,
even chords are abandoned and musicians will simply improvise on a scale, a
motive, or even just a tonal center. No matter how they improvise, however, most
musicians have a set of phrases (called “licks”) that lie easily under their fingers and
can be used and reused in a variety of contexts. Charlie Parker, for example, had
many signature “licks” that make his style instantly recognizable. In other words,
jazz musicians do often play musical lines they have played before, but where they
place these lines, and how they play them, is part of the art of improvisation.
2. Instrumentation. Certain instruments have become strongly associated with the
jazz tradition, mainly because of their tone color and ability to fit into an ensemble
or carry a chord structure. And, from its earliest history, there has been a common
division of some of the instruments into a subsection known as the “rhythm section”
that maintains the rhythmic drive and reiterates the chord progression for other
improvising musicians. Ensembles have continued to evolve, however, due to
improvements in microphones and recording technology.
3. The blues. Nearly all jazz has some connection, even if subtle, with the African
American blues tradition, in performance technique, common forms used, and
overall musical “feel.” In fact, there are those who would claim that when the music
loses its connection to the blues, it ceases to be jazz. (This is the claim often used to
prove that Kenny G. is not a jazz musician, even though he plays an instrument
associated with jazz—the soprano saxophone—and improvises. His references to
blues traditions, when they exist at all, are so stylized that they lack any strong
connections to the genuine article.)

JAZZ
4. Performance technique. Largely out of the blues tradition comes the jazz player’s
proclivity for creating “new” sounds on his or her instrument, and using that
instrument in an idiosyncratic way. Often these techniques mirror the use of the
voice in various African American traditions; we know, for example, that the bending
of pitches and growling or rasping sound often used by jazz musicians mirror black
vocal traditions such as the blues, as well as both speech and singing in black
church music. Listen to Louis Armstrong as both a vocalist and a trumpeter, and you
will note there is little difference between the two. In addition, many people have
likened the high pitches (usually out of the normal sound range of an instrument)
associated with certain players such as saxophonist John Coltrane to “screams,”
even though they may reflect excitement or intensity on the part of the performer,
rather than anguish. Such “screams” or “squeaks” are something to be carefully
avoided in Western classical music, but many jazz musicians incorporate them into
their improvisations intentionally.
5. Rhythm. Most jazz performances employ a subtle rhythmic sense that is often
called “swing” or “swing feeling” (note this is a different meaning of the term than
that used below to describe a style and era of jazz). This “swing feeling” is virtually
impossible to define in words (one musician once noted: “if you gotta ask what
swing is, you’ll never know”) but it is very different than the subtle pulse of most
Western art music, the driving beat of popular music, or the dense polyrhythmic
effect of many African traditions. Think of “swing” as a special kind of groove
that is unique to jazz; it creates the subtle forward thrust of the music and often is
what makes you tap your foot. Especially in the 1930s and 1940s, it was the “swing
feeling” mastered by groups such as those led by Count Basie and Benny Goodman
that made audiences leave their seats for the dance floor.
Brief History
The great sweep of jazz’s first century is usually loosely divided into five general periods: (1)
the music’s origins and the emergence of its early masters; (2) the so-called “Swing Era” when
the music was the popular music of the United States (and much of the world as well); (3)
the emergence of bebop in the early 1940s; (4) the avant-garde movement of the late 1950s
and early 1960s; and (5) the “fusion” movement of the 1970s and beyond, in which jazz
absorbed influences from a variety of other musical traditions, including rock. Yet, though
some categorization is necessary to make sense of this music’s unique and fascinating path
through history, such classifications must be used with care, for a newer style does not
necessarily replace an older one. It is possible, in fact, to hear virtually any style of jazz being
played in the 21st century; some musicians look back to the work of earlier performers, while
others continue to push the music into new realms, often absorbing elements of other genres
(including world music and hip-hop) along the way.
I. Early Jazz
Although New Orleans is often touted as “The Birthplace of Jazz,” it is actually impossible to
limit the music’s emergence to a single geographic location. It is clear that vernacular music
traditions that would feed into emerging jazz were developing throughout the country at the
turn of the 19th century. Yet, New Orleans did supply a distinctive style of jazz, and most of the
greatest early practitioners of the music (Louis Armstrong, Sidney Bechet, Ferdinand “Jelly Roll”
Morton, and others) came from this vibrant cultural melting pot, where blues, classical music,
ragtime, church music, and other traditions combined to help create the irresistible, largely
improvised music that took the country by storm in the 1920s. The first recordings of jazz were

51

52

JAZZ
actually made in in New York in 1917 by a white group, The Original Dixieland Jazz Band, an
ensemble made up of Italian Americans from New Orleans, but the true birth of jazz recording
is usually traced to the magnificent recordings made in 1923 by King Oliver and His Creole
Jazz Band, in which Armstrong played second cornet to Oliver’s lead. Joining the migration of
many African Americans to northern cities during the so-called “Great Migration” from the
South in the late teens and early 1920s, Oliver, Armstrong, Morton, and many other musicians
built careers in Chicago, where the music flourished and some of the early masterpieces by
Armstrong and Morton were recorded. Many of these performances include what has become
known as “collective improvisation”—everyone appearing to improvise simultaneously in a
densely polyphonic texture—though we now know that a considerable amount of planning
went into these “improvisations.” Armstrong, however, partly with the encouragement of his
wife Lillian Hardin Armstrong, soon emerged as one of the greatest musicians in the country,
and since his ground-breaking recordings of the mid and late 1920s, jazz has been largely
considered (rightly or wrongly) an art that celebrates the virtuoso soloist.
II. The Swing Era
In the 1930s, New York City became the center of jazz activity, as it has remained to the
present day. In addition, partly because of the huge demand for dance music (the country
was in the midst of the Depression and dance—along with movies—provided escape from
the dismal realities of daily life) and the sizeable venues into which jazz musicians were
booked, jazz bands became larger, often with entire sections of reed and brass instruments.
In addition, the saxophone—considered largely a joke instrument in the 1920s—emerged
as the jazz instrument par excellence (perhaps because of its versatility and similarity to the
human voice). This was the era of the jazz big band, and of groups such as those led by Duke
Ellington, Benny Goodman, and Count Basie. It was also the heyday of the jazz arranger,
who took on the responsibility of laying out specific parts for members of the band (often in
notation) as well as incorporating improvisation, for collective music-making was no longer
feasible in a group of 15 or more musicians. Many of the era’s greatest soloists—saxophonists
Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young, Johnny Hodges and Ben Webster, clarinetists Goodman and
Artie Shaw, trumpeters Roy Eldridge, Red Allen and Cootie Williams (as well as Armstrong,
of course)—played with these big bands. Big band jazz swept the nation, becoming the most
popular type of dance music on the scene, and resulting in the creation of thousands of records.
In addition, radio, which had begun to have an impact on American culture in the 1920s,
exploded into one of the country’s most important media.
III. Bebop
Largely because of financial hardships brought on by World War II, the popularity and
economic feasibility of big band jazz began to wane in the 1940s. But a host of young
musicians had already begun experimenting with new approaches to the music, whether out
of boredom, a sense that African American musicians were being exploited in big bands, or
simply the natural tendency of creative minds to evolve. These developments went largely
undocumented, as they often took place in late-night, informal jam sessions. In addition, in
the early 1940s the Musician’s Union called for a ban on all recordings (in protest over the fact
that musicians were not being recompensed for the airplay of their records), so the brewing
sea change in jazz went largely unrecorded. Yet, by 1945 trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie and alto
saxophonist Charlie “Bird” Parker, along with pianists Thelonious Monk and Bud Powell
and drummers Max Roach and Kenny Clarke, had essentially redefined jazz. Though their
music, which became known as “bebop,” remained firmly rooted in past jazz traditions, they
promoted a return to small-ensemble music, and greatly expanded jazz’s harmonic, rhythmic
and melodic possibilities. They also seemed to suggest that jazz be taken more seriously as
an art form, rather than dance music (though Gillespie once commented, when a listener

JAZZ
complained that he couldn’t dance to bebop, “YOU can’t dance to it!”). This music of 1940s
created the foundation for nearly all modern jazz, and saw an important separation between
the music and social dancing. In addition, the popularity of jazz began to be supplanted by
the emerging idioms of R&B and R&R.
IV. The Avant-Garde
Jazz musicians continued to explore the terrain opened up by Parker and Gillespie and others
during the 1950s. Some created music even farther distant from the popular and accessible
music of the 1930s, while others tried to counteract what they saw as the more “cerebral”
aspects of bebop by playing music more deeply rooted in the blues and gospel. In 1959, a
group led by saxophonist and composer Ornette Coleman (which had been playing to small
and largely hostile audiences on the West Coast) took their inventive styles to New York.
Coleman’s music often did away entirely with usual ideas of improvising on a melody or
chord progression. The work of Coleman and his compatriots is often referred to as “Free Jazz”
(the name of an album Coleman recorded in 1960) but the idiom was not quite as loose as
the name suggests, with often a tonal center or motive providing an important organizing
principle, and close dialogue between the various musicians a crucial feature of the music’s
overall effect. Nevertheless, Coleman’s music, which also revolutionized the roles of the various
instruments in the ensemble, was highly controversial, as was his own edgy, often harsh
instrumental tone and idiosyncratic technique, which some saw as evidence of poor musical
training. Some musicians rejected the new styles entirely, while others—most notably, perhaps,
saxophonist John Coltrane—were strongly influenced by them. Even trumpeter Miles Davis,
though reportedly not a fan of avant-garde jazz, seems to have incorporated some of its traits
in the work of his famous 1960s quintet, which featured saxophonist Wayne Shorter, bassist
Ron Carter, drummer Tony Williams, and pianist Herbie Hancock.
V. Fusion and Jazz-Rock
In 1969 Miles Davis made the highly controversial move of including electric instruments on his
In A Silent Way and Bitches Brew albums, adding as well rhythmic structures aligned with rock
and soul. Many accused Davis of “selling out”—of trying to pander to popular music tastes
of the time—but though Davis was certainly interested in expanding his dwindling audience,
he also heard fascinating possibilities in the work of Sly and the Family Stone, James Brown,
and Jimi Hendrix. Many alumni from Miles’s “electric” groups went on to form fusion bands of
their own—keyboardist Chick Corea with Return to Forever, Wayne Shorter and keyboardist Joe
Zawinul with Weather Report, guitarist John McLaughlin with The Mahavishnu Orchestra, and
Herbie Hancock with a group that produced the hugely popular Headhunters album in 1973.
Though many critics complained that their music “wasn’t jazz,” it did maintain improvisation
and connections with the blues that had always been a part of the jazz tradition.
VI. The 1980s and Beyond
The last three decades have seen the extension of many of jazz history’s streams, as well as
the promotion of jazz as an art worthy of academic discourse. In the 1980s, New Orleans-born
Wynton Marsalis, himself an alumnus of drummer Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers, emerged as
one of the most important spokespersons for the music. Though widely criticized by many as
musically conservative, he has done much for the promotion of jazz worldwide, especially in
his role as director of Lincoln Center’s jazz program. As it always has, the art of jazz continues
to evolve and reflect changing political and economic climates, as well as absorbing other
music that emerges in the now-digital age.

CHAPTER 8: WORLD MUSIC

Selected World Cultures and Repertories
We live in a time of unprecedented access to information about and exposure to cultures from
all over the world. The scholarly study of human customs, languages, religious beliefs, social
institutions, family life, and so on is the subject of anthropology. The scholarly investigation
of the music of different cultures is called ethnomusicology, and encompasses learning about
how, why, where, and when music is created, who performs it, and its distinctive features. The
following sections provide an introduction to the rich, complex, and diverse musical cultures
of four world areas: Africa, India, Indonesia, and the Caribbean.
Africa
Africa is the second largest continent in the world, and home to a tenth of the world’s population
and at least a thousand different indigenous languages. Therefore, it is impossible to describe
a single entity called “African music.” One need only compare the sacred music of the Gnawa
musicians of Morocco with the choral traditions that arose in the townships of South Africa to
see the vast range of musical practices found throughout this huge and complex region.
Especially during the last century, however, scholars have tried to find ways to talk in
general ways about Africa’s rich traditions, while always acknowledging the sometimes very
subtle differences between countries and ethnic groups. Beyond the recognition that African
musicians maintained a vibrant and very distinct art, it has also been noted that this music—
especially that of West Africa, from where the majority of slaves were taken—has played a
significant role in the black cultural Diaspora, with important implications for the music of
Latin America, the Caribbean (see page 59), and a variety of African American traditions (see
American vernacular traditions; Jazz). Thus, understanding a few concepts that are shared
by much African music helps listeners appreciate not only the continent’s music itself but a
host of related traditions. Fortunately, in today’s digital age, recordings of music from virtually
all corners of Africa—both traditional repertoires and styles influenced by Western popular
music—are readily available.
The Sahara Desert, which takes up almost the entire northern third of the continent, is
perhaps the most important dividing line that comes into play when discussing music in Africa.
Countries that lie partly or entirely north of the Sahara (Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia, etc.)
tend to share many qualities with music of the Middle East. The rainforests and grasslands
of Sub-Saharan Africa (Ghana, Cameroon, The Congo, Zambia, etc.) have produced very
different traditions. In addition, distinctions are often made between Sub-Saharan musical
traditions of Western, Eastern, Central, and Southern Africa.

55

WORLD MUSIC

56

As different as African musical traditions may sound from each other, they do tend to
share both cultural and musical elements. However, one must always be cautious when trying
to view these traditions through a Western musical or aesthetic lens.
1. Music and dance. Linguistic scholars have been hard-pressed to find a single word
that means “music” in many African languages. Music and bodily movement are
usually considered part of a single whole, and sound cannot be separated from the
cultural (and often religious) function of musical performances.
2. In many African cultures, music and dance are considered communal activities; the
Western idea of sitting silently while a performance is taking place is an anathema
to these traditions. Many musical techniques that are shared by African musics—
particularly the idea of “call and response,” where a soloist or group of performers
will engage in short exchanges with other performers—seem to have arisen from
this communal attitude toward music-making.
3. Oral traditions. Nearly all African traditions have been passed down orally, and
their study by Western scholars has often involved the transcription of performances
into Western musical notation, which often proves woefully inadequate for the job.
The influx of Christian choral music, especially in the southern regions of Africa,
has resulted in music somewhat more easily notatable, and some African musicians
do now use the familiar five-line system to capture their art.
4. In many African traditions, rhythm—the way music moves through time—seems
to be privileged over melody and harmony. Many African performances are highly
polyphonic and made up of several layers of interlocking rhythmic ostinatos,
which are combined to create an overall effect suitable for the religious or cultural
ceremony for which the sounds are being produced.
5. Instruments. The variety of instruments found throughout Africa is astounding.
Perhaps most impressive is the range of percussion instruments (both idiophones
and membranophones) that are often combined with distinctive uses of the human
voice. In listening to performances of African music, those of us immersed in the
Western musical tradition may be initially drawn to the vocal line as the most
prominent feature, yet it may just be one element of a larger, complex musical
texture.
India
North Indian Classical Music (Hindustani sangita)
Music from the Indian subcontinent is one of the non-Western repertories that has fascinated
Western musicians and audiences in recent decades. Improvisation is central to the
performance of North Indian classical music (Hindustani music) and is mastered only after
years of study with a guru. The skeletal elements from which the improvisation springs are the
raga, an ascending and descending pattern of melodic pitches, and the tala, the organization
of rhythm within a recurring cycle of beats. Rather than the 12-semitone octave of Western
classical music, Indian music divides the octave into 22 parts. Although only some of those
22 pitches are used in a particular raga, the complexity and subtlety of Indian melody is
attributable in part to this relatively large vocabulary of pitch material. With respect to
temporal organization, Indian music organizes spans of time into cycles of beats, somewhat
comparable to the Western concept of meter. But whereas Western composers have worked
predominantly in a framework of time spans divided into repeated cycles of two, three, or four
beats, the time span of a tala is comprised of units of variable length, for example, a 14-beat

WORLD MUSIC
tala of four plus three plus four plus three beats. A tala may also be of enormous duration in
comparison with a Western measure, which rarely exceeds a few seconds in length.
There are hundreds of talas and thousands of ragas. Each raga has specific extra-musical
associations such as a color, mood, season, and time of day. These associations shape the
performer’s approach to and the audience’s experience of an improvisation, which can last
from a few minutes to several hours. Indian music also has an important spiritual dimension
and its history is intimately connected to religious beliefs and practices. As stated by the great
sitarist Ravi Shankar, “We view music as a kind of spiritual discipline that raises one’s inner
being to divine peacefulness and bliss. The highest aim of our music is to reveal the essence
of the universe it reflects….Through music, one can reach God.”
The typical texture in Indian music consists of three functionally distinct parts: (1)
a drone, the main pitches of the raga played as a background throughout a composition;
(2) rhythmic improvisations performed on a pair of drums; and (3) melodic improvisations
executed by a singer or on a melody instrument. One of the most common melody instruments
is the sitar, a plucked string instrument with a long neck and a gourd at each end, six or
seven plucked strings, and nine to thirteen others that resonate sympathetically. The melody
instrument or voice is traditionally partnered by a pair of tablas, two hand drums tuned to the
main tones of the pitch pattern upon which the sitar melody is based. The drone instrument is
often a tambura, a plucked string instrument with four or five strings each tuned to one tone
of the basic scale and plucked to produce a continuous, unvarying drone accompaniment.
A raga performance traditionally opens with the alap, a rhapsodic, rhythmically
free introductory section in which the melody instrument is accompanied only by the
drone. Microtonal ornaments and slides from tone to tone are typical elements of a melodic
improvisation. The entrance of the drums marks the second phase of the performance in which
a short composed melodic phrase, the gat, recurs between longer sections of improvisation.
Ever more rapid notes moving through extreme melodic registers in conjunction with an
increasingly accelerated interchange of ideas between melody and drums produces a gradual
intensification as the performance progresses to its conclusion.
South Indian Classical Music (Karnataka sangita)
South Indian classical music (Karnatic or Carnatic music) evolved from ancient Hindu traditions
and is relatively free of the Arabic and Islamic influences that contribute to Hindustani music.
Karnatic music is primarily vocal and the texts devotional in nature (often in Sanskrit). The
instrumental music consists largely of performances of vocal compositions with a melody
instrument replacing the voice and staying within a limited vocal range. It is important to
note that the vocal style is so advanced that it seems almost instrumental in nature. One
could say in Karnatic music that vocal and instrumental styles merge into one. Works in this
tradition are normally composed, as opposed to the improvised Hindustani tradition, with
new compositions being written every day. Four Karnatic composers of great importance are
Purandara Dasa (1494–1564), Shayama Shastri (1762–1827), Tyagaraja (ca.1767–1848), and
Muttusvami Dikshitar (1775–1835).
Karnatic music uses the same system of raga (scale) and tala (meter) as found in the
north, but the systems for classifying raga and tala are more highly developed and consistent,
thanks to a long period of growth with a minimum of influence from the outside.
Just as Hindustani instrumental music often follows the formal outline of an alap
(slow meditative section exploring the raga), followed by a gat (faster section with percussion
accompaniment), many Karnatic compositions are in the form Pallavi: (Opening Section),
Anupallavi: (Middle Section), Charanam: (Concluding Section) with an abbreviated pallavi
serving as a refrain between subsequent sections and concluding the piece. Towards the end
of the composition an improvised section, called the svara kalpana, is often inserted where the

57

WORLD MUSIC

58

vocalist expands on the pitches in the raga while singing with “sa re ga ma” syllables instead
of the text. This improvised singing may alternate with a melody instrument, such as a violin,
imitating the singer.
Two Western instruments have become a standard part of Karnatic music, the
aforementioned violin for melodic use and the hand-pumped harmonium for playing the
sustained drone pitches. A present-day concert ensemble might include a lead vocalist,
a violin, a mridangam (a two-headed drum functioning as the tabla does in Hindustani
music), a ghatam (a large mud pot reinforcing the tala) and one or two tambura (large string
instruments performing the drone pitches).
Indonesia
The Republic of Indonesia consists of a string of about 6,000 islands, including Java, Sumatra,
New Guinea, and Bali, that lie between the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The main instrumental
ensemble of Indonesia is the gamelan, a percussion ensemble of up to 80 musicians that
accompanies ceremonial plays, religious rituals, community events, and dancing in Indonesia.
All gamelan traditions are rooted in Hindu-Buddhism, and gamelan performance is deeply
connected with rituals. Gamelan instruments can be made of wood and bamboo, but the
ensemble’s distinctive sound derives from the preponderance of instruments made of bronze—
large tuned gongs, kettles of various sizes, and bars of different lengths in a xylophone-like
arrangement. The instruments are themselves charged with charismatic power and are often
intricately carved and brilliantly painted with figures and designs that replicate elements of
the universe. In Bali, gamelans belong to village communities, in Java also to families and
the state.
Each gamelan composition is based on one fixed and unique melody, in Java balungan,
in Bali pokok. There are thousands of these melodies, which have been passed on mainly
through oral transmission. The melodic material is derived from numerous ways of dividing
the octave into five or seven pitches, thereby producing a variety of scales. In the course of
a performance, the performers execute highly complex variations, with the tempo of the
ensemble controlled by drummers playing interlocking rhythmic patterns. The resulting layers
of related melodies, which coincide at points punctuated by the sound of huge gongs, mirror
the overlapping and interweaving of cosmological forces.
China
The People’s Republic of China occupies a vast land area and is the world’s most populous
nation. It is also one of the earliest centers of civilization, as evidenced by religious and
philosophical texts, novels and poetry, scientific literature, and musical instruments that survive
from the early dynastic era (beginning in 1122 BC). In the sixth century BC Confucius wrote
about the value of music to man in achieving the goals of living in harmony with nature and
maintaining a well regulated society. Although Chinese systems of notation can be dated
back to the fourth century BC, most Chinese music has been passed on orally.
Over the course of China’s long history, different districts evolved distinctive linguistic
dialects and cultural practices, including those associated with music. One tradition that is
common throughout China is that all theater is musical and all regions maintain companies
of singers and instrumentalists for theatrical performances. Peking Opera is the form of
Chinese musical drama best known in the West and has enjoyed great popularity both at
court and among common people in China. The stories, of which there are over 1,000, deal
mainly with social and romantic relationships and military exploits. Staging is without sets
and props and, until the 1920s, all roles were sung by men and boys.

WORLD MUSIC
Notable features of Peking Opera are its repertory of subtle and highly stylized physical
movements and gestures and a tight, nasal vocal timbre. The singers are accompanied by
an orchestra consisting of strings, winds, and percussion which, in the Chinese system, are
classified according to the materials from which they are made – metal, stone, earth/clay,
skin, silk, wood, gourd, and bamboo. Among China’s important instruments are the erhu
and ching-hu, both bowed strings; the cheng and ch’in, plucked strings; the lute-like pipa; the
ti-tzu, a transverse flute made of bamboo; the double-reed so-na; and a wide array of gongs,
chimes, bells, drums, cymbals, and clappers. The “conductor” of a Peking Opera orchestra is
one of the percussionists, who sets the beat for the ensemble.
The music of Peking Opera exemplifies three characteristic features: 1) pentatonic scale,
in which the octave is divided into five steps, producing a scale whose intervallic distances
approximate the whole step and step-and-a-half of the Western system; 2) monophonic
texture, one melody performed by both singer and instrumentalists, although in different
octaves; 3) heterophony, a performance practice whereby the players spontaneously and
simultaneously introduce variants of the melody, sometimes producing brief moments of
improvised polyphony.
That these features are also found in the music of Japan and Korea is indicative of
China’s contact with other cultures of Asia, sometimes through military conquest. China
also maintained naval and overland caravan routes for trading with Eastern Europe, the
Middle East, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and the countries along the Adriatic
and Mediterranean. A 19th century German geographer dubbed this network the Silk Road.
European influence on Chinese music was especially strong during the Republic of China
period, 1912-1949, when Chinese musicians went to Europe to study, Western-style orchestras
were established, Western notation was adopted, and Western harmonies were added to
traditional Chinese folk music.
Following the establishment in 1949 of the People’s Republic of China under Chairman
Mao Zedong, the role of music was to promote the ideology of China’s communist party. The
spheres of musical activity were particularly restricted during the Cultural Revolution, 19661976, when China entered an isolationist period. The evils of capitalism and the bourgeois
and decadent values of Western culture were denounced, and intellectuals and members of
professional classes were sent to the country to be “re-educated.” Since the 1980s, the revival
of traditional Chinese musical practices and repertories, and renewed contact between the
musicians of China and the rest of the world are important manifestations of the modern
phenomenon of globalization and cross-cultural exchange.
The Caribbean
Stretching from Cuba, located only 90 miles south of Florida, east and south to Trinidad,
just off the coast of South America, the Caribbean is one of the most culturally diverse and
musically rich regions of the world. Spanish conquest and settlement in the 17th century
wiped out most of the native Carib people. English, French, and Dutch settlement followed
and sugar production became the primary industry of the area. In order to operate the laborintensive sugar plantations, millions of African slaves were imported during the 17th, 18th,
and early 19th centuries. When slavery was abolished, large numbers of East Indians came
to English-speaking islands to work the sugar plantations. Today each island has its own mix
of European, African, and Asian populations. Haiti, for example, is predominantly African,
while Puerto Rico boasts a mix of African and Spanish people, and Trinidad is nearly evenly
split between citizens of African and East Indian ancestry. Reflecting this diverse population,
the islands have developed a wide range of distinctive linguistic, religious, culinary, and
musical traditions.

WORLD MUSIC
The concept of creolization is essential to understand the music and culture of the
Caribbean. Creolization refers to the development of a distinctive new cultural form resulting
from contact between two or more different cultures. Throughout the Caribbean, the blending
of African and European (and occasionally East Indian) cultures has led to the emergence of
new forms of language, religion, food, and of course music. With regard to music, African
concepts of polyrhythm, call-and-response singing, repetition and subtle variation, along
with use of percussion instruments (particularly skin drums) have blended with European
melodies, harmonic accompaniment, verse/chorus song structure, and use of string and brass
instruments. The diversity of Caribbean folk musical styles may be organized on a stylistic
continuum, with neo-African drumming and ritual song/chant on one end, and European
sounding hymn singing, military marches, social dance music, and lyrical ballads on the
other. In between lie an array of truly mixed, creolized song/dance forms including the son
of Cuba, the plena of Puerto Rico, the meringue of the Dominican, the mento of Jamaica, and
the calypso of Trinidad.
During the 20th century independence, urbanization, and emigration, along with
a decline in the sugar industry and the rise of tourism, have brought sweeping changes to
the Caribbean cultural landscape. The rise of mass media and international travel resulted
in further mixing of Caribbean music with American and African popular styles, resulting
in modern pop dance forms such as the Cuban/Puerto Rican/NYC salsa, Trinidadian socca,
Jamaican reggae, Haitian konpa, and zouk from Martanique and Guadeloupe. Many of these
styles have become popular in urban centers outside of the Caribbean with large populations
of Island immigrants such as New York, Miami, and London. Today New York City’s dance and
concert halls feature the top salsa, meringue, reggae, konpa, and socca stars, and Brooklyn’s
Labor Day West Indian Carnival has grown into the largest ethnic outdoor festival in the
United States.
Jibaro, Bomba, and Plena Music of Puerto Rico
There are three primary folk music genres indigenous to the Island of Puerto Rico. These
are the Spanish-derived jibaro music associated with the small farms and interior mountain
communities, and the bomba and plena styles identified with the coastal towns with larger
African populations.
Because Puerto Rico’s agricultural economy was centered in coffee and tobacco and
not the labor-intensive sugar industry that dominated most of the Caribbean, fewer African
slaves were imported and the influence of Spanish culture remained strong. The jibaros, the
Spanish descendents who worked the interior farms, developed their own song and dance
forms based heavily on Spanish traditions. Elite dance music and poetry, imported from
Europe by the wealthy landowners, or hacendados, along with Spanish folk traditions, found
their way into the jibaros repertoires. The seis is song set in 10-line verse form with lyrics
dealing with idealized love, motherhood, the suffering of the jibaro farmer, and the beauty
of the Puerto Rican countryside. Another song form, the aguinaldo, is associated specifically
with the Christmas season. The seis and aguiandlo may be sung in a slow, ballad style, or
played in a livelier tempo when used to accompany dancing at jibaro fiestas. A typical jibaro
ensemble consists of guitar, cuatro (a guitar with five doubled strings), maracas, and guiro
scraper, backing a trovador (singer/poet) who sings stock verses and improvises decimas (10line text stanzas) on the spot. Jibaro singing is characterized by a high, tense, dramatic vocal
delivery.
In coastal towns like Ponce, where African slaves were brought to work the sugar
plantations, bomba and plena music developed. Bomba, the most African-influenced Puerto
Rican folk style, features exuberant call-and-response singing between a leader and a chorus,
interlocking drum patterns, and intense drummer/dance interaction (the latter responds to

WORLD MUSIC
the lead drummer’s improvised rhythms). A typical bomba ensemble consists of a pair of
sticks known as fúa or cua that provide a steady ground beat when struck on a hard surface;
a maraca; and two or more barrel-shaped drums. The lyrics to bomba songs usually refer to
everyday work and social events.
Plena is a creolized folk song that combines African-derived call (leader) and response
(chorus) singing, drumming, and dance with European-derived melodies and harmonies. A
traditional plena ensemble includes several handheld frame drums called panderetas (similar
to a tambourine but without the metal jingles), the güiro (scraped gourd), and one or more
melodic instruments such as the accordion, harmonica, or cuatro. Often referred to as “el
periodico cantado” (the sung newspaper), plena songs relate current and historical events of
community life. In recent years the plena ensembles have incorporated horns, keyboards,
electric bass, and extended percussion to produce a more modern dance sound.
Carnival Music from Trinidad and Brooklyn
Trinidad, the small Caribbean island nation located just off the coast of Venezuela, is home to
one of the world’s largest carnivals. New World urban carnivals have their immediate roots
in the pre-Lenten celebrations of medieval and Renaissance Europe. On such occasions large
numbers of the people took to the streets to frolic and engage in satirical performances that
often challenged social hierarchy and everyday order. When Euro-Catholic carnival practices
were transplanted to the New World by French, Spanish, and Portuguese settlers, they mixed
and mingled with the traditions of the African slaves and their descendants, resulting in the
emergence of spectacular creolized celebrations in cities such as Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Port of
Spain, Trinidad; and New Orleans. Increasingly these festivities took on an African flavor, as
African masking traditions and neo-African music styles featuring call-and-response singing,
improvisation, and syncopated dance rhythms became hallmarks of urban carnival.
The development of carnival in Port of Spain, Trinidad, demonstrates this process. The
original 18th-century pre-Lenten street processions of the French planters were eventually taken
over by the island’s African population who blended their own emancipation celebrations into the
European festivities. By the mid-19th century they had established a large-scale annual celebration
in the days leading up to Ash Wednesday. Street rituals evolved around groups of masqueraders
who paraded and danced to percussion ensembles and a chantwell who led the revelers in rowdy
call-and-response singing that became an important source of modern-day calypso song. By the
early post–World War II years ensembles of steel pan players (steelbands) became the main source
of music for the street processions of carnival masqueraders (mas bands).
By the turn of the 20th century the noisy call-and-response street carnival singing
developed into calypso songs characterized by lyrical melodies, bouncy syncopated rhythms,
and a solo verse/chorus refrain structure. Drums and bamboo percussion instruments were
replaced by string (usually guitar) and horn accompaniments. Calypso songs offered witty and
satirical commentary on a wide range of social issues, current events, and lewd scandals, often
mocking the pretensions of the upper classes. In the 1930s a number of calysponians boasting
titles like Lord Invader, the Duke of Iron, Houdini, and Roaring Lion traveled to New York to
record and perform. Eventually they would foment a calypso craze in the United States that
culminated with Harry Belafonte’s 1957 hit, “Day-O.” By the late 1970s Trinidadian calypso
singers were incorporating elements of American disco and soul music into their sound to
forge the new style of soca (soul/calypso), which featured a pounding bass line, heavy drums,
and riffing synthesizers. Soca lyrics, often based around simple choruses exhorting listeners to
party and dance, generally lacked the sophisticated wit and sardonic commentary associated
with earlier calypso songs.
The second important Trinidadian carnival tradition, steel pan music, grew out of 19th
and early 20th century drum and bamboo percussion ensembles that accompanied singers and

61

WORLD MUSIC

62

costumed revelers in carnival street processions. Sometime in the mid-1930s tamboo bamboo
percussion ensembles began experimenting with paint and trash cans, automobile brake
drums, and other metal objects. Players eventually discovered that different pitches could be
achieved by pounding the bottoms of metal containers into different shapes and striking them
with sticks. Following WW II, the first true steel drums were forged by pan tuners (builders)
who cut oil drums into different sizes to produce a wider tonal range. More sophisticated
techniques were developed for grooving notes, leading to pans capable of producing fully
chromatic scales and conventional Western harmonies. By the 1950s steel pan orchestras
were playing complex arrangements of calypsos as well as Latin dance music, American pop
songs, and European classical pieces.
Steel orchestras grew in size, and today may number as many as 100 performers
playing a range of pans divided into six or seven sections. The high-range tenor pans usually
play the primary melodic line while the double tenors and double seconds double the
melody or contribute second melodies. The mid-range cello and guitar pans provide chordal
accompaniment. Full-sized, fifty-five gallon drums, arranged in six, nine, or twelve drum
configurations, maintain a moving bass line. A trap drum set, one or more conga drums, an
iron (automobile brake drum struck with a metallic stick), and additional hand percussion
provide a dense rhythmic accompaniment for dancing.
Brooklyn’s West Indian Carnival, based on the Trinidad model, is the most recent urban
carnival to rise to prominence. Originally staged in Harlem on Labor Day (in deference to
NYC’s climate that would not allow for a large-scale outdoor festivities during the traditional
mid-winter, pre-Lenten carnival season), West Indian Carnival moved to central Brooklyn’s
Eastern Parkway in the late 1960s where large numbers of West Indians were settling following
the 1965 immigration reforms. Mas bands of fancy costumed carnival-goers dance to steel
bands and sound trucks pumping out contemporary calypso and soca hits as well Jamaican
reggae, Haitian konpa, and the latest pop music offerings from Grenada, Barbados, and
Panama. By the 1990s Brooklyn Carnival had evolved into the largest ethnic festival in the
United States, drawing an estimated two million people. The festivities stretch over the entire
Labor Day weekend with a series of nightly concerts headlined by international calypso and
reggae stars, fancy costume competitions, and a panorama contest featuring the borough’s
top steel bands.
South America
Until fairly recently, there had been a tendency to see the cultural traditions of the massive
South American continent as monolithic. However, in the 1960s scholars began to unravel
the area’s rich tapestry of musical cultures and practices, and with the increase in recordings,
the public is better able to appreciate the variety of musical traditions found here.
As many as 117 languages are spoken in the continent, in perhaps 2000 different
dialects. Until the 16th century, South America boasted some of the world’s most sophisticated
cultures (the most famous being, perhaps, the Incas of the Andean regions). In the 1530s, the
Spanish conquistadors arrived, followed by the Portuguese. They brought with them elements
of European culture, as well as Catholicism, but a variety of diseases as well that devastated
parts of the indigenous population.
Some indigenous traditions have remained nearly untouched until quite recently,
because of the geographical remoteness of the cultures that created them (vast areas of
rainforest and mountain terrain had remained unexplored until quite recently). But for the most
part, South American music is a fascinating mix of Spanish, Portuguese, and indigenous art
forms, as well as the music of Africans who were brought to the continent as slaves. Repertories
can be as diverse as the romanzas found throughout South America (historically linked to

WORLD MUSIC
folk songs of the Spanish renaissance) and the music of the Brazilian capoeira tradition, an
art form strongly influenced by African music that is accompanied by physical movements
resembling martial arts.
Argentina and Tango
In music of both its indigenous peoples and that of the Spanish conquistadors of the 16th
century, as well as more recent immigrants, Argentina boasts a rich and varied heritage of
art, folk, and popular traditions. Perhaps the musical genre most closely associated with this
diverse country of nearly forty million is the tango. In fact, few artistic expressions are so
closely associated with their country of origin as the tango is with Argentina, though variations
of this popular dance arose in many Latin American countries. Perhaps no other proof is
necessary than the fact that the climactic song “Don’t Cry For Me, Argentina,” from Andrew
Lloyd Webber’s Evita, is cast in a tango style.
As both a seductive dance and a musical genre, tango had lowly origins in the brothels
of Buenos Aires, Argentina’s capital city, where it took shape during the last three decades of
the 19th century, drawing on a variety of earlier Spanish and Creole forms. However, by the
turn of the century, the dance and its music had begun to be accepted by the urban middle
class, and been exported to the world. In the early 1910s, tango, perhaps because of its aura
of the risqué (in its most popular form it is a couples dance, with the dancers tightly clasped
together, and the male performing stylized moves that suggest erotic power and conquest)
created a sensation in Europe and the United States. As a result, any music with the tango’s
characteristic “habanera” rhythm (think of the title character’s famous aria in Bizet’s opera
Carmen) began to be called a “tango,” though true Argentinean tango continued to develop
as a distinctive art form.
The earliest tango ensembles were made up simply of violin, flute and guitar, though
the guitar was occasionally replaced by an accordion. The turn of the century saw the
incorporation of the bandoneón, a special type of 38-key accordion, as well as the piano. Later
groups brought in additional string instruments, including the double bass. By the time of
tango’s “Golden Age” in the 1940s, some ensembles had grown to the size of small orchestras,
with full string sections, several bandoneónes, and often vocalists.
By the late 1950s and early 1960s, the popularity of tango in its native Argentina had
been largely eclipsed by newer forms of popular and folk music. But with the rise in popularity
of composer and bandoneón virtuoso Astor Piazzolla (1921-1992) and his “New Tango” (see
Musician Biographies), tango reached a new international audience, culminating in the wildly
successful world tour of the Tango Argentino show, a stage extravaganza created in the early
1980s by Claudio Segovia and Hector Orezzoli that eventually made its way to Broadway.
Jewish Klezmer Music
Klezmer music is a term used to designate the Yiddish dance music of Ashkenazi Jews that
dates back to the Middle Ages when it developed in Eastern Europe before eventually migrating
to the United States. The Yiddish term “klezmer” comes from two Hebrew words, klei-zemer,
which translates as “vessel of melody.”
Early Klzemer bands played for a variety of social occasions including weddings, holiday
celebrations, and rite of passage ceremonies throughout European Jewish communities. Up
through the 18th century fiddles, cellos, string basses, flutes, drums, and tsimbls (hammered
dulcimers) were the primary instruments. By the early 19th century the clarinet became the
primary lead melodic instrument, and brass instruments including the trumpet, trombone,
and tuba were added to the ensembles. Repertories were wide, including Yiddish melodies,
Hassidim chants and dances tunes, non-Jewish dance forms such as the polka, light classical
pieces, and salon dances such as the waltz.

63

64

WORLD MUSIC

Klzemer tunes are most often built around 8 or 16 bar, AB or ABC sections that are
repeated with small variations. Melodic lines tend to be modal with complex ornamentations
resulting from the generous use of trills, slurs, slides, and triplets. The clarinet is known for its
particularly wild, shrill sounds (the dramatic clarinet glissando that opens George Gershwin’s
Rhapsody in Blue is thought to be influenced by klezmer styling). Harmonic accompaniments
are characteristically built around minor chords; often a piece will feature dramatic shifts
between minor and major modalities. Most klezmer dance pieces have a strong rhythmic
pulse stressing the downbeat of a 2/4 or 4/4 meter producing a bouncy feel. Occasionally
irregular meters such as 3/8 or 9/8 are used. Klezmer tunes sometimes begin with a taxim,
or free meter modal improvisation, usually played on the clarinet.
Social and political unrest in Russia, Poland, and other regions of Eastern Europe
fostered the immigration of millions of Yiddish-speaking, Ashkenazi Jews to America in the
late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, most of whom settled in New York City. Klezmer
music became popular at Jewish-American weddings, holiday celebrations and social club
dances, and by the 1920s was being recorded by Jewish musicians like virtuoso clarinetist
Dave Tarras. Born in the Ukraine into a family of musicians, Tarras immigrated to New
York in 1922 and became the leading klezmer clarinetist of his generation. In the tradition
of the old world klezmer bands, early New York Jewish ensembles consisted of reeds, brass,
and string instruments, often backed by accordion or piano and drum accompaniment. As
Jewish musicians came under the influence of American tin pan alley and early jazz of the
1920s and 1930s they created innovative hybrids like Yiddish swing and the popular Yiddish
theater songs.
Interest in traditional Asheknazi culture in general and klezmer music in particular
waned during the Holocaust, World War Two, and the early post-War years. The 1970s saw
a revival of activity by a new generation of Jewish musicians bent on rediscovering the roots
of their Ashekanazi ancestors. Not surprisingly, New York was the center of the action, and
at the forefront of the revival was Brooklyn-born clarinet virtuoso Andy Statman (b. 1950).
A protégé of Dave Tarras, Statman spent years mastering the traditional klezmer style and
repertoire. His eclectic tastes have led him to incorporate elements of bluegrass, jazz, rock,
Middle Eastern music, and Western classical music into his innovative sound. Today klezmer
has become a true world music, blending the traditional Asheknazi tunes of Eastern Europe
with the sounds of modern classical, jazz, rock, soul, rap, and various North African and
Mid-Eastern musics.

APPENDIX 1: MUSICIAN BIOGRAPHIES

Anderson, Laurie (b. 1947)
Born in Chicago, performance artist Laurie Anderson studied both art and the violin until age
16 when she decided to stop playing the instrument in order to focus on art and literature.
Her passion for reading and art led her to Barnard College where she studied art history.
After graduation she studied with Carl Andre and Sol LeWitt at the School of Visual Arts and
completed an M.F.A. in sculpture from Columbia University in 1972. Music became a part of
Anderson’s work in her 1973 performance Automotive (a concert for “nice cars in harmony”)
and she returned to the violin (although in an unconventional way) in 1975 when she invented
the tape bow violin by replacing the violin strings with a tape recorder playback head and
the bow hair with a prerecorded piece of magnetic tape. Sound was produced as she dragged
the magnetic tape bow back and forth over the playback head.
Anderson achieved popular success in 1981, and a recording contract with Warner
Brothers Records, when her song O Superman (from Part 2 of her seven hour theater piece
United States) was released as a single and climbed to number 2 on the British pop charts. An
unlikely popular hit with a duration of over eight minutes, it is a typical Anderson composition
in that it tells a story interjected with clichés (Pay as you go), slogans (Neither snow nor rain
nor gloom of night…), and humorous asides (Hi Mom!). A political work, Anderson wrote
the piece as a reaction to Iran-Contra, but it took on new meaning for her when she sang the
lines “Here come the planes. They’re American planes. Made in America.” at Town Hall in New
York City on September 19, 2001, ten days after the destruction of the World Trade Center.
Armstrong, Louis (1901–1971)
Cornetist, trumpeter, singer, and entertainer. An early nickname was “Dipper” (or
“Dippermouth”) and somewhat later (and more famously) “Satchelmouth” or “Satchmo,”
both references not just to physical characteristics but to the hugeness of his sound. Armstrong
was one of the most important figures in the history of jazz. He was born in perhaps the worst
slum of New Orleans, but surrounded from an early age by the rich and varied musical culture
of that unique city. As a youngster he sang as part of a vocal quartet, and his first instrument
was reportedly a tin horn given him by a Jewish family he worked for.
After being arrested in 1912 for firing a pistol on New Year’s Eve, he was sent to the
Home for Colored Waifs, where he began playing the cornet and had his first musical training.
During his later teen years, Armstrong began playing with trombonist Kid Ory’s Jazz Band,
and in 1922 moved to Chicago where he joined the band of King Oliver, with whom he played
second cornet. In 1924 he traveled to New York to play with Fletcher Henderson’s band, a stint
that had a startling impact on the large-ensemble jazz played in that city. In 1925, back in
Chicago, he began a series of recordings under his own name that would become classics of
early jazz (“Hotter Than That,” “West End Blues,” “Weather Bird,” and many others). By the
end of the Twenties he had emerged as perhaps the greatest trumpeter in jazz, and is largely
credited for jazz’s evolution from a collective style to a soloist’s art. In 1929 he moved to New
York, and in the next decade became an international superstar.
His appearance in almost 20 films and State Department-sponsored tours in the 1950s
and 1960s brought jazz to international audiences and earned him the nickname “Ambassador
Satch.” Though he always considered himself first and foremost an entertainer, his solo trumpet
playing is remarkable for its brilliance and virtuosity, hot tone, and fluid rhythmic sense.

MUSICIAN BIOGRAPHIES
The rough, gravelly quality of his voice (in many ways similar to his trumpet technique) is
instantly recognizable and his dazzling vocal improvisations using nonsense syllables, called
“scatting,” became widely imitated. Among his hits as a singer toward the end of his career
were “What a Wonderful World” (featured in the movie Good Morning Vietnam), “Mac the
Knife,” and especially “Hello, Dolly,” the immense popularity of which took him utterly by
surprise (the song knocked the Beatles out of first place on the pop charts in 1964). Armstrong’s
generosity was legendary, and in later years he could often be found on the steps of his home
in Corona, Queens (now a museum), playing his horn with neighborhood kids.
Bach, Johann Sebastian (1685–1750)
Johann Sebastian Bach was the most illustrious member of a musical dynasty in which his
ancestors for several generations had been musicians and three of his own 20 children were
important composers and performers. Bach began his professional career at 18 when he
was appointed to the court orchestra at Weimar in Germany. Over the next 20 years he held
positions as organist, composer, and musical director in other north German cities, finally
accepting the post as head of music at one of the major churches in Leipzig, where he remained
until his death.
In some respects Bach was a provincial composer who spent his entire life in towns and
moderate-size cities of northern Germany at a time when the great musical centers of Europe
were London, Paris, Rome, Naples, and Venice. Moreover, although his creative output was
vast, very few of his works were published during his lifetime. But while he was relatively
unknown, he was both aware of and profoundly interested in the music of his predecessors
and contemporaries. As a young man he walked 200 miles to experience at first hand the
music of the aging organist and composer Dietrich Buxtehude. His justification for the threemonth absence from his job was that he needed to “comprehend one thing and another about
his art.” A major reason for his move to Leipzig in 1723 was the cultural and educational
opportunities available to himself and his family in a university city. Bach’s large library
of scores and theoretical writings also attests to the wide range of his musical interests, from
Italian keyboard collections of the early Baroque to works by such contemporaries as the
Frenchman Francois Couperin and the Italian Antonio Vivaldi. He also owned many writings
on theological subjects, including the complete works of Martin Luther.
The relatively limited reputation Bach achieved during his lifetime was primarily as
an organ virtuoso. In one contemporary account his playing on the pedals, for which he was
especially renowned, was described as follows:
Bach deserves to be called the miracle of Leipzig as far as music is concerned. For if it pleases
him, he can by the use of his feet alone (while his fingers do either nothing or something else)
achieve such an admirable, lively, and rapid concord of sounds on the church organ that others
would seem unable to imitate with their fingers. He ran over the pedals as if his feet had wings,
making the organ resound with a fullness of sound that penetrated the ears of those present like
a thunderbolt. Frederick, Prince of Cassel admired him with such astonishment that he drew a
precious ring from his finger and gave it to Bach as soon as the sounds had died away. If Bach
earned such a gift for the agility of his feet, what, I ask, would the Prince have given him if he
had called his hands into service as well?

Unfortunately, many of Bach’s compositions that were preserved only in manuscript
were lost in the years after his death. Nevertheless, the scholarly edition of his known surviving
works fills almost 50 large volumes and a project to record them all in commemoration of the
300th anniversary of his birth in 1985 produced over 100 CDs. He made major contributions
to every genre of the time except opera, and had he lived in a major cosmopolitan area with
an opera house, he would undoubtedly have composed operas as well.
The duties and circumstances of the different positions Bach held largely dictated the
focus of his compositional activity. Thus, many of his works for organ date from the periods

MUSICIAN BIOGRAPHIES
when he was a church organist, those for instrumental ensemble from when he served Prince
Leopold of Anhalt-Cothen as director of chamber music, and his Lutheran church music from
his 27 years as cantor and director of music of the four principal churches of Leipzig. The
music for the Leipzig Sunday services, which began at 7 A.M. and lasted about three hours,
included an organ prelude and postlude by Bach, often improvised, congregational singing
of hymns selected by Bach, and a multi-movement cantata by Bach for soloists, choir, and
instrumentalists on a text appropriate to that Sunday in the church calendar. In addition
to providing music for church services and civic events, Bach’s responsibilities included the
musical training of the town’s professional musicians, and daily instruction of the boys at the
boarding school attached to the St. Thomas Church. Teaching was an important activity of
Bach’s professional life and a number of his compositions were at least partly didactic. On
the title of page of one of his important collections of keyboard music, the first volume of
The Well-Tempered Clavier, Bach writes that he has composed the 24 preludes and fugues “For
the Use and Profit of Musical Youth Desirous of Learning as well as for the Pastime of those
Already Skilled in this Study.”
Bach’s thousands of surviving works are considered pinnacles of the art of polyphony, the
musical texture consisting of the interweaving of two or more independent but simultaneous
melodies. As described by a contemporary:
The strands of his harmony are really concurrent melodies. They flow easily and expressively,
never engross the hearer’s attention, but divide his interest as now one, now the other becomes
prominent. The combination of several melodies obliges the composer to use devices which are
unnecessary in homophonic music. A single melody can develop as it pleases. But when two or
more are combined each must be so delicately and cleverly fashioned that it can be interwoven
with the others in this direction and that.

There is considerable documentary evidence that Bach’s astonishing mastery of
contrapuntal procedures was apparent not only in the works that survive in notation but
in his ability to create complex polyphonic works extemporaneously. One famous incident
occurred toward the end of his life when he was visiting his son, a musician at the court of the
Prussian monarch Frederick the Great. Bach asked the king, who loved music and was a fairly
accomplished flutist, to “give him a subject for a Fugue, in order to execute it immediately
without any preparation. The King admired the learned manner in which his subject was
thus executed extempore.” Upon returning to Leipzig, Bach wrote out a series of contrapuntal
elaborations on the royal theme that demonstrate every aspect of the art of counterpoint and
dedicated them to the king with the title “Musical Offering.”
Bach may have lived and worked in relative obscurity, but many of his contemporaries
who achieved fame and celebrity during their lifetimes are now considered minor figures while
Bach is regarded as one of the greatest musical geniuses of all time.
Bartok, Bela (1881–1945)
Bela Bartok was born in an area of Hungary that is now the westernmost tip of Romania.
He began piano lessons at age five and in 1899 was admitted to the Budapest Academy of
Music to study piano and composition. After his graduation in 1903, he embarked on a career
unusually wide-ranging in its scope and impact. He was a concertizing pianist; a teacher
of piano and member of the faculty of the Budapest Academy of Music; an internationally
known composer; and a pioneer in the study of Eastern European folk music. In the 1930s,
Bartok was among the many intellectuals and artists who came under attack for their protests
against fascism and in 1940 he emigrated to the United States, where he continued to perform,
teach, compose, and pursue his ethnomusicological research until his death.
Ethnomusicology is the scientific study of music of oral tradition, encompassing tribal
and folk music and the art music produced by various world cultures. The discipline, whose

67

68

MUSICIAN BIOGRAPHIES
origins date back to the 1880s, draws on methodologies of musicology, the scholarly study
of Western art music, and anthropology, whose subject is mankind and human culture.
Throughout the history of Western music, art and folk music repertories have influenced and
enriched each other. The conscious exploitation of folk materials was especially important
among 19th-century composers involved in the nationalist movement, who sought to imbue
their music with a folk flavor by incorporating folk-like elements and even quoting actual folk
melodies. But to Bartok and other ethnomusicologists, folk music was not a source of exotic
atmosphere but an expression of human culture worth documenting for its inherent value.
Beginning in his early twenties, Bartok and his friend and fellow musician Zoltan Kodaly
made numerous expeditions to remote parts of Hungary and neighboring Slavic regions,
recording on wax cylinders thousands of peasant tunes. As recalled by one of the singers they
recorded:
I was a girl. It happened one Sunday…. The professors…asked my mother to receive them and
to agree to my singing into the gramophone for them. They called the machine a ‘gramophone.’
I sang one nice verse, and then another one. It came back sounding so beautiful. The whole
village gathered around us. The whole village. Everyone was wanting to sing. The young men
sang, the old women sang…. I remember that the professors asked me not to sing songs we’d
learned from the soldiers, but only those from the mountain region here. So I only sang ones
from the mountains.

From these recordings, the music and text of the songs were notated, analyzed, and
codified. Bartok’s published transcriptions of Twenty Hungarian Folksongs in 1906 was followed
in 1908 by the first of his many musico-ethnological studies based upon his folk song research.
He also composed numerous arrangements of folk songs—for piano, for voice and piano, for
chorus—often publishing his settings alongside the notations of the tunes as recorded from
the folk singers.
Bartok’s folk music studies were seminal in the formulation of a strikingly personal
language in which compositional practices of art music are fused with melodic, rhythmic,
and harmonic materials of Eastern European folk music. Bartok was himself conscious of
this profound influence, which he acknowledged in his many lectures and writings about
his research and experiences in the field of folk music. As described by a scholar of Bartok’s
music:
His music was nourished by his folkloristic studies while the scientific profited by the musician’s
experience in both theoretical and practical issues. Viewing it from this angle Bartok was a very
rare combination of scientist and artist….And Bartok himself considered his folk music research
as entirely equal in importance to his creative activity as a composer.

That creative activity encompassed a broad range of musical genres—opera and ballet;
orchestral, chamber, and solo piano works; songs and choral compositions. It is in the design
and character of Bartok’s melodies, rhythms, textures, and harmonies that the influence of
Eastern European folk music is most apparent. Bartok’s ethnographic music studies brought
him in contact with melodies based on scales other than major and minor, which is evident in
the modal flavor of many of his works. His use of irregular accents derives from the practice
he encountered of grouping rhythms not into repeated patterns of two’s and three’s but into
five’s, seven’s and other combinations of two’s and three’s. His textures reflect performance
practices in many folk-music traditions that involve the addition of drone accompaniments
and improvised countermelodies created through heterophony and parallel motion. And
Bartok creates sonorities based on pitch combinations characteristic of Eastern European music
in addition to those traditionally employed in Western classical music

MUSICIAN BIOGRAPHIES
Beethoven, Ludwig Van (1770–1827)
Ludwig van Beethoven was born in Bonn, an important intellectual and cultural center in
Germany and the seat of a court that flourished with particular brilliance in the late 18th
century. Beethoven’s father, a court musician, recognized his son’s unusual musical gifts
and sought to exploit them to his own advantage. Yet despite his scheming, which included
representing Beethoven as two years younger than he actually was, and despite the boy’s
extraordinary talents, Beethoven never achieved wide acclaim as a child wonder as had Mozart
a couple of decades earlier. Indeed, it was not until after Beethoven had permanently settled
in Vienna in 1792 that he earned public recognition, initially as a virtuoso pianist, and later
as a composer.
Contemporary accounts of Beethoven’s playing stress especially the compelling emotion
of his performance and his spectacular improvisations. In the words of one witness:
His improvisation was most brilliant and striking. He knew how to achieve such an effect
upon every listener that frequently not an eye remained dry, while many would break out into
loud sobs, for there was something wonderful in his expression in addition to the beauty and
originality of his ideas and his spirited style of rendering them.

The course of Beethoven’s life was profoundly affected by deafness, whose first signs appeared
a few years after his arrival in Vienna when he was in his mid-twenties. At first he tried to
conceal his condition because, as he confessed in a will he drew up in 1802:
It was not possible for me to say: speak louder, shout, because I am deaf. Alas, how would it be
possible for me to admit a weakness of the one sense that should be perfect to a higher degree in
me than in others, the one sense which I once possessed in the highest perfection, a perfection
that few others of my profession have ever possessed…. For me there is no recreation in the
society of others, no intelligent conversation, no mutual exchange of ideas. Only as much as
is required by the most pressing needs can I venture into society. I am obliged to live like an
outcast.

Beethoven’s hearing continued to deteriorate and during the last decade of his life he was
almost totally cut off from experiencing the performance of music. At the premiere of his
great Ninth Symphony in 1824, he sat among the performers, following the manuscript of the
score, but hearing nothing. As reported in a contemporary account:
At the performance, a man went up to him at the end of each movement, tapped him on the
shoulder and pointed to the audience. The motion of the clapping hands and the waving of
handkerchiefs caused him to bow, which gave rise to great jubilation.

Beethoven’s deafness brought his career as a pianist to a premature end. In his
frustration at not being able to hear, he would strike the keys with such force that he broke
hammers and strings, while in soft passages, he would play so lightly that no sound came
out. He was also compelled to curtail his activities as a conductor because of incidents such
as one where “the deaf composer caused the most complete confusion among the singers and
orchestra and got everyone quite out of time, so that no one knew any longer where they
went.”
Beethoven’s social relationships also suffered. Beethoven would speak, but the
spontaneity of the conversation suffered because those with whom he spoke had to write down
their words. Many of these conversation books have been preserved and are an important
source of information about Beethoven’s thoughts, personal relationships, and daily routine.
Observers of the time frequently describe Beethoven as eccentric and coarse-mannered, and
these qualities seem to have been accentuated by his deafness. For example, he spoke too
loudly and often hummed to himself when out walking.

MUSICIAN BIOGRAPHIES
As Beethoven retreated more and more from the world, he directed his energies
increasingly to composition, for though he could no longer hear with his physical ear, he
experienced music and worked out his musical ideas in his hearing mind. According to his
account:
I carry my ideas about with me for a long time, often for a very long time, before I write them
down. In doing so, my memory is so trustworthy that I am sure I will not forget, even after a
period of years, a theme I have once committed to memory. I change a great deal, eliminate
much, and begin again, until I am satisfied with the result. The working-out, in extension, in
paring down, in height and in depth begins in my head and, since I know what I want, the
basic idea never leaves me. It mounts and grows, I hear and see the work in my mind in its
full proportions, as though already accomplished, and all that remains is the labor of writing
it out…. You will ask me where I get my ideas. That I cannot say with certainty. They come
unbidden, indirectly, directly. I could grasp them with my hands. In the midst of nature, in
the woods, on walks, in the silence of the night, in the early morning, inspired by moods that
translate themselves into words for the poet and into tones for me, that sound, surge, roar, until
at last they stand before me as notes.

During the last years of his life, Beethoven was in poor health off and on. Early in the
winter of 1826 he became progressively weaker and died in March of 1827. His funeral, three
days after his death, was attended by 20,000 people.
Beethoven has long been recognized as one of the towering geniuses in music and as one
of the great figures in artistic expression generally. Probably more than any other composer,
his music suggests the grappling of a courageous soul with universal meanings and truths.
The originality and profundity of many of his works, especially those from the last decade of
his life, still astonish and challenge performers and listeners today. His compositions include
9 symphonies, 32 piano sonatas, 16 string quartets, and one opera as well as numerous other
orchestral, chamber, piano, and vocal compositions.
Bernstein, Leonard (1918–1990)
The beginning of Leonard Bernstein’s career as one of the 20th-century’s most remarkable
figures in the world of serious music is usually dated as 1943 when, at the age of 25, he was
called to substitute for the indisposed conductor of the New York Philharmonic. At this time,
Bernstein had studied composition and conducting at Harvard, the Curtis Institute of Music
in Philadelphia, and the Berkshire Music Center in Massachusetts; he had become involved
with a circle of popular entertainers who performed at the Village Vanguard in New York City;
and he had been employed as an arranger and transcriber of popular songs and jazz. His
conducting of the nationally broadcast concert of the New York Philharmonic was praised in
rave reviews on the front page of the New York Times and in other newspapers. This critical
acclaim thrust him into public spotlight, a position he was to retain for the rest of his life.
Over the next decades, Bernstein conducted many of the world’s greatest orchestras,
including the Boston Symphony, Vienna Philharmonic, Metropolitan Opera, and the New
York Philharmonic, of which he served as the first American-born music director from 1958
to 1969. His warm personality, engaging public manner, and dynamic style at the podium
drew large and devoted audiences to his concerts. Millions also learned about music, from
standard repertory to experimental styles and jazz, through his radio broadcasts, televised
lectures, young people’s concerts with the New York Philharmonic, and from his books on
music. He was a particularly effective spokesman for music by American composers, which
he programmed frequently. Like John Kennedy, a friend with whom he shared liberal political
views, Bernstein embodied a particular image of the American character through his energetic
enthusiasm, engaging freshness, photogenic good looks, and ability to communicate with all
kinds of people.
Bernstein’s creative output was wide-ranging, from major concert-hall, chamber, vocal
music and opera to scores for film, dance and Broadway musicals. He drew upon many musical

MUSICIAN BIOGRAPHIES
styles, fusing elements from popular music and jazz with traditional art music practices. His
own Jewish heritage finds voice in the thematic material of several important works, including
the two symphonies subtitled Jeremiah and Kaddish. But he believed music was an international
language and strove to transcend boundaries and reconcile differences through his work as a
musician. In his own words, “I count the artist to be a citizen, a politic contributor to the art
of living together in this lovely land and on this trembling planet.”
Among Bernstein’s best-known works are Mass, which was commissioned by Jacqueline
Kennedy Onassis for the opening of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in
Washington in 1971; the film score for On the Waterfront; the comic opera Candide; and the
musicals Wonderful Town and West Side Story. The latter opened in 1957 at the Winter Garden
Theater and was Bernstein’s greatest Broadway success.
Cage, John (1912–1992)
John Cage was born in Los Angeles. By the time he was in his mid-twenties, he was at the
forefront of experimental music both as a composer and as an exponent of new concepts in
music. His originality as a thinker may be attributable in part to the fact that his father was
an inventor. Cage was not the follower of any “school” of composition. Although he studied
privately with Arnold Schoenberg and was a student in his music theory courses at UCLA,
Cage’s later music would transcend the total control implied by Schoenberg’s serial techniques
in favor of a music free of intention, memory, and personal likes and dislikes. Indeed, Cage’s
notions about the materials and experience of music were equally shaped by his study of
Zen Buddhism and other Eastern philosophies as they were by his study of the compositional
methods of Schoenberg and the music of Anton Webern. Contact with the music of non-Western
cultures was also important in the formation of Cage’s style. In the words of Henry Cowell, a
pioneering American composer and theorist whose example profoundly influenced Cage, “the
future progress for composers of the Western world must inevitably go toward the exploration
and integration of elements drawn from more than one of the world’s cultures.”
Cage regarded all sounds, including noise, as legitimate materials for his compositions,
so in addition to “normal” musical sounds he employed such untraditional sources as
automobile brake drums, thunder sheets, and radios. While studying with Schoenberg, Cage
worked in a book bindery and after hours started a percussion orchestra with his coworkers.
Cage invented his own instruments for the group drawing on the waste materials found in
and around the shop (scrap wood, metal objects, etc.). Years later, in Seattle, Cage was asked
to compose percussion music for a dance, but only had a grand piano available to him.
Remembering some of the piano pieces by Henry Cowell, Cage experimented with putting
small objects between and around different strings of the piano, transforming its timbre so
that it sounded like a percussion ensemble. This became one of Cage’s best-known inventions,
the prepared piano.
Silence can be as important as sound in a work of Cage. A prime example, inspired by
the white paintings of Robert Rauschenberg, was Four Minutes, Thirty-Three Seconds, composed
in 1952 and premiered that same year on August 29th in Woodstock, New York by the pianist
David Tudor. In this performance Tudor came on stage, sat down at the piano, started a
stopwatch, and closed the lid on the piano keyboard to begin the piece. He followed a musical
score with a vertical line drawn on it showing the precise duration for each soundless event,
turning the pages as time passed. After thirty-three seconds Tudor opened the keyboard lid
and reset the stopwatch ending the first movement. For the second movement Tudor followed
the same procedure of stopwatch and keyboard lid, ending after two minutes, forty seconds,
and likewise for the third movement, which lasted one minute, twenty seconds.
Cage was, in effect, asking the audience to experience whatever aural events occurred
during that period of time as being part of his composition, whether ambient sounds or silence.
(In fact, one realizes very quickly that Four Minutes, Thirty-Three Seconds is anything but silent.)

71

72

MUSICIAN BIOGRAPHIES
Cage’s goal was to let sounds exist purely for their own sake within the time structure that he
had established. In his words, the composer should “set about discovering means to let sounds
be themselves rather than vehicles for man-made theories or expressions of human sentiments.”
The Woodstock audience, a group of fellow artists and musicians normally sympathetic to the
avant-garde, was perplexed by this piece and the first performance ended in a riot.
Four Minutes, Thirty-Three Seconds was the culmination of a search that began for
Cage at the end of World War II when he saw what extreme human intention led to in Nazi
Germany. He was “concerned about why one would write music at this time in this society?”
It eventually became clear to him “that the function of art is not to communicate one’s
personal ideas or feelings, but rather to imitate nature in her manner of operation.” Cage
found in the I Ching (the Chinese Book of Changes), with its random procedure for obtaining
an oracle numbered from one to sixty-four, an objective model of how nature operates. After
1950 Cage began to use the I Ching to determine the pitches, durations, and other essential
aspects of his music; initially by using the coin oracle (tossing three copper coins six times) and
later by programming a computer to generate a virtual coin oracle. The result was “chance
music,” in which significant aspects of composition and/or performance are governed through
chance procedures, like the I Ching, in order to free the music from ego, memory, and taste.
With Four Minutes, Thirty-Three Seconds, Cage used the I Ching to compose the piece
“note by note,” it just turned out that each note, according to the I Ching, was silent. His
composition Radio Music is performed by tuning to chance (I Ching) determined stations on
eight radios, producing a mixture of talk, music, and silence, depending on whatever is on
the air at the moment.
Cage also experimented with giving performers greater freedom in their interpretation
of his music. The instructions for one work read “for any number of players, any sounds or
combinations of sounds produced by any means, with or without other activities” (which could
include dance and theater). These experiments were not always successful. At the premiere
of Cage’s Concert for Piano and Orchestra he found that some of the musicians “introduced into
their performance sounds of a nature not found in [his] notation characterized for the most
part by their intention, which had become foolish and unprofessional.”
The scores Cage composed as the music director of the Merce Cunningham Dance
Company were conceived independently of the choreography, so in performance, music and
dance simply coexist rather than being consciously shaped as a unified work. In addition to his
long association with Cunningham, Cage was a close friend of the artists Robert Rauschenberg
and Jasper Johns, both of whom depicted common objects in their paintings, for example,
Johns’ series of the American flag, or numbers and letters of the alphabet. In explaining this
interest in everyday experience, Cage described his intention as “to affirm this life, not to
bring order out of chaos nor to suggest improvements in creation, but simply to wake up to
the very life we’re living, which is so excellent once one gets one’s mind and one’s desires out
of the way and lets it act of its own accord.”
Chopin, Frederic (1810–1849)
Frederic Chopin was born near Warsaw, Poland, of a French father and a Polish mother. He
was a precocious child but largely self-taught in music, receiving most of his formal training
during his high school years at the Warsaw Conservatory. In 1829 he toured Germany and
Italy as a pianist. On a second tour, which took him to France in 1831, he found Parisian
life and society so congenial that he settled there for most of the remainder of his life. His
extraordinary playing and personal charm won him many admirers among the aristocracy
and in artistic circles. Among his artist friends was the novelist George Sand, the pen name of
the novelist Aurore Dudevant, with whom he began a liaison in 1838. After their separation
in 1847, tuberculosis, from which he had been suffering for many years, weakened his already
frail constitution. He died in Paris.

MUSICIAN BIOGRAPHIES
Chopin’s compositions are almost exclusively for the piano. Of the three major keyboard
instruments (piano, harpsichord, organ), the piano is the most familiar and widely used today,
and also the most recent. Its complete name is pianoforte, Italian for soft-loud, reflecting the
fact that varying the pressure with which the keys are depressed directly influences the force
of the hammers that strike the strings and thereby gives the player control over the volume
of sound. The piano was invented in Italy in the early 18th century but did not attract serious
attention from composers and performers until the time of Haydn and Mozart. At this early
period it was a comparatively small, light-framed instrument of delicate tone. By the time of
Chopin, at the height of the romantic period, its pitch and dynamic ranges had been expanded
to essentially those of the modern piano.
During the 19th century, public concerts largely replaced aristocratic patronage as a
major source of income for performers. Audiences of the time expected to be dazzled by the
virtuosity of performers they went to hear and many of Chopin’s works are technically very
challenging. But despite his popularity and success as a concert artist, Chopin soon retired
almost totally from public appearances, preferring to play for small groups of friends and
admirers. As he observed about himself, “I am not the right person to give concerts. The public
intimidates me. I feel asphyxiated by the breath of the people in the audience, paralyzed
by their stares and dumb before that sea of unknown faces.” Indeed, much of his music
seems unsuited to a large concert hall setting. Contemporary observers refer to Chopin as
a “tone poet” and typically stress the delicacy and sensitivity of both his music and his style
of playing it. He was particularly known for his use of rubato, slight pushing forward and
pulling back in tempo for expressive purposes. Even his flashiest, most virtuosic works, such
as the concertos and etudes, require the performer to balance technical prowess with nuances
of tempo, dynamics, and tone color.
Coltrane, John (1926–1967)
After Charlie Parker, saxophonist and composer John Coltrane is probably the most widely
imitated saxophonist in jazz. Born the son of a minister in North Carolina, he was something
of a late-bloomer as a musician; his earliest recordings, from the 1940s, show only a shadow
of the genius he would become. But by the mid-1950s, he was one of the most important jazz
musicians on the scene, and the recordings he made with Thelonious Monk and Miles Davis
(especially Davis’s Kind of Blue from 1959) are now legendary.
A gentle, deeply spiritual man, Coltrane was also obsessed with music: It was not
uncommon for him to spend an entire night practicing in his room after playing three sets
in a jazz club. His style showed immense authority of his instrument, yet also a deep passion
gained from his early exposure to black church music and his experience playing with rhythmand-blues bands in the 1940s. He is also noteworthy as a composer of such jazz standards as
“Impressions,” “Naima,” and “Giant Steps,” the latter—with its complex, rapidly changing
chord structure—still a “test” piece for aspiring jazz musicians. Coltrane’s quartet of the
1960s—which featured bassist Jimmy Garrison, pianist McCoy Tyner, and drummer Elvin
Jones—was, along with Miles Davis’s Quintet, one of the most important jazz ensembles of
the decade. This group recorded, in 1964, what is widely considered Coltrane’s masterpiece:
the four-movement suite A Love Supreme. This work, inspired by a “religious awakening”
Coltrane experienced in 1957, featured in its last movement the “sermonizing” on saxophone
of a text Coltrane wrote himself, which is included with the liner notes. Coltrane also became
deeply interested in avant-garde jazz of Ornette Colemen and others, recording in 1965 a 40minute nearly atonal group improvisation called Ascension. Coltrane was strongly interested
in Eastern spirituality and philosophy, and some even came to view him as something of a
religious mystic (though he never encouraged this trend himself). To this day there is still a
Church of St. John Coltrane in San Francisco, which features weekly performances of music
from A Love Supreme. His early death from liver cancer, at age 40, was an immense loss to the
jazz community.

MUSICIAN BIOGRAPHIES
Copland, Aaron (1900–1990)
Aaron Copland was born in Brooklyn of Russian Jewish immigrant parents. He was the last
of five children and the only child who was not given music lessons. However, he picked up
the rudiments of the piano from an older sister and then, on his own initiative, began formal
piano lessons and later studies in harmony and counterpoint. He also attended concerts at the
Brooklyn Academy of Music. At 20 Copland followed the path that had become traditional for
young American artists: He set off for several years of study and travel in Europe. He returned to
the United States in 1924, thoroughly trained in techniques of French modernism and strongly
under the spell of Stravinsky, as evident in works composed at this time. But Copland had
also become interested his own national heritage and shared with other American composers
a desire to cultivate a style both modern and uniquely American. In his own words:
We wanted to find a music that would speak of universal things in a vernacular of American
speech rhythms. We wanted to write music on a level that left popular music far behind—
music with a largeness of utterance wholly representative of the country that Whitman had
envisaged.

He saw his goal as creating “a musical vernacular, which, as language, would cause no
difficulties to my listeners” while at the same time “composing in an idiom that might be
accessible only to cultivated listeners.” The attempt to reconcile “low brow” and “high brow”
has challenged many American composers of the last century and led to new syntheses such
as rock opera and symphonic jazz.
Copland’s American orientation is reflected in the subjects of many of his compositions,
for example, the ballets Billy the Kid (1938), Rodeo (1942), and Appalachian Spring (1944); his
scores for films based on stories by John Steinbeck, Thornton Wilder, and Henry James; and
orchestral works with such titles as John Henry, Lincoln Portrait, and Fanfare for the Common
Man. His quotation of folk tunes and use of jazz rhythms, his sturdy, wide-ranging melodies
and energetic rhythms, and the openness and clarity of his orchestration are among the
“American” features of his style.
At his death, Copland had become one of the most influential figures in American
music. In addition to his composing activities, he was a leader in promoting new music
through his books and articles, the concerts he organized and musician’s groups he founded,
his lectures at Harvard and The New School, and his teaching of young composers. His own
creative work received crucial support through private patronage, prizes, and commissions.
His many awards include a Pulitzer Prize, an Oscar, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
Davis, Miles (1926–1991)
Trumpeter, bandleader, and composer, Miles Davis was one of the most important jazz
musicians of the post–WW II period. With a restless spirit and hugely creative imagination,
he participated in (and often led) some of the most important developments in jazz after the
early bebop records of the mid-1940s. Davis began his career playing on some of the important
early bebop sessions, accompanied by musicians such as Charlie Parker. In the late 1940s
he began a long collaboration with arranger and composer Gil Evans, which resulted in two
of the most important and popular jazz albums ever produced: The Birth of the Cool (1949)
and Kind of Blue (1959). The latter remains possibly the best-selling jazz album of all time. In
these sessions, and many others, Davis reinterpreted the legacy of Charlie Parker and Dizzy
Gillespie, softening the edges somewhat, and focusing on distinctive sonorities (Birth of the
Cool featured a large ensemble that included a French horn). In the late 1950s, Davis explored
“modal jazz”—that is, jazz improvisation that is built on a particular scale rather than a chord
progression. In “Flamenco Sketches” from Kind of Blue, for example, the soloists are given five
scales and allowed to improvise on each as long as they wish. Davis’s influential quintet of
the 1960s, which featured saxophonist Wayne Shorter, drummer Tony Williams, bassist Ron

MUSICIAN BIOGRAPHIES
Carter, and pianist Herbie Hancock, helped redefine the role of the rhythm section in jazz
(making it an equal partner with the other soloists) and often featured loose improvisations on
melodic motives and tonal centers, rather than chords. In the late 1960s, strongly influenced
by rock and soul groups (especially Sly and the Family Stone), Davis made the controversial
move to amplified instruments and rock-based rhythms, particularly in his album Bitches
Brew (1970). He is considered at the forefront of the jazz-rock fusion movement, and many
alumni from his group (including Shorter and Hancock) went on to play with highly successful
fusion groups. In the 1980s, Davis continued to remain relevant by surrounding himself with
younger musicians and recording current popular songs, such as “Human Nature,” featured
on Michael Jackson’s Thriller album. In 2006, Davis was inducted posthumously into the Rock
and Roll Hall of Fame.
Dvorak, Antonin (1841–1904)
The Czech composer Antonin Dvorak was one of Europe’s most accomplished composers of
the latter 19th century and one of the most influential figures of the nationalist movement in
what is now Czechoslovakia. His romantic orchestral, choral, and chamber works were often
influenced by Slovic and other Eastern European folk music.
In 1892 Dvorak accepted a position at the National Conservatory of Music in New York
to teach composition and orchestration and to conduct the choir and orchestra. The following
year Dvorak composed one of his most famous pieces, Symphony no. 9, From the New World,
which was premiered in Carnegie Hall in December of 1893. Based on simple pentatonic
themes, which Dvorak believed were common to Native American and African American folk
music, the piece occasionally evokes a feeling of African American spirituals and includes a
fragment from “Swing Low Sweet Chariots” in the G major theme of the work.
In 1893 Dvorak penned an article in the New York Herald in which he urged American
composers to turn to their own folk music, particularly African American melodies and
Native American chants, as source material for compositions that would reflect a distinctly
“American” flavor. While a number of composers tried unsuccessfully to work with Native
American materials, black spirituals influenced the works of a number of American composers
including George Gershwin, Aaron Copland, William Grant Still, Harry Burleigh, and Duke
Ellington.
Dylan, Bob (b. 1941)
Born Robert Zimmerman in Duluth, Minnesota, singer/songwriter/poet Bob Dylan is the
most influential popular folk singer in the post–WW II years. After a year of college Dylan
dropped out of the University of Minnesota and in early 1961 arrived in Greenwich Village
where he became a rising star in the burgeoning folk music scene. His gruff voice and wailing
harmonica on his first recording of traditional ballads, blues, and gospel songs made for
Columbia Records in 1962 became his trademark. On his second album, Freewheelin’ Bob Dylan
(1963), he demonstrated his prowess as a brilliant songwriter with such pieces as “Blowing in
the Wind” and “Don’t Think Twice Its All Right.” The former established Dylan as a national
figure when the popular folk trio Peter Paul, and Mary made the song a hit in 1963. Over
the next two years Dylan turned out a number of topical songs in the Woody Guthrie/Pete
Seeger tradition. Pieces such as “Masters of War,” “It’s a Hard Rain Gonna Fall,” “The Times
They Are a Changing,” “With God on Our Side,” “Only a Pawn in Their Game,” and “Oxford
Town” were seething indictments of war and racism in America. These protest songs earned
him the title of “the voice of the new generation,” a role he would soon reject. As he matured,
his lyrics began to become more abstract and surreal in songs like “Mr. Tambourine Man”
and “My Back Pages.”
In 1965 Dylan shocked the folk music world by appearing at the Newport Festival
with a loud, raucous electric backup band. Accused of “selling out” the acoustic folk music
revival with his electric rock-influenced arrangements, Dylan nonetheless went on to forge

75

76

MUSICIAN BIOGRAPHIES
a new sound that critics dubbed “folk rock.” In 1965 and 1966 he released three albums of
original songs backed by an electric band that today are considered his most creative work.
His overt protest songs had evolved into more subtle and poetic critiques of modern society
and individual alienation with compositions such as “Maggie’s Farm,” “Subterranean Home
Sick Blues,” “Mr. Jones,” “Desolation Row,” and his anthem-like “Like a Rolling Stone,” which
charted number two in summer of 1965 and established Dylan as a bona fide rock star.
Following a motor cycle accident in 1966 Dylan became reclusive and did not tour again
until the mid-1970s. He continued to write enduring songs that demonstrated his genius for
transforming elements of traditional country, blues, and spiritual songs into fresh, modernsounding compositions.
Ellington, Edward Kennedy “Duke” (1899–1974)
Ellington was born into a middle-class black Washington family. His father was a butler in
the White House and had the means to provide his son with a solid education and cultural
opportunities, including piano lessons. For a brief period after winning a high school poster
designing contest, Ellington ran his own sign-making business. However, he soon gave up
commercial art to play piano in Washington clubs, then in 1923 moved to New York where
he became leader of a small combo. In the late 1920s his band began a five-year stint at the
famous Cotton Club in Harlem, which established him as a pianist, composer, and arranger
of genius and originality. Recordings and international tours over the next decades spread the
reputation of Ellington’s band and at his death in 1974 he was widely recognized as perhaps
the most versatile and accomplished creative force in the history of jazz. His many honors
include presidential medals, honorary degrees, and keys to many cities all over the world. He
earned the nickname “Duke” early in life because of his personal refinement and elegance.
Among the sources of Ellington’s music are the blues, the “hot” style of solo improvisation,
and images of urban life (“Take the ‘A’ Train,” “Harlem Air-Shaft”). His compositions have
been estimated at six thousand, including popular songs, instrumental pieces, film scores,
musical comedies, ballets, and an opera. He was the first jazz composer to enlarge the scope
of jazz composition, extending the length of individual works and employing devices of
thematic treatment associated with the Western classical tradition. In the last decade of his
life he devoted himself especially to writing sacred music, a natural expression of his deep
religious faith. Although he was an extraordinary pianist, Ellington generally gave himself
only a modest role in his music, commenting that “my instrument is not the piano, it’s the
orchestra.” Indeed, his compositions characteristically feature other members of his band.
These included many of the best musicians of the time, and Ellington’s arrangements and
orchestrations were always heavily influenced by their personalities. As the membership of
the band changed, so did Ellington’s style so that many of his works have been recorded in
quite different interpretations.
Gershwin, George (1898–1937)
The son of Russian Jewish immigrants, Brooklyn-born George Gershwin began his musical
career as a Tin Pan Alley pianist and songwriter, quickly rising to prominence as a writer for
the Broadway stage and composer of orchestral works. Gershwin began taking formal piano
lessons at the age of twelve, and as a teenager worked as a house pianist in a musical publishing
house in Midtown’s legendary Tin Pan Alley. There he absorbed the sounds of musical theater,
Broadway popular songs, and ragtime. His first hit song, “Swanee” (written in 1919 with lyrics
by B. G. DeSylvia) sold over a million copies when popularized by the famous singer Al Jolson,
and propelled Gershwin onto the Broadway Stage where he would write some of America’s
most notable musicals. His most successful shows, including Lady, Be Good (1924), Oh Kay
(1926), Funny Face (1927), and Girl Crazy (1930), were written in collaboration with his lyricist
brother Ira Gershwin (1896–1983) and featured songs heavily influenced by the syncopated

MUSICIAN BIOGRAPHIES
rhythms and blues tonality of ragtime and early jazz. Gershwin’s musicals helped define the
modern American musical that moved beyond the vaudeville-derived review to a show with
an integrated plot and sophisticated musical score.
Although he lacked formal conservatory training in music theory, composition, and
orchestration, Gershwin nonetheless was determined to write serious music. In 1924 his
first extended orchestral composition, Rhapsody in Blue, premiered in a concert of new works
billed as “An Experiment in Modern Music.” Gershwin’s Rhapsody was built around five
distinctive themes that reflected his genius as writer of memorable melodies, and incorporated
syncopated rhythms, blues tonalities, and jazzy instrumental shadings (such as the use of
muted brass). The success of Rhapsody and his subsequent compositions Concerto in F (1925)
and An American in Paris (1928) established him as a leading figure in the emerging symphonic
jazz movement that sought to create extended compositions by fusing European orchestral
forms and instrumentation with jazz-inflected rhythms and tonalities.
Gershwin’s achievements with symphonic jazz in the 1920s and the sophisticated
operettas of the 1930s—Strike Up the Band (1930), Of Thee I Sing (1931, the first musical comedy
to win the Pulitzer Prize), and Let’m Eat Cake (1933)—led critics of both decades to cast him as
a contender for the honor of creating the first distinctly American opera. In 1935 he premiered
Porgy and Bess, based on the 1926 novel Porgy— DuBose Heyward’s wistful tale of life, love, and
death in Catfish Row, a semi-fictitious black slum situated adjacent to the bustling docks of
Charleston, South Carolina, the author’s hometown. Part opera and part Broadway musical,
Porgy and Bess remains one of America’s most enduring staged works, and produced several of
Gershwin’s most memorable songs including “Summertime,” “It Ain’t Necessarily So,” and
“I Loves You Porgy.”
In 1936 Gershwin relocated in Los Angeles and the following year wrote the soundtrack
for the popular movie Shall We Dance staring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. But that year
Gershwin unexpectedly fell ill and died of a brain tumor at the age of 38. Today his songs,
musicals, and opera endure and he remains one of America’s most beloved songwriters and
perhaps its most popular composer.
Gillespie, John Birks “Dizzy” (1917-1993)
Jazz trumpeter, pianist, arranger and composer. Along with Charlie “Yardbird” (or “Bird”)
Parker, Gillespie is credited as one of the founding fathers of modern jazz. He was originally
self-taught on a variety of instruments, but in 1933 he attended the Laurinberg Institute
in North Carolina. After two years playing trumpet with the school’s band, he moved to
Philadelphia, where he met trumpeter Charlie Shavers. It was through Shavers that Gillespie
was introduced to the artistry of his great musical hero, trumpeter Roy Eldridge; in fact, many
of his early solos are very much in Eldridge’s style. It was in Philadelphia that Gillespie’s
clowning earned him the nickname “Dizzy” (sometimes shortened to “Diz.”). Gillespie moved
to New York in 1937, and joined singer Cab Calloway’s band in 1939. It was in this band
that the trumpeter met Afro-Cuban percussionist Mario Bauzá, sparking a lifelong interest
in the fusion of jazz and Latin American music. Gillespie also provided some imaginative
compositions and arrangements for Calloway’s ensemble. Gillespie first met Parker in 1940,
and was soon participating in the after-hours jam sessions that would give rise to the new jazz
style known as “bebop.” Gillespie made a variety of important recordings with Parker before
the latter’s premature death in 1955. He performed with some of the most important jazz
artists of his day, and, with conga player Chano Pozo, made some of the earliest explorations
into the fusion of jazz and Afro-Cuban music, the most famous being “Manteca” of 1947. In
the 1950s, Gillespie toured internationally for the State Department. In the 1980s, he returned
to work with small groups, often with younger musicians, and continued performing up to
the time of his death. He usually played a peculiarly bent horn, which, though originally the
result of accidental damage, produced a tone he preferred. It is now housed in the Smithsonian
Institution.

MUSICIAN BIOGRAPHIES
Handel, George Frederic (1685–1759)
George Frederic Handel was born in Halle, a town in northern Germany where he received
his early musical instruction from a local organist. In accordance with his father’s wishes, he
prepared for a career in law. On his father’s death in 1703, Handel moved to Hamburg where
his first two operas were successfully staged. In 1706 he accepted an invitation to Italy. The
dramatic and Latin church music he composed during his three years in Florence, Rome, Naples,
and Venice reveal the profound influence of his contacts with Italian musicians, particularly
in his development of a richly expressive melodic style. In the words of one historian, “He
arrived in Italy a gifted but crude composer with an uncertain command of form, and left it a
polished and fully equipped artist.” In 1709 Handel accepted a position in Hanover, Germany,
but with the provision that he be granted a year’s leave in London. He enjoyed considerable
success with both the English nobility and public and in 1712 he returned to London, which
became his home for the rest of his life.
Handel composed a phenomenal number of vocal and instrumental compositions,
many of them intended for public performance for the rising English middle class. The
pressures of continually producing new works led him to reuse his own material and to draw
on that of others, generally without attribution. When asked about his borrowing from one
particular composer, Handel is reported to have responded that the material in question was
“much too good for him, he did not know what to do with it.”
Handel was particularly drawn to composing operas on Italian librettos, which during
the Baroque period favored stories from Greek mythology and ancient history. The plots
provided a loose framework for extravagant display of vocal virtuosity that, along with lavish
scenic effects, drew audiences to hear their favorite singers. Numerous contemporary accounts
describe audiences talking, eating, and playing cards during the recitatives, waiting for their
favorite singer’s next aria. One of the bizarre manifestations of this superstar adulation was
the castrati, male sopranos and altos whose change of voice had been surgically prevented
during puberty. The practice, originally associated with the choir of the Sistine Chapel in
Rome, continued into the 19th century and is said to have produced voices with the purity
and range of a boy but the strength and endurance of a man. The career of one of the most
famous castrati of Handel’s day is the subject of the 1995 film, Farinelli. Leading male roles
were assigned to the castrati, for example, the role of Caesar in Handel’s Guilio Cesare in Egitto
(Julius Caesar in Egypt). In contemporary revivals of Baroque operas, castrati roles are either
sung by a woman or by a countertenor (a man with an alto range), or the music is transposed
down to a normal male range.
Handel composed over 40 operas, most during his years as the musical director of London
opera companies. In addition to providing new operas each season, either by himself or
other composers, Handel made yearly trips to the continent to engage the sensational singers
who the public would pay to hear. During intermission, audiences were treated to Handel
performing his organ concertos.
Another important category of Handel’s output is the oratorio, whose musical structure
is similar to that of opera, but is based on a religious subject and performed without costumes,
scenery, and acting. The Old Testament furnished the material for most of Handel’s 25
oratorios—among them Saul, Israel in Egypt, Samson, Joshua, and Solomon—which were presented
in public concert halls during Lent, when operas and other theatrical entertainments were
banned from the stage. The texts of the oratorios are in English, which probably contributed to
their enormous popularity with the English public. His instrumental works include concertos,
the Water Music performed for King George I by musicians on a barge in the Thames, and
Music for the Royal Fireworks for a fireworks display.
Hardin (Armstrong), Lillian (1898–1971)
Lillian Hardin, a pianist and composer, was one of the few women to forge a long and
successful career in the male-dominated world of early jazz and in a segregated America. Born

MUSICIAN BIOGRAPHIES
in Memphis, Tennessee, she took piano lessons as a child and briefly attended Fisk University
before moving with her family to Chicago in 1917. Because she could read music, she got
a job demonstrating sheet music at a music store, where she attracted the attention of local
bandleaders. While performing with King Oliver’s Creole Jazz Band, she met Louis Armstrong.
They married in 1924 and Hardin (Armstrong) is generally credited with encouraging the
young trumpeter to strike out on his own. During the 1920s she played the piano and sang
on many of the recordings of the Hot Five and Hot Seven and composed several of the group’s
hit songs. Though usually relegated to the role of accompanist, her occasional solos show
a talented pianist strongly influenced by Jelly Roll Morton (whom she knew well), and even
hint at a well-developed classical technique. During the 1930s Hardin (Armstrong) worked in
New York, where she appeared in several Broadway shows and also led her own swing band.
She returned to Chicago in 1940 where she continued to perform in nightclubs and record.
Armstrong and Hardin separated in 1931 and were divorced in 1938, but they remained
friends for the rest of their lives. In August of 1971, while playing in a memorial concert for
Armstrong who had died the previous month, Hardin (Armstrong) suffered a massive heart
attack and died.
Haydn, Franz Joseph (1732–1809)
The details of Haydn’s early life are sketchy. He was born in an Austrian village and came
from a humble background. At about the age of eight he was chosen to join the choir of one
of Vienna’s most important cathedrals. After his voice changed, he supported himself by
teaching and working as a freelance performer, then at the age of 29, entered the service of
a wealthy and powerful Hungarian aristocratic family, the Esterhazys. Music was a central
component of life at the Esterhazy estate in the Hungarian countryside and the household staff
included orchestral musicians, opera singers, and a chapel choir. Haydn’s contract specified
that he was responsible to provide music as required by the prince, care for the musicians
and instruments, and conduct himself “as befits an honest house officer in a princely court.”
For 30 years Haydn lived and worked at the Esterhazy palace, largely isolated from what was
happening elsewhere. As he himself recalled, “My prince was content with all my works, I
received approval, I could, as head of an orchestra, make experiments, observe what created
an impression, and what weakened it, thus improving, adding to, cutting away, and running
risks. I was set apart from the world, there was nobody in my vicinity to confuse and annoy
me in my course, and so I had to become original.” With the succession of a new Esterhazy
prince in 1790, Haydn’s life took a new direction. Although he continued to earn a salary,
he was no longer required to live at the Esterhazy estate. He moved back to Vienna, one of
the musical capitals of the time, where he met and befriended Mozart and for several years
was the teacher of the young Beethoven. He also accepted invitations for two lengthy trips to
London, for which he composed a number of important new works. In London, performances
devoted to his music, including 12 brilliant new symphonies, were highlights of the concert
season. He appeared before the royal family, was sought after as a guest at social occasions,
and was awarded an honorary doctorate from Oxford University. In Vienna, where his
monumental oratorios The Creation and The Seasons were enthusiastically received, he was
named an honorary citizen. At his death at the age of 77, Haydn had become one of Europe’s
most celebrated figures.
Haydn’s vast compositional output includes 52 piano sonatas, 104 symphonies,
concertos for a variety of instruments, works for a variety of chamber groupings, masses and
other sacred vocal music, operas, and oratorios. Written over more than a half century, his
works document the transition from the late Baroque to the mature classical style, to which he
himself made definitive contributions. In his works in sonata form, he deepened and extended
practices of motivic development and he elevated the string quartet from one of many possible
groupings to the most important chamber music ensemble. His late symphonies balance

79

80

MUSICIAN BIOGRAPHIES
simplicity of themes with brilliant orchestration. And his musical language encompasses
a broad spectrum of expressive content—folk-like innocence, intense passion, playfulness,
high-spirited humor, tenderness, joyful exuberance, sorrow.
Ives, Charles (1874–1954)
Charles Ives was born in New England. He received a thorough education, including college
at Yale where he studied composition and was organist of a New Haven church, in addition to
pursuing a regular academic program. But the most profound influences on his personality
and political, religious, and aesthetic views were his New England heritage and his father, a
village bandmaster and something of a renegade in his musical thinking. After graduation
from Yale, Ives came to New York where he began a successful career in the insurance business,
believing that “a man could keep his music interest stronger, cleaner, bigger and freer if he didn’t
try to make a living out of it.” He composed evenings and weekends, completing hundreds of
songs, choral works, piano pieces, and works for a variety of instrumental groupings, from a
few players to a full symphony orchestra. The strain of this rigorous routine took its toll and
in 1918 Ives suffered his first heart attack, after which he gradually retired to a life of seclusion
with his wife, Harmony, at their home in Connecticut. At his death his works, most of which
were in manuscript, were just beginning to attract attention outside the small group that had
long recognized his originality and importance as a truly American voice.
Ives’s music, with its bold, adventurous experiments with tonal materials and structures,
is rooted in the American ideals of rugged independence and freedom of individual expression,
which also inspired such observations as the following:
“Beauty in music is too often confused with something that lets the ears lie back in an easy
chair.”
“Down with politicians & Up with the People!”
“Some of these… pieces…were in part made to strengthen the ear muscles, the mind muscles,
and perhaps the Soul muscles, too.”
“The great fundamental truths—freedom over slavery; the natural over the artificial; the goodness
of man; the Godness of man; God.”

Many of Ives’s works are highly personal recreations of his own experiences, memories,
and imagination with such titles as George Washington’s Birthday, Central Park in the Dark, The
Circus Band, From the Steeples and the Mountains, Harvest Home Chorales, The Concord Sonata,
General William Booth Enters into Heaven. The titles of others—Three Quarter-Tone Pieces for Two
Pianos, Chromatimelodtune, Tone Roads, for example—suggest the abstract, purely musical
dimension of Ives’s compositional thinking. In both types, he often quotes or imitates marches,
ragtime, patriotic, folk, and popular songs within a complex, dissonant, and seemingly
discontinuous musical fabric.
Joplin, Scott (1868–1917)
Joplin was born and raised in Texarkana, on the border between Texas and Arkansas. His
father, an ex-slave, scraped together enough money to buy a piano for his musically inclined
son, who soon taught himself to play with remarkable facility. In his early teens Joplin left
home to seek a musical career in St. Louis, Chicago, and Sedalia, Missouri, finally moving to
New York in 1907. Joplin’s compositions include about 50 rags for piano, a folk ballet, and
two operas. Though the earliest of his operas, A Guest of Honor, has been lost, the second,
Treemonisha, was completed in 1910 and though never fully staged at the time has since
become a staple of the operatic repertoire. His early piano rags, especially “Maple Leaf

MUSICIAN BIOGRAPHIES
Rag” of 1899, brought him considerable fame and fortune and earned him the title King of
Ragtime. But with the passing of the ragtime craze after the first decade of the new century,
and the increasing complexity of his compositions, Joplin found little appreciation for his
work. Afflicted by syphilis, Joplin’s health declined until his death in 1917.
Josquin des Prez (c. 1440–1521)
One of the greatest composers of the Renaissance, Josquin des Prez was born in the north of
France and spent about two decades of his creative career in Italy. His first appearance in
documents as a musician comes in 1477, when he is named as a singer in the court of Rene
of Anjou in France. The early 1480s are largely unaccounted for, but by the middle of the
decade he was working for Cardinal Ascanio Sforza of Milan, before moving to work for the
papal chapel in Rome. After a period of employment at the Florentine court of Duke Ercole
d’Este in the early 1500s, he returned to France where he died.
Although biographical detail about Josquin is scant, including the exact date and place
of his birth, there is ample evidence of his fame during his own day. Aristocratic patrons vied
to have him in their employ, even passing over highly respected contemporaries who were
known to be cheaper, easier to get along with, and more reliable about completing work on
time. He was particularly admired for his mastery of counterpoint and his gift for expressing
the meaning of words in his musical settings, an important goal of humanist composers. In
the words of one commentator, “Josquin may be said to have been, in music, a prodigy of
nature, just as our Michelangelo Buonarroti has been in architecture, painting and sculpture.
Thus far there has not been anybody who in his compositions approaches Josquin. As with
Michelangelo, among those who have been active in these his arts, he is still alone and without
a peer. Both have opened the eyes of all those who delight in these arts or are to delight in
them in the future.” One surviving portrait thought to be of Josquin is attributed to Leonardo
da Vinci, and his death was mourned in several musical laments.
The invention of music printing during Josquin’s lifetime, coupled with his fame and
popularity, ensured the preservation of a large number of his works and his enduring reputation
today. Recent scholarship indicates some works formerly attributed to Josquin were, in fact,
by other composers but published under Josquin’s name to ensure wider sales. As reported
by one commentator toward the end of the period, “I recall that a certain famous man said
that Josquin wrote more compositions after his death than during his life.”
Josquin’s surviving output is entirely vocal and, even discounting disputed works,
impressive in quantity: 18 complete setting of the Mass, over 100 polyphonic settings of Latin
religious texts (motets), and about 80 on French and Italian secular texts. Most are for four
voices—soprano, alto, tenor, bass—and, following the practice of the time, to be performed
a cappella, that is, by voices alone, without instruments. His gracefully shaped vocal lines
interact in a highly contrapuntal web, diverging, converging, crossing, echoing, and imitating
each other, sometimes with great rhythmic independence, sometimes in hymn-style texture.
King, B. B. (b. 1925)
Riley B. King, better known as B. B. King, is unquestionably the most influential bluesmen of
the 20th century. Born on a plantation near Indianola, Mississippi, he moved to Memphis in
the late 1940s where he gained local fame as a singer, guitarist, and host of a weekly blues
show on WDIA, the first major radio station to go to an all black format in 1948. His 1951
R& B hit “Three O’Clock in the Morning” launched a recording and touring career that would
eventually make him the world’s most renowned blues singer.
King’s guitar style, based around eloquent single-string runs, is a refinement of
techniques pioneered by legendary blues guitarists Blind Lemon Jefferson, Robert Johnson, and
T-bone Walker. King’s guitar solos were backed by smooth, riffing horns and a pulsing rhythm
section that combined to define a style know as “jump blues” in the 1950s. His early vocals

81

82

MUSICIAN BIOGRAPHIES
were in the vein of classic blues shouters, but as he matured his voice took on a distinctive
gospel feel, characterized by a soulful, pleading delivery complete with falsetto swoops, shouts,
and extended melismas (stretching a single syllable over several pitches).
In the late 1960s, following appearances at the Newport Folk Festival and Bill Graham’s
legendary rock palace the Filmore West, King extended his popularity among younger white
audiences. Eric Clapton, George Harrison, and the Rolling Stones were among the many rock
stars who idolized King’s music and who recognized his contributions to the development of
rock and roll. In the new millennium King’s sophisticated blues sound continues to move
black and white audiences, and his Time Square blues club (opened in 2000) remains a center
of blues activity in New York City.
Charles Mingus (1922–1979)
Jazz composer, bassist, and band leader Charles Mingus is one of the most creative proponents
of modern jazz. Born in Arizona in 1922, he grew up in the Watts section of Los Angeles, where
in school he studied trombone, cello, and bass, learning both jazz and classical techniques.
He toured with big bands led by Louis Armstrong and Lionel Hampton before moving to New
York in the early 1950s. There he worked with bop musicians Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie,
and Bud Powell before staring his own ensemble in the mid-1950s. During this period he
became active in New York’s Jazz Composer’s Workshop, and eventually abandoned written
transcription and began dictating his compositions to his players by ear, allowing them
considerable room for personal interpretation. By the early 1960s he had established himself
as the premiere bassist in jazz, and a leading composer for both big band and small ensemble
formats.
Mingus drew on many styles, ranging from blues, gospel, and big-band swing to bebop
and modern jazz that featured dissonant, collective improvisation. Among his best know
compositions are the bluesy Haitian Fight Song (1957), the extended jazz suite Pithecanthropus
Erectus (1956) that chronicles the rise and decline of modern civilization with a finale of
cacophonous improvisation, and the classical sounding Half-mast Inhibition (1960). Mingus
objected to categories like “classical” and “jazz,” choosing rather to construct extended works
that combined compositional forms, themes, and complex harmonic changes associated with
classical music with techniques of individual and group improvisation, complex rhythms, and
tonal elements of blues and gospel common to jazz.
Perhaps the most important jazz composer of the mid 20th century, Mingus summed
up his creative philosophy on liner notes to the 1956 Pithecanthropus Erectus LP:
I “write” compositions—but only on mental score paper—then I lay out the composition part
by part to the musicians. I play them the “framework” on piano so that they are all familiar
with my interpretation and feeling and with the scale and chord progressions to be used. Each
man’s own particular style is taken into consideration, both in ensembles and in solos….In this
way, I find it possible to keep my own compositional flavor in the pieces and yet to allow the
musicians more individual freedom in the creation of their group lines and solos.

Monk, Meredith (b. 1942)
One of America’s foremost experimental composers, Meredith Monk grew up in New York
City in an artistic household. Her mother was a professional singer, working primarily
in radio through the nineteen-thirties and forties. Although Monk identifies herself as a
composer, she does not separate music from the other performing arts. While a student
at Sarah Lawrence College she studied singing, composition, and dance and performed in
theater as a student in their combined performing arts program. Her earliest works, such as
16 Millimeter Earrings, included film along with music, theater and dance, establishing Monk

MUSICIAN BIOGRAPHIES
as a significant multidisciplinary artist and eluding classification of her work by critics until
the term performance artist came into usage.
Monk is less interested in telling a narrative story through her performance art than
she is in creating an experience where all of the faculties are employed. The music, words,
movement, and staging all have equal importance. She is an attentive listener to the sounds
in her environment and she often develops extended performance techniques in order to replicate
some of those that are more interesting. The influences on her extended vocal techniques,
in particular, include the music of non-European cultures (harmonic singing and ululation),
city sounds (the glissando of a car alarm), and the sounds of nature (bird song and animal
cries).
In Dolmen Music, Monk allows us to peak into an archaic community inspired by her
reaction to seeing the dolmen in Brittany (La Roche aux Fées). Her initial response to The Fairy
Rocks inspired her to infuse the work with the sense of being ancient and futuristic at the
same time. A Meredith Monk piece usually has no specific interpretation yet many works,
like Memory Song and Gotham Lullaby, are so intimate that they often engender an explicit
meaning in the listener based on their life experiences.
While the timbres that Monk creates may be complex and unusual, the music
underlying her work is often simple and consonant. The pure open intervals of medieval
music are especially attractive to Monk. She once stated that the European music that she
most admired began with the Medieval and went through to the Renaissance, skipped the
Common Practice Period, and continued with 20th/21st Century music. One of her favorite
composers is Perotin.
Monk, Thelonious (1917–1982)
Pianist and composer. Monk is one of the most important figures in jazz history, but he is also
one of the most controversial and least-understood. Born in Rocky Mount, North Carolina,
Monk’s family moved to New York when he was four, and he remained there the rest of his
life. In the early 1940s he became house pianist at Minton’s in Harlem, helping to formulate
what would become “bebop”—the style that would define modern jazz—though Monk himself
never considered himself a “bebopper” and his music does not fit easily into that category.
Monk was a highly accomplished pianist, but his idiosyncratic keyboard technique—full of
dry, punchy chords, complex syncopations, intentional “wrong notes,” and long stretches
of silence—led many to believe mistakenly that he was simply a poor musician. His erratic
personal behavior did little to improve his stature in many peoples’ eyes, though his influence
on other musicians such as Dizzy Gillespie and John Coltrane remains legendary. Monk’s most
important contribution to jazz may be as a composer, for pieces such as “Round Midnight,”
“Straight No Chaser,” and “Ruby, My Dear” not only became jazz standards but expanded
harmonic, rhythmic, and formal possibilities for those who improvised on them. Recent
scholarship—much of it as yet unpublished—will hopefully provide a better understanding
of this enigmatic musician.
Mozart, Wolfgang Amadeus (1756–1791)
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born in Salzburg, an Austrian cathedral town where his father
was a violinist in the orchestra of the archbishop, an important official in the Roman Catholic
Church. All evidence indicates that Mozart’s natural musical gifts were phenomenal and
became apparent at an early age. When he was six, his father took him on the first of several
extended European tours, one lasting more than three years, during which he astonished
audiences with his ability to compose, improvise, and perform at the keyboard and on the
violin. The many surviving letters between members of the Mozart family and friends back
home in Salzburg record the highs and lows of these trips, from the exhilaration of command
performances before royalty to the dangers and discomforts of travel by coach and several

83

84

MUSICIAN BIOGRAPHIES
serious illnesses that afflicted Mozart and his older sister, Nannerl, including typhoid fever.
Herr Mozart’s reference to Wolfgang cutting a tooth reminds us that these trips began when
he was the age of a first grader of today.
After his experiences in London, Paris, Rome, Venice, Amsterdam, and other musical
capitals of the time, Salzburg seemed provincial and confining. But when at the age of 17 he
had not been offered a satisfactory position in any large city, Mozart grudgingly entered the
service of the archbishop. He found his duties in Salzburg abhorrent and his treatment by the
archbishop demeaning. Frequent disagreements ensued, culminating in a stormy encounter
in 1781 during which the archbishop released him from service “with a kick on my behind,”
as Mozart reported in a letter.
Mozart spent the rest of his life in Vienna, the capital of the Hapsburg Empire, home of
the Empress Maria Theresa and Emperor Joseph II, and one of Europe’s major cultural centers.
Although he held some minor court appointments, he was one of the first composers to seek
a career as a free agent rather than in the employ of the church or aristocracy. For a few
years he presented a series of very popular and lucrative concerts of his own works, among
them 12 spectacular piano concertos in which he was featured as the soloist. He also received
several commissions to compose operas, among them Marriage of Figaro and Don Giovanni,
which premiered in Prague in1786 and 1787, respectively. But Mozart’s success was sporadic
and short-lived. He died at age 35 and was buried in a common grave, his impoverished
circumstances due in part to his extravagant tastes and inability to manage his finances. In
retrospect he also emerges as a tragic casualty of a society in transition, a man too proud and
conscious of his own genius to abase himself in the service of the ruling class, yet too profound
a musical thinker to be appreciated by the new bourgeois audience.
Mozart was an extraordinarily prolific composer, creating enduring works in virtually
every genre of his day—operas, symphonies, piano sonatas, chamber music, works for the
Roman Catholic Church. As a composer of the classical period, the ideals of clarity and
balance inform Mozart’s music, from his early piano pieces written at age six and seven
through his great opera The Magic Flute and the unfinished Requiem Mass from the last year
of his life. What sets him apart from his contemporaries is the mastery of counterpoint,
intensity of developmental processes, expressive power, and sophisticated orchestration that
characterize works written during Mozart’s decade in Vienna. This maturing and deepening
of his compositional craft, while also creating works that would be accessible, seems to have
been a conscious pursuit. As he wrote to his father in 1782:
These concertos are a happy medium between what is too easy and too difficult. They are very
brilliant, pleasing to the ear, and natural, without being vapid. There are passages here and
there from which connoisseurs alone can derive satisfaction; but these passages are written in
such a way that the less learned cannot fail to be pleased, though without knowing why.

Two hundred and fifty years after his birth, Mozart’s works remain staples of the concert
repertory of artists and ensembles all over the world.
Parker, Charlie “Yardbird” or “Bird” (1920–1955)
Though his life was brief and often tragic (he died at the same age as Mozart), Parker made
a profound impact on jazz that is still felt today. In fact, Parker and Louis Armstrong are
probably the most significant and influential figures in all of jazz history. Born in Kansas
City, Missouri, he started playing alto saxophone at age 13, and played around his hometown
for several years until taking a brief trip to New York in 1939. From 1940 to 1942, he toured
with Jay McShann’s band and made several recordings. He also participated in informal jam
sessions at Minton’s in Harlem and other New York jazz clubs, helping to create the music
that would become known as “bebop.” In 1945 he participated in some important recording

MUSICIAN BIOGRAPHIES
sessions with fellow bebop musician trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie. His most influential and
productive years were from 1947 to 1951, when he performed extensively and made dozens of
recordings that have become indispensable jazz classics. Plagued by years of drug and alcohol
abuse, Parker died just a week after his final performance at Birdland, a club named in his
honor. As a composer of many tunes that have become jazz standards, Parker’s harmonic
inventiveness and rhythmic sophistication have influenced legions of jazz musicians. His
nickname, according to McShann, came from an incident while on tour, when the band’s bus
hit a chicken (or “yardbird”) that Parker insisted on having cooked up by their host. But the
moniker, especially in its shorter form “Bird,” seemed to fit Parker and his flights of musical
brilliance perfectly.
Piazzolla, Astor (1921-1992)
Piazzolla was world-famous as a composer, bandleader, and virtuoso of the bandoneón, a
type of 38-key accordion considered one of the crucial instruments of the traditional tango
ensemble. A child prodigy, Piazzolla was born in Argentina, but his family emigrated to
the US in 1924. Thirteen years later they returned to their homeland, where Piazzolla made
arrangements for some of Argentina’s most popular bandleaders and studied classical music
with the great Argentine composer Alberto Ginastera. In 1944 Piazzolla formed his own
band, which featured primarily his own compositions. In 1954 he went to Paris to study with
legendary teacher Nadia Boulanger, who felt his tango compositions showed great promise.
He returned to Argentina, and for the next twenty years worked with his own tango groups.
In 1974 he returned to Paris. Piazzolla’s distinctive music became known as nuevo tango
(“new tango”) and was at first widely criticized by those who felt he had abandoned some of
the important traits of the nearly century-old tango tradition. However, he was later widely
viewed as responsible for tango’s renewed international popularity, as the music’s audience
had declined sharply in the 1950s and 60s. In the 1980s, his works were featured by important
classical performance groups, including the Kronos Quartet. At the time of his death he was at
work on an opera about the life of Carlos Gardel, a hugely popular tango singer of the 1920s
and 30s. He composed about 750 works, including a symphony, a concerto for bandoneón,
and a sonata for the great Russian cellist Mstislav Rostropovich.
Presley, Elvis (1935–1977)
Known around the world as “the King of Rock and Roll,” Elvis Aaron Presley was born in Tupelo,
Mississippi, the son of a poor white truck driver. Presley and his family moved to Memphis
in 1948, where he was exposed to both white country and black R&B and gospel music. In
1954, the year after he graduated high school, he made his first recordings at Sam Philip’s
now legendary Sun Studios on Union Avenue in Memphis. Philips had recorded both white
country singers and black blues singes, but in Presley he discovered a young white man who
had exceptional feel for the black music, as demonstrated on his early blues covers “That’s All
Right Mama” (original by Arthur Crudup), “Good Rockin’ Tonight” (original by Roy Brown),
and “Mystery Train” (original by Jr. Parker). Accompanied by the twangy electric guitar of
Scotty Moore and bouncing bass of Bill Black, Presley’s sound was dubbed “rockabilly” by
early critics in deference to his hillbilly roots and his ability to rock the blues.
Presley appeared on the Grand Ole Opry and the Louisiana Hayride live radio shows,
but it was not until Philips sold his contract to the major record label RCA that Presley would
become a teen idol and national star. In 1956 and 1957 he recorded over a dozen hit songs,
with “All Shook Up,” “Hound Dog,” “Teddy Bear,” “Jailhouse Rock,” and “Don’t be Cruel”
charting number one on the pop, country, and R&B charts. His appearances on the popular
TV shows Milton Berle, Steve Allen, and Ed Sullivan shows brought him further fame and
earned him the title “Elvis the Pelvis” due to his sexually suggestive dancing. In 1958 Elvis
entered the army, and after completing a two-year commitment returned to the United States

85

86

MUSICIAN BIOGRAPHIES
to continue to record and pursue a career in the Hollywood. He died in his Memphis home
in Graceland in 1977, the victim of drug abuse.
Presley’s early Sun and RCA recordings are considered by many critics to be the
pioneering sounds of rock and roll. Presley was the first white pop singer to popularize black
rhythm and blues, and in doing so he opened the door for innumerable young white artists
to become rock and roll singers. His success demonstrated the tremendous allure black R&B
held for the baby boomer generation, and the willingness for white musicians to embrace and
at times exploit black music.
Puccini, Giacomo (1858–1924)
Giacomo Puccini was born in Lucca, Italy, into a family whose members had been prominent
musicians, mostly church organists, for several generations. He was not a child prodigy and
his early musical studies gave little promise that he would fulfill his mother’s ambition that
he follow in the family tradition. The turning point was apparently attending a performance
of Verdi’s Aida when he was 18, after which he decided to devote himself to opera. For three
years, 1880 to 1883, he studied seriously at the Milan Conservatory, but his early works were
failures with audiences and critics and have not remained in the repertory. His third opera,
Manon Lescaut of 1893, was a triumph and demonstrated the extraordinary sense of theater
that was to characterize the six other full-length and three one-act operas he completed over
the course of his life.
Puccini was drawn to stories of passionate relationships set in exotic locations. His
reputation rests largely on three operas: La Boheme (1896) that takes place around 1830 in
the Latin Quarter of Paris, Tosca (1900) in several historic sites in Rome, and Madame Butterfly
(1904) on a hillside overlooking Nagasaki, Japan. Puccini’s last opera, Turandot, is set during
a legendary time in Peking (Beijing), China. Puccini, a chain smoker, developed throat cancer
and died while he was working on the final scene, which was completed by another composer.
At its premiere in 1926 in Milan, at the point in the score where Puccini had stopped working,
the conductor, Arturo Toscanini, stopped the performance, turned to the audience and said,
“Here the opera finishes, because at this point the Maestro died.”
The power of Puccini’s scores lies in his gift for writing music that evokes and intensifies
the passions and atmosphere of each dramatic situation. A particularly effective device is
recalling music associated with earlier moments in the story, but now heard in the new context
of the evolving drama. His poetic imagination is also apparent in lush harmonic language
and sensuous orchestration. Expressive melody is continuous, either sung in soaring arias
that climax at the top of the singer’s range or shifted to the orchestra during passages of vocal
recitative. Puccini roles require singers with tremendous vocal strength, technical virtuosity,
and emotional projection.
Reich, Steve (b. 1936)
Steve Reich was born in New York City. His early musical studies were lessons on piano and
percussion. He graduated with honors in philosophy from Cornell University in 1957 and
subsequently studied composition at The Juilliard School in Manhattan and at Mills College in
California. While on the West Coast, he developed an interest in electronic music, jazz, African
drumming, and the Balinese gamelan, the percussion ensemble of Bali and other Indonesian
islands. In 1966 he founded the New York–based ensemble, Steve Reich and Musicians, devoted
exclusively to the performance of his own music. In the 1970s, he studied drumming with a
master drummer of the Ewe tribe at the Institute of African Studies in Ghana, and Balinese
gamelan music at the Center for World Music in Berkeley, California. More recently he has
pursued an interest in traditional forms of cantillation of the Hebrew Scriptures.
Reich first became known as a leading exponent of musical minimalism, a movement
of the 1970s that grew out of a predilection for extreme simplification in painting and sculpture

MUSICIAN BIOGRAPHIES
in the 1960s. Minimalism was to some extent a reaction against serialism and other complex
and highly intellectual theories of composition. In developing compositional techniques and
formulating an aesthetic for their new musical language, minimalist composers looked to
popular music and non-Western cultures, in Reich’s case, to Africa and the islands of Indonesia.
In his own words, “I studied Balinese and African music because I love them and also because
I believe that non-Western music is presently the single most important source of new ideas
for Western composers and musicians.” While in Ghana, he was introduced to a structural
concept of the “timeline,” a basic rhythm over which other musicians play repeated rhythmic
patterns, with the most complex performed by the group leader or master drummer. The
essential organization is thus polyrhythmic, the simultaneous performance of independent
repeated patterns resulting in a complex interplay of rhythmic layers.
The materials of minimalist composers are short melodic, rhythmic, and harmonic
patterns. Reich’s musical materials may be originally composed, or samples from recorded
speech and urban sounds. A taped phrase of a street vendor, for example, supplies the main
musical idea of Check it out, one of the five movements of City Life.
Whether original or borrowed, patterns are repeated and gradually transformed over
musical spans ranging from a few minutes to a half hour or more. Through a technique called
phasing, a pattern gradually moves out of sync with itself, becoming its own counterpoint.
The rate of change in minimalist music is slow, creating a hypnotic effect that reflects the
influence of Eastern mysticism and practices of meditation embraced by Reich and other
minimalist composers.
Schoenberg, Arnold (1874–1951)
Arnold Schoenberg was born in Vienna. He did not come from a musical family and was
largely self-taught in music, learning the violin and cello without benefit of study with a good
teacher. His formal education ended when financial circumstances following the death of
his father forced him to take a job as a bank clerk, but he continued to pursue his interests
in literature, philosophy, and music on his own. Schoenberg was drawn to the ferment that
characterized artistic and intellectual movements around the turn of the century and allied
himself with the Viennese avant-garde. His first compositions are clearly indebted to late
romantic influences, but a more personal style, characterized by extreme chromaticism and
polyphonic complexity, emerged in an outpouring of works written in his thirties. Between
1915 and 1923, Schoenberg stopped composing, devoting himself to the formulation of his
twelve-tone theory of composition on which all of his works after 1923 are based. In 1925 he
was appointed a professor of composition at the Berlin Academy of Arts, which provided a
supportive environment for experimental art. This situation changed radically when Hitler
came to power in 1933. Schoenberg, vulnerable to persecution as an artist and because of his
Jewish background, emigrated with his family from Germany, landing first in Great Brittan
and eventually immigrating to the United States. He taught at the University of California at
Los Angeles until his retirement in 1944, and continued to compose until his death.
Since medieval times, Western music theory had been based on the concept of a key
center, or tonic, in melodies and harmonies, and on the distinction between consonance and
dissonance in the relationship between voices in music of two or more parts. These are seminal
principles that form the underpinnings of the religious music of the Renaissance, the fugues
and cantatas of Bach, the symphonies of Beethoven, the operas of Mozart and Verdi, and other
masterpieces of Western art music. At the end of the 19th century, however, there was a sense
among progressive musicians that the major/minor system and the compositional procedures
and forms it had produced had run their course. It was in this atmosphere of searching for
alternative approaches that Schoenberg came up with a new theory of composition. Perhaps
his lack of formal training in a discipline where complex problems of form, counterpoint and
harmony, instrumentation, and notation have traditionally required years of study with a
master freed him to think outside established conventions. In any case, Schoenberg’s “method

87

88

MUSICIAN BIOGRAPHIES
of composing with twelve tones” was a radical departure from traditional compositional
procedures. Central to the method is his revolutionary idea that all twelve tones into which
the octave is divided in Western music should be treated as equal. In other words, no tone
would dominate as a tonic. The composition of a work according to Schoenberg’s method
begins with the creation of a tone row containing all twelve pitches. This row is the germinal
cell from which all melodic, harmonic, and contrapuntal materials are derived. The principles
for configuring a tone row and the complex ways it can be manipulated are formulated
in Schoenberg’s theoretical writings. Because of the absence of a key center, twelve-tone
music is often called “atonal,” a term to which Schoenberg objected, or “serial” because the
compositional technique involves manipulation of a tone row, or series.
While twelve-tone describes Schoenberg’s compositional procedure, his style is
classified as expressionist. Expressionism was an early 20th-century movement that sought
to reveal through art the irrational, subconscious reality and repressed primordial impulses
postulated and analyzed in the writings of Freud. Rather than depict impressions received
from the outer world, painters such as Wassily Kandinsky, Oskar Kokoschka, Edvard Munch,
and Max Beckmann, and writers such as August Strindberg, Frank Wedekind, Stefan George,
and Franz Kafka explored the shadowy and distorted images, hallucinatory visions, and
irrational terrors of the subconscious. Hysteria, isolation and alienation, the grotesque and
macabre were favorite subjects of Expressionist artists. Schoenberg himself took up painting
in 1908 and, over the course of his life, created imaginatively intense if technically amateurish
pictures, including several self-portraits. In the music of Schoenberg and other Expressionist
composers, relentless emotional intensity is attributable to jagged, highly disjunct melodic
lines; instruments in extreme ranges; unresolved tension through avoidance of consonant
sonorities; texts dealing with violence and abnormal behavior; and exaggeration and distortion
of the natural accents of speech.
Schoenberg applied the twelve-tone technique to every type of genre to which he
contributed—opera; choral and solo vocal; orchestral, chamber and keyboard. His music,
never readily accessible or easy to listen to, has always aroused controversy, even hostility,
on both aesthetic and intellectual grounds. He was drawn to subjects and forms of expression
that resonated with a devoted, if small, following, and he never sought to entertain or gain
popularity with a wide public. In his own words:
There are relatively few people who are capable of understanding, purely musically,
what music has to say. Such trained listeners have probably never been very numerous, but
that does not prevent the artist from creating only for them. Great art presupposes the alert
mind of the educated listener.
Schubert, Franz (1797–1828)
Franz Schubert received his earliest musical education from his father, a schoolmaster in a
village outside Vienna, followed by formal study at a music school in Vienna and composition
lessons with the composer Antonio Salieri (depicted as Mozart’s rival in the play and movie
Amadeus). For a brief period he taught at his father’s school, but from the age of 18 to his
death at 31, he was plagued by illness and poverty. Except for a few published piano pieces
and songs for which he was miserably paid, his works had been heard by only a small group of
friends and admirers and his genius was almost totally unrecognized for some time. Schubert
produced a phenomenal number of works, from symphonies, operas, and church music to
chamber works, piano pieces, and songs written for performance in the homes of the growing
middle class. As he observed about himself, “I write all day and when I have finished one
piece, I begin another.”
Schubert was particularly successful in small, intimate forms, notably his piano
pieces with such titles as Moment Musicale (musical moment) and impromptu, and his songs.
He is considered to be the father of the art song, a composition for voice and instrumental
accompaniment (most often piano) that flowered during the Romantic period. Unlike folk

MUSICIAN BIOGRAPHIES
songs, which are passed on through oral tradition and usually of unknown authorship, art
songs are notated (written down) songs in which a composer consciously seeks to develop
expressive connections between poetry and music. The lyric poetry of Goethe, Schiller, and
Heine in the late 18th century provided a rich source of texts for the outpouring of German
art song in the 19th century. The concept of the art song was not Schubert’s invention, but his
over 600 songs demonstrate a facility for penetrating to the essence of a poem and forcefully
enhancing its meaning and images that was unprecedented. He responded immediately and
intuitively to poetry, often writing a song from start to finish in an afternoon. There is a story
of friends leaving a poem lying out on a table for the unsuspecting to Schubert to happen
upon, and returning a few hours later to discover it transformed into a completed song.
Schumann, Clara Wieck (1819-1896)
Clara Wieck Schumann is one of a small number of women prior to the second half of the
20th century whose musical activities included composition, a reflection of the relatively
subordinate role women composers have played in the history of concert hall music. That
their creative output has been less than that of men with respect to both quantity and quality
is attributable to a number of factors, chiefly attitudes regarding women’s appropriate role in
society, presumptions about their inherent intellectual and emotional capacities, their lack
of access of education and training, their financial dependence on men, and the exclusion of
women from many forms of musical activity. The following assessment appeared in an 1891
article in Women’s Journal:
It is probably true that more women than men have received musical instruction of a sort, but
not of the sort which qualifies anyone to become a composer. Girls are as a rule taught music
superficially, simply as an accomplishment. To enable them to play and sing agreeably is the
whole object of their music lessons. It is exceedingly rare that a girl’s father cares to have her
taught the underlying laws of harmony or the principles of musical composition.
In Germany and Italy, the countries where the greatest musical composers have originated, the
standard of women’s education is especially low and the idea of woman’s sphere particularly
restricted. The German or Italian girl who should confess an ambition to become a composer
would be regarded by her friends as out of her sphere, if not out of her mind.
When women have had for several centuries the same advantages of liberty, education, and social
encouragement in the use of their brains that men have, it will be right to argue their mental
inferiority if they have not produced their fair share of geniuses. But it is hardly reasonable to
expect women during a few years of liberty and half education to produce at once specimens
of genius equal to the choicest men of all the ages.

Unlike most women of her day, Clara Wieck Schumann was carefully trained from the
age of five as a pianist and musician by her father, Friedrick Wieck. In other areas, including
the so-called feminine arts of sewing, knitting, or crocheting, her education was meager. She
made her public debut in 1828, at age nine; the same year she met Robert Schumann, her
future husband, who was then eighteen. Robert was to become one of the leading composers
associated with musical romanticism. Between 1828 and 1838 Clara launched a highly
promising career, and her friendship with Robert deepened into love. Her father vehemently
opposed their relationship and, hoping to reassert his control, sent 19-year-old Clara to Paris
with a total stranger as a chaperone. To his astonishment, and probably her own as well, she

89

90

MUSICIAN BIOGRAPHIES
dismissed the chaperone and managed to support herself in the strange city. She presented
herself to the French public through successful concerts she arranged, and she found students,
composed music, and had her works published. Even today we would find this remarkable,
but in 1839 it was an amazing act of courage, especially for a woman.
Schumann was considered the foremost woman pianist of her day and a peer of
contemporary male virtuosi. Her concert programs and her high musical standards changed
the character of the solo piano recital in the 19th century. She introduced much new music
by her husband, and by Chopin and Brahms, and she was also distinguished as being the first
pianist to perform many of Beethoven’s sonatas in public. At the end of her long career, she
had played over 1,300 public programs in England and Europe. Clara’s training in composition
was also excellent. Her compositions were published, performed and reviewed favorably during
her lifetime, and she was encouraged by both her father and her husband.
Clara’s marriage to Robert Schumann took place the day before her twenty-first birthday
in 1840, after a lawsuit the couple brought against Wieck was decided in their favor. Both before
and after her marriage, she wrote chiefly piano works and songs, genres considered appropriate
for female creative expression since such works were intended primarily for performance in
the home. Her output was also small, undoubtedly because of her hectic performing schedule
and domestic responsibilities associated with raising eight children. With the exception of
one work, Clara ceased composing after her husband’s death in 1856.
Much of what is known about Clara’s personal life after her marriage is found in her
diaries, in her joint diaries with Robert, and in her letters. It is clear that, while she felt confident
of her powers as a performer, she had ambivalent feelings toward her ability and skill as a
composer. Comments such as the following from her 1839 diary reflect the prevailing notion
of the time that women were unfit by nature for intellectual pursuits and limited to manners
of expression which were inherently feminine in character.
I once thought I possessed creative talent, but have given up this idea. A woman must not
desire to compose – not one has been able to do it, and why should I expect to? It would be
arrogance, although indeed, my father led me into it in earlier days.

Clara never intended to give up her concert career after her marriage, and Robert never
seriously suggested it. Despite his desire for a quiet home and a woman to look after him
and their children, he was aware of his wife’s needs as an artist and his attitude toward her
career was, for a man of his time, unusually enlightened and supportive. Clara’s letters and
diary entries indicate she recognized her importance as a pianist and considered herself first
an artist and only afterward a parent. The conflicts between public concertizing and raising a
family intensified in 1854 when Robert, suffering from mental illness and depression, entered a
sanitarium where he died two years later. Clara was pregnant at the time he became terminally
ill, and soon after the birth of their eighth child, she set out on the first of many concert tours
that were to become a regular feature of her life for more than 30 years. She now bore the
entire responsibility of providing for a large family. But she also seems to have felt a need for
artistic self-expression, which she sought in performing. She may also have found comfort in
bringing her husband’s music to the attention of the public. As she wrote to a friend:
You regard them [the concert tours] merely as a means of earning money. I do not. I feel I have
a mission to reproduce beautiful works, Robert’s above all, as long as I have the strength to do
so, and even if I were not absolutely compelled to do so I should go on touring, though not in
such a strenuous way as I often have to now. The practice of my art is definitely an important
part of my being. It is the very air I breathe.

MUSICIAN BIOGRAPHIES
Seeger, Pete (b. 1919)
New York City–born Pete Seeger is undoubtedly the most well-known and influential figure
of the mid-20th century urban folk song revival. The son of the erudite musicologist Charles
Seeger and a professional violinist Constance de Clyver Edison, Seeger was educated at elite
New England boarding schools before entering Harvard University where he joined John
Fitzgerald Kennedy as a member of the class of 1940. But two years later he dropped out of
college and moved to New York City in hopes of pursuing a career in journalism.
Seeger had begun playing the four-string banjo in a high school Dixieland jazz combo,
but his interests shifted toward folk music after attending the Asheville, North Carolina folk
festival in 1936 with his father. Charles, who was beginning to study and promote folk music
through his position with the federal Resettlement Administration, introduced Pete to the
famous folk music collector Alan Lomax, who offered him a temporary position working at
the Library of Congress Archive of American Folk Music. There Seeger immersed himself in
recordings of traditional Anglo and Afro American folk music and began teaching himself to
play the guitar and five-string banjo.
Seeger relocated in New York City in the early 1940s where he sang with Woody Guthrie
and Huddie “Lead Belly” Ledbetter in the burgeoning urban folk music revival. He helped
found the Almanac singers in 1941, a loosely knit group of left-leaning folk singers and political
activists who sought to use folk music to promote union and other progressive causes. In the
1950s he organized the Weavers, a more professional sounding folk ensemble whose 1950
recording of the Lead Belly song “Goodnight Irene” brought folk music to the popular music
charts. Throughout the 1950s and early 1960s Seeger’s solo concerts and recordings for Folkways
Records put urban American audiences in touch with the rich heritage of traditional American
ballads, blues, work songs, and spirituals. Seeger encouraged thousands of young people to
pick up guitars and banjos and to discover American folk music. He also demonstrated that
new folk songs could be written using traditional forms and instruments, as he authored or
coauthored well-known anthems of the folk revival including “We Shall Overcome,” “If I Had
a Hammer,” “Turn, Turn, Turn,” and “Where Have all the Flowers Gone.”
Seeger was devoted to using folk music to promote progressive political causes. His
socialist leaning made him a victim of McCarthy blacklisting in the 1950s, and in the 1960s
he emerged as a prominent voice in the civil rights, anti-war, and environmental movements.
Today, in his late eighties, Pete Seeger remains an outspoken critic and controversial figure,
beloved to old leftists and young progressives who see him as the “voice of the people,” and
reviled by conservatives who dismiss him and other urban folk singers as hypocritical leftist
phonies.
Seeger, Ruth Crawford (1901–1953)
Composer and folk music transcriber Ruth Crawford was born in East Liverpool, Ohio. She
studied piano as a child in Florida, and in 1921 moved to Chicago to study at the American
Conservatory of Music. In Chicago, she became a friend of the poet Carl Sandburg and taught
piano to his three daughters. Her work in arranging folk songs began with her association
with Sandburg, to whose collection The American Songbag (1927) she contributed several
exceptional piano arrangements.
Crawford’s compositions impressed the composer Henry Cowell who generously assisted
her professional career. He recommended her as a pupil to his friend Charles Seeger, a noted
pedagogue, theorist, and philosopher of music, published several of her compositions in his
influential New Music Quarterly, and helped her obtain a Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship.
Crawford moved to New York in 1929, and became a vital participant in the “ultra-modern”
school of composition, a group of composers that included Aaron Copland, Henry Cowell,
Marc Blitzstein, and Earl Robinson. Through her studies with Seeger, Crawford became
increasingly interested in linear writing and “dissonant counterpoint,” a 20th-century approach

91

92

MUSICIAN BIOGRAPHIES
to counterpoint that turned traditional contrapuntal rules on their head. Her best-known
work is the String Quartet 1931, a striking example of modernist musical experimentation,
which established her brilliant and inventive musical mind.
Crawford and Seeger married in 1932, and their first child, Michael, was born in
1933. After the birth of Peggy, their first daughter, in 1935, the Seeger family moved to
Washington, DC, so that Charles could begin a position as a music specialist with the federal
government’s recently created Resettlement Administration. With four children in all (Mike,
Peggy, Barbara, and Penny) to raise and a demanding schedule of teaching piano, Crawford
stopped composing ultra-modern music, and turned to the work of teaching music to children
and of collecting, transcribing, arranging, and publishing folk songs. Her three volumes of
children’s folk songs—American Folk Songs for Children (1948), Animal Folk Songs for Children
(1950), and American Folk Songs for Christmas (1953)—helped introduce a generation of young
Americans to folk music and fueled the urban folk revival of the late 1950s and early 1960s.
Her son Mike, daughter Peggy, and stepson Pete would be major figures in that movement.
Shankar, Ravi (b. 1920)
Music from the Indian subcontinent is one of the non-Western repertories that has fascinated
Western musicians and audiences in recent decades. One of its principal exponents has been
the great sitarist Ravi Shankar. As a child he exhibited unusual gifts as both a dancer and a
musician, but during his mid-teens began to focus on mastering the sitar. For years he studied
as the discipline of a prominent guru, ultimately receiving the blessing of his teacher. His
first tour outside India was to the Soviet Union in 1954. During the 1960s he became well
known to Western audiences through his many tours and recordings. He has often performed
for humanitarian causes, such as the 1958 UNESCO concert in Paris, the United Nations
Human Rights Day concert in New York in 1967, and fund-raising events for Bangladesh.
The 1971 “Concert for Bangladesh” with the Beatle George Harrison is available on CD and
DVD. Harrison studied with Shankar, and their friendship led to Shankar’s appearances at
the Monterey Pop and Woodstock festivals.
Shankar is an undisputed master of the purest classical style of Indian music. He is
also a composer and teacher. In his writings on music, he refers frequently to the spiritual
dimension of Indian music, a system that “can be traced back nearly two thousand years to its
origin in the Vedic hymns of the Hindu temples, the fundamental source of all Indian music.
Thus, as in Western music, the roots of Indian classical music are religious. To us, music can
be a spiritual discipline on the path to self-realisation, for we follow the traditional teaching
that sound is God—Nada Brahma. By this process individual consciousness can be elevated to
the realm of awareness where the revelation of the true meaning of the universe—its eternal
and unchanging essence—can be joyfully experienced. Our ragas are the vehicles by which
the essence can be perceived.” He describes the experience of performing as one in which he
infuses the “breath of life into a raga” and “each note pulses with life and the raga becomes
vibrant and incandescent.”
Shankar has also crossed the boundaries of traditional Indian music. The experimental
side of his career is illustrated by his appearances with George Harrison of the Beatles and
three recordings from the early 1970s—one of classical North Indian music with American
violinist Yedudi Menuhin, another with Japanese musicians, and a third his Concerto for Sitar
and Orchestra. Shankar has composed works for All-India Radio’s instrumental ensemble
and scores for ballets and films, including Gandhi and the Apu Trilogy. Shankar has exerted
formative influence on Western musicians speaking a broad range of musical dialects, from
the minimalist composer Philip Glass to pop groups such as the Beatles, Rolling Stones, and
Traffic. His honors include membership in the American Academy of Arts and Letters and of
the United Nations International Rostrum of Composers. His discography totals almost 70
albums and he currently holds the Guinness record for the longest international career in
music. In recent years, Shankar has toured and recorded with his daughter, Anoushka, who
also plays sitar. Another daughter is the pop musician Norah Jones.

Smith, Bessie (1894-1937)
Smith was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee. By the age of 14 she had become the protégé of
the blues singer Ma Rainey and began performing in minstrel shows, cabarets, and vaudeville.
Her tours and recordings during the 1920s brought blues to a wide audience and made her
the best-known black artist of her day—the “Empress of the Blues.” Her vocal style, which
has been immortalized in 160 recorded selections, is characterized by expressive alterations
of melody and rhythm, slurred intonation, blue-note inflections, and raspy, growling tonecolor effects. She performed with many of the jazz greats, including Benny Goodman, Louis
Armstrong, and James P. Johnson. Her commercial popularity declined along with that of the
blues in the early 1930s. She died following a car accident near Clarksdale, Mississippi.
Stravinsky, Igor (1882–1971)
Igor Stravinsky, probably the most influential European-born composer of the 20th century,
was born outside Leningrad. His father was a bass singer at the Russian Imperial Opera, but
Stravinsky was encouraged to pursue a career as a government lawyer, studying music on an
amateur level. However, with the encouragement of his teachers, when he was 20 he began
to study composition seriously. By the time he was 30, two brilliant and audacious works, The
Fire Bird and Petrushka, had thrust him into the forefront of the modernist movement. Both
were ballet scores commissioned by Sergei Diaghilev, director of one of the most important
ballet companies of the early 20th century, the Paris-based Ballet Russe (Russian Ballet).
From 1911 to 1939, Stravinsky resided principally in France and Switzerland, touring
Europe as a pianist and conductor of his own works. His third collaboration with Diaghilev,
The Rite of Spring (Le Sacre de Printemps), provoked a near riot at its premiere in 1913. The
choice of subject, a pagan ritual in which a virgin is sacrificed to propitiate the gods, reflects
a fascination with “primitive” or preliterate cultures that also inspired Picasso’s collection of
African sculpture and influenced the development of the Cubist style in art. This was also the
period of Freud’s writings about the fundamentally savage impulses of human nature. The raw
sensuality and hypnotic musical repetition, paralleled by compulsively repeated choreographic
movements, were among the features found offensive by members of the audience. One critic
expressed the opinion that the work “constituted a blasphemous attempt to destroy music as
an art.” Others characterized it as “stupifying,” “haunting,” “a beautiful nightmare.” Almost
a century after its composition, Rite of Spring no longer stirs such impassioned controversy
but continues to arrest listeners with the elemental power of the musical materials and the
overwhelming force of their expression. One section of Fantasia, the pioneering 1940 animated
film from the Disney Studios, is based on the score of TheRite of Spring.
In 1939, at the outbreak of World War II, Stravinsky was presenting a series of lectures
at Harvard. Rather than return to Europe, he decided to settle in the United States, where he
remained until his death. Over his long life, he completed a huge body of work encompassing
virtually every musical genre—opera, ballet, symphony, concerto, choral, chamber. T. S.Eliot,
Charlie Chaplin, and Pablo Picasso, who sketched a famous portrait of Stravinsky while
sitting at a Paris café, were among his friends. He collaborated with many leading artists of
his time, including Vaslav Nijinsky, George Balanchine, Jean Cocteau, Andre Gide, and W. H.
Auden. He had an affair with Coco Chanel, gave autographs to Sinatra and the pope, and
was honored at a White House dinner given by the Kennedys (whom he called “nice kids”).
Like Pablo Picasso, Stravinsky went through different stylistic periods during which his
works reflect a variety of past and contemporary traditions, most importantly the folk and
classical music of his native Russia, the compositional practices of Bach and Mozart, jazz,
and the serial technique of Arnold Schoenberg. Stravinsky seems to have been conscious of
how seminal such influences had been on his evolution as a composer. When in 1969 he was
asked to explain why, at age 87, he was moving from Los Angeles to New York, he replied, “to
mutate faster.”

MUSICIAN BIOGRAPHIES
Varèse, Edgard (1883–1965)
Edgard Varèse was born in Paris. His initial training was in math and engineering, but in
1903, over the objections of his family, he began serious musical studies in Paris and Berlin.
None of his works from this period survive, although by 1915, when he moved to New York,
he had acquired notoriety as a boldly original composer and thinker. In New York, Varèse
became a leading advocate for new music, organizing concerts and founding the International
Composers’ Guild, the New Symphony Orchestra, and the Pan American Association of
Composers. He considered the United States to be a place “symbolic of discoveries—new worlds
on earth, in the sky, or in the minds of men.”
Varèse was fascinated by the timbral aspect of music. In a 1915 interview he stated:
“I refuse to submit myself only to sounds that have already been heard. What I am looking
for are new technical mediums which can lend themselves to every expression of thought and
can keep up with thought.” He defined music as “organized sound” and asserted “the right to
make music with any and all sounds,” even those considered to be “noise.” He often tried to
persuade scientists and technicians to help him invent new instruments, and actively sought
funding for such research.
Varèse’s compositional output was small—twelve completed works and a handful of
unfinished projects. But no two works are alike, each representing a unique solution in his
search for ways to achieve the “liberation of sound.” For example, Ionisation (1931) is scored
entirely for percussion instruments, which until the early 20th century were used primarily
in orchestral music for rhythmic emphasis and dramatic or coloristic effects, such as cymbal
crashes. In addition to a huge array of traditional orchestral percussion, Varèse’s score calls
for instruments of non-Western origin as well as chains, sirens, and anvils. The piece unfolds
as a succession of contrasting blocks and masses of sound. The title “ionization” suggests
a connection between the interaction of electronically charged atoms or groups of atoms
studied in physics and Varèse’s concept of music as “moving bodies of sound in space.” For
his Poeme Electronique, Varèse recorded bells, sirens, the human voice, and other sounds which
he manipulated electronically, created other sounds in a studio, and assembled them onto an
8-minute tape that played inside a futuristic building designed by the architect Le Corbusier
for the Philips Pavilion at the 1958 Brussels Worlds Fair.
Verdi, Giuseppe (1813–1901)
Giuseppe Verdi was born in a village near Parma that, like the rest of northern Italy, was
under Austrian control. His musical experiences up through his mid-twenties occurred close
to home—early lessons with a local musician, church organist job at age 9, further private
study after being denied admission to the Conservatory at Milan, a job giving instrumental
and vocal lessons. A turning point in his life occurred in 1939 with the enthusiastic reception
of his first opera, Oberto, in Milan. This led to a commission for three more operas, one of
which, Nabucco, was produced in several major European cities and in New York in the 1840s.
Once an obscure provincial musician, Verdi had achieved the international celebrity that he
was to enjoy for the rest of his life, almost exclusively for his operas. Although openly critical
of the Roman Catholic Church, he also composed several settings of religious texts.
Verdi’s career coincides almost exactly with the Risorgimento, the nationalist movement
that he passionately supported and that culminated with the unification of Italy under King
Victor Emmanuele in 1861. Although the scenes and characters in Verdi’s operas have no
direct connection to contemporary events in Italy, the stories of tyranny, conspiracy, political
assassination, and suppression of individual and national liberties struck a chord with the
Italian public. The slogan of the unification movement became VIVA, VERDI, the letters of the
composer’s name standing for Vittorio Emanuele, Re di Italia (Victor Emmanuele, King of Italy).
Toward the end of Verdi’s life, opera was developing in new directions under the influence of
German and younger Italian composers, but he was still beloved by his countrymen. The

MUSICIAN BIOGRAPHIES
route of his burial procession in Milan was said to have been lined by as many as 200,000
people and an estimated 300,000 attended the official memorial service.
Almost 20 of Verdi’s operas are staples of the romantic repertory today, among them
Macbeth, Rigoletto, Il Trovatore, La Traviata, Un Ballo in Maschera, La Forza del Destino, Don Carlos,
Aida and, from late in his life, Otello and Falstaff. With the exception of his first and last operas,
which are comic, Verdi was drawn to passionate, eventful stories that are dark, violent, and
end with the death of one or more major characters. In his words, “I want subjects that are
novel, big, beautiful, varied and bold—as bold as can be.” The librettos of three are based
on Shakespeare, others on Friedrich Schiller, Voltaire, and the romantic writers Victor Hugo,
Lord Byron, and Dumas. Having chosen his subject, Verdi worked closely with his librettists to
construct fast-moving, eventful plots with vividly contrasting emotions. Conflicts between fear,
love, jealousy, fidelity, patriotism create dramatic tension both between and within individual
characters. As the libretto evolved, so did Verdi’s ideas for the powerful melodies, energetic
rhythms, and climactic buildups through which those passions would find musical expression.
In casting his operas, Verdi looked for singers who brought to their roles a combination of
high level of vocal accomplishment and vivid stage presence, qualities that continue to be the
hallmarks of the great interpreters of Verdi today. In the words of the soprano Renata Tebaldi:
“Verdi suffered a great deal through his life and I hear it in his music as the expression of his
own soul. Singers must remember to try and achieve the greatest ‘expressione’ in singing
Verdi to do justice to this great Maestro.”
Vivaldi, Antonio (1678–1741)
Antonio Vivaldi was one of the most prolific and influential composers of the Italian Baroque.
He received his musical education from his father, then at the age of 15 began his training
for the priesthood. In 1703, the year of his ordination , he assumed the position of teacher of
violin at the Pietá, a Venetian home for orphaned, illegitimate, and indigent girls. He spent
most of the rest of his life in Venice, although productions of his operas took him to Rome,
Mantua, Verona, and Prague. At the height of his popularity, his commissions and published
works amassed him considerable wealth, but at the time of his death, in Vienna, he had
become impoverished and was buried in a pauper’s grave.
The list of Vivaldi’s compositions is both large and diverse, encompassing orchestral
and instrumental chamber works, masses and other sacred music, and operas. Of his over 40
operas, more than half have been lost and none are part of the standard operatic repertory
today. On the other hand, his concertos, of which over 500 have been preserved, are firmly
established in the instrumental literature. His music has been featured in numerous television
commercials and in the scores of such recent films as The Royal Tenenbaums, Sidewalks of New
York, Being John Malkovich, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Final Cut, and Shine.
Many of Vivaldi’s concertos were written to be played by the more talented of his
students at the Pietá. During one six-year period, from 1723 to 1729, the records of the Pietá
show he was paid for 140 concertos, an astonishing twelve per month. These and other of
his instrumental and sacred works would have been performed by the girls at concerts that
became major events in the social life of the Venetian nobility and foreign visitors.
Vivaldi was a seminal figure in the history of the concerto, especially the violin
concerto. About 200 of his 500 extant concertos are for one violin and another 30 or so for
two or more violins, or violins with other solo instruments. His writing for the violin explores
the instrument’s virtuoso capabilities as well as its capacity to “sing.” He standardized a
three-movement design for the concerto as a whole, in which the fast tempo and animated
character of the first and third contrast with a more lyrical and expressive slow movement in
the middle. Vivaldi also established a formal pattern for the fast movements, called ritornello
form, which involves a systematic alternation of solo and tutti forces. He was a pioneer of
program music, instrumental music that portrays a story, scene, or other nonmusical subject.
The most famous of his programmatic works is The Four Seasons, a collection of four violin
concertos, one devoted to each of the four seasons of the year.

APPENDIX 2: GLOSSARY

Note: italicized words are Glossary entries.
Absolute music: instrumental music whose materials and structure have been conceived
without influence from or reference to text, stories, pictures, or other nonmusical sources
or meanings. Sonata, concerto, symphony, and string quartet are among the common titles
assigned by composers to such works. Compare program music.
Accent: emphasis of a note or chord, often through dynamic stress, that is marked increase
in loudness.
Accompaniment: the musical background for a principal part or parts. A musical texture
consisting of melody and accompaniment is classified as homophonic. See Chapter 1: Elements
of Sound and Music.
Aria: a number for solo voice and orchestra most commonly associated with opera and oratorio.
Arias are vehicles through which characters tell us about themselves and express their feelings
and emotions. The text of an aria is often poetic and is set to a highly developed melody.
Words and phrases may be repeated. The orchestra accompanies, but instruments may also
function as wordless characters that counterpoint and converse with the voice.
Art song: notated (written down) musical setting of a text authored by a known composer who
consciously seeks to develop expressive connections between poetry and music. By contrast,
folk songs are usually transmitted by oral tradition and their creators are unknown.
Beat: the regular pulse underlying the unfolding of music in time. The rate at which the beat
occurs is called tempo. See Chapter 1: Elements of Sound and Music.
Blue notes: steps in the scale, usually the third and seventh, that are flattened, that is, slightly
lowered in pitch, in performing blues.
Blues: see Chapter 6: American Vernacular Music.
Brass instrument: see Chapter 2: Musical Instruments and Ensembles.
Bridge: a section that connects two themes, often bringing about a modulation, as in sonata
form. See Chapter 1: Elements of Sound and Music.
Cadence: the termination of a musical statement, analogous to a point of punctuation in
prose. A complete or full cadence is characterized by the finality of a period or exclamation
point at the end of an independent clause while the need for completion of a dependent
clause, denoted by a comma or semicolon in prose, is the musical equivalent of an incomplete
or half cadence.
97

98

GLOSSARY
Cadenza: passage near the end of an aria or concerto movement performed by the soloist
without the orchestra. The material of the cadenza is intended to show off the virtuosity of
the soloist and in some periods was improvised.
Call and response: in jazz, gospel, and other music influenced by African practices, alternation
between two performing entities, most commonly a single performer and a group. See Chapter
6: American Vernacular Music and Chapter 7: Jazz.
Cantata: from the Italian “cantare” to sing, a genre of vocal music based on either a secular or
religious text set as recitatives and arias, and sometimes choruses. Cantatas may have dramatic
qualities but are unstaged and are much shorter than operas and oratorios.
Chamber music: see Chapter 2: Musical Instruments and Ensembles.
Chance music: an approach to creating a unique musical work in which the composer
intentionally relinquishes control over pitches, durations, and other essential musical elements.
The performer(s) determines what will be played and how it will be played by such means as
tossing dice or coins.
Chant: monophonic setting of a sacred text. Chanting by a soloist or a choir in unison is
practiced in many religious traditions, including Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism.
The intoning of sacred texts provides a manner of delivery that is differentiated from ordinary
speech and can heighten the mystery and spiritual atmosphere of religious ritual.
Choir: a choral ensemble, especially one that performs religious music, as in a church choir
or a gospel choir. When applied to instruments, choir is usually synonymous with “section,”
as in woodwind choir, brass choir.
Chord: three or more pitches sounding together that produce harmony.
Chorus: when referring to performers, a chorus is a vocal ensemble. Choruses vary greatly
in size, from chamber-like groups of eight to twelve to a hundred or more singers. The
performance of choral music most commonly requires sopranos, altos, tenors, and basses (see
Chapter 2: Musical Instruments and Ensembles, section on Human Voice as Instrument) but
there is also important choral literature for women, men, children, and boys. The other use
of the word chorus denotes a section of a musical work, either the refrain of a song or, in a
jazz composition, the harmonic/melodic theme and its varied repetitions.
Coda: from the Latin for “tail,” a concluding section added to customary components of
a musical form.
Common practice period: the time in European art music between 1600 and 1900 when
composers spoke, and audiences understood, a common musical language based on tonality
(keys) and standard instrumental forms. The Baroque period began this era with refinements
to the tonal system still in progress, in the Classical period tonal music and instrumental
forms (such as sonata form) reached their highest level of development, and in the Romantic
period these systems broke down as composers began to sacrifice formal purity in exchange
for personal expression in their music.
Concerto: an orchestral work in which the players are divided into two groups, one consisting
of one or more soloists, the other being the full orchestra (called the tutti, meaning all the
players). The term concerto derives from an Italian word that means both to join together in
a cooperative manner and also to contend competitively. Much of the effect of the concerto
derives from the virtuosity of the soloist and from contrasts of dynamics, mass of sound, and
tone color made possible by the division into differently constituted groups.
Conjunct, disjunct: see Chapter 1: Elements of Sound and Music.
Consonance, dissonance: simultaneous pitches that are experienced as pleasing or harmonious
within a particular musical context are described as consonant while those experienced as
harsh or clashing are described as dissonant.

GLOSSARY
Continuo: in Baroque music, both the bass line that provides the harmonic foundation and
the instruments that perform it. At least two players are generally required for the performance
the continuo part: a cellist for the written-out bass line, and a harpsichordist or organist who
plays the bass line with the left hand and improvises harmonies with the right hand. The
continuo section is somewhat analogous to the rhythm section in jazz.
Counterpoint: principles and rules used in composing multi-part music;
adjective, contrapuntal.
Development: in a general sense, the manipulation of musical material through such
procedures as altering the melodic and rhythmic contours of a theme, stating motives derived
from a theme in imitation or repeated at different pitch levels, stating the theme in different
keys, and so on. In a more restricted sense, the section in a sonata form where musical ideas
from the exposition are manipulated and elaborated.
Dissonance: see Consonance.
Downbeat: the first beat in a metric grouping, or measure. Patterns of arm motion used by
the conductor signal the downbeat by a downward movement of the arm.
Dynamics: degrees of loud and soft. Commonly used Italian terms are forte (loud), piano
(soft), crescendo (getting gradually louder), and decrescendo (getting gradually softer). See
Chapter 1: Elements of Sound and Music.
Ensemble: from the French for “together,” a group that performs together. Examples include
an orchestra, band, opera, and chorus as well as groups with ensemble in their title, such as jazz
ensemble, brass ensemble, and new music ensemble. In opera, an ensemble involves three or
more soloists simultaneously singing different words and melodies, each conveying his or her
view of a particular dramatic situation. See Chapter 2: Musical Instruments and Ensembles.
Episode: a passage between statements of a theme or subject, as in a fugue or rondo.
Ethnomusicology: from the Greek “ethno” (culture, people), the scientific study of music of
oral tradition, encompassing tribal and folk music, and of the art music produced by various
world cultures. The discipline, whose origins date back to the 1880s, draws on methodologies
of musicology, the scholarly study of Western art music, and anthropology, whose subject is
mankind and human culture.
Exposition: the section of a work in which the principal thematic material is presented. See
fugue and sonata form.
Experimental music: music where the outcome is unknown until the piece is realized.
Although the term did not exist when Charles Ives was active as a composer, due to his
several musical innovations he is seen today as the father of American experimental music.
Important experimental composers include Henry Cowell, John Cage, Cornelius Cardew,
Annea Lockwood, Meredith Monk, Pauline Oliveros, and Laurie Anderson.
Expressionism: an early 20th-century movement that sought to reveal through art the
irrational, subconscious reality and repressed primordial impulses postulated and analyzed
in the writings of Freud. See Chapter 5: European and American Art Music since 1900.
Extended performance technique: non-traditional performance of an instrument (extended
instrumental technique) or use of the voice (extended vocal technique) in order to extend its
range and/or expand its timbre palette. This term is most often associated with American
experimental music. It should be noted that a non-traditional performance technique in one
culture may be a traditional performance method in another.
Folk song: a song of unknown authorship that has been transmitted through oral tradition
and usually exists in various versions as a result of being passed on over time. Compare art
song. See Chapter 6: American Vernacular Music.

Form: the structural aspect of music concerned with such factors as statement, repetition,
contrast, and development of musical material. See Chapter 1: Elements of Sound and Music.
Front line: the members of a jazz ensemble whose principal function is melodic, in contrast
to the harmonic, rhythmic role of the rhythm section. See Chapter 7: Jazz.
Fugue: title for a polyphonic musical work that is characterized by the development of a theme
or subject through imitation. Most fugues are composed for four “voices,” or independent lines
in the texture, commonly identified by their relative ranges as soprano, alto, tenor, and bass.
In the exposition, or opening section, the theme is presented by one of the voice parts alone and
is then taken up by each of the other voice parts in turn. As each new voice enters, the others
continue with counterpointing material and the texture becomes increasingly dense. In the
entries—subsequent appearances of the theme in one or more voices—the theme may be stated
in new key areas or altered form, for example, with durations of the pitches longer or shorter.
Entries alternate with episodes in which fragments or motives from the theme are developed.
Gamelan: percussion orchestra of Bali, Java, and other Indonesian islands. See Chapter 2:
Musical Instruments and Ensembles.
Gospel music: genre of American religious music. See Chapter 6: American Vernacular Music.
Harmony: the vertical dimension of multi-part music through which simultaneous
combinations of tones produces chords and successions of chords. See Chapter 1: Elements of
Sound and Music.
Heterophony: a variant of monophonic texture; adjective heterophonic. See Chapter 1:
Elements of Sound and Music.
Homophony: a musical texture comprised of two elements, a dominating melody and supporting
accompaniment; adjective homophonic. See Chapter 1: Elements of Sound and Music.
Imitation: the repetition, in close succession, of melodic and/or rhythmic material in one
part by another part. See Chapter 1: Elements of Sound and Music.
Impressionism: an artistic movement of the late 19th and early 20th century pioneered by
French painters whose muted colors, blurred outlines, and sensuous subjects influenced
contemporary poets and musicians, most notably Claude Debussy.
Improvisation: extemporaneous creation of music. Many Western European composers were
renowned improvisers (see for example biographies of Bach, Beethoven, and Chopin) and
the ability to improvise is essential in such traditions as Indian classical music, African tribal
music, and some styles of jazz, where the performers are the composers and the performance
is the work. Improvisation often takes place within established conventions, involving
preexisting material that the performer is expected to flesh out in the course of performance.
Improvisations are sometimes recorded, or later written down based on memory. See Chapter
3: Composer, Performer, Audience and Chapter 7: Jazz.
Instruments/instrumental music: see Chapter 2: Musical Instruments and Ensembles.
Interval: the distance between two pitches. Often expressed as a number of scale steps or as
the ratio of relative frequencies. See Chapter 1: Elements of Sound and Music.
Jazz: see Chapter 7: Jazz.
Key: tonic plus scale type, for example, G major, A minor. See Chapter 1: Elements of
Sound and Music.
Mass: service in the Christian liturgy that culminates in Holy Communion, the re-creation
of the Last Supper of Jesus and his disciples. Texts of the Mass have been set to music by
composers from the Middle Ages through today.
Melisma: in vocal music, a single syllable of text sung on a lengthy succession of pitches.
Melody: succession of musical tones that is perceived as constituting a meaningful whole.
See Chapter 1: Elements of Sound and Music.

GLOSSARY
Meter: organization of time in which beats are arranged into recurring groupings of two’s, three’s,
or some combination of two’s and three’s. See Chapter 1: Elements of Sound and Music.
Mode: scale type, determined by the size and succession of intervals. Most music from the
Western European tradition draws its pitch material from the major and minor modes.
Modulation: change of key. See Chapter 1: Elements of Sound and Music.
Motive: a short figure of distinctive melodic or rhythmic configuration that recurs throughout
a composition or section and functions as a unifying element.
Monophony: single-line melody; adjective monophonic. See Chapter 1: Elements of
Sound and Music.
Music theory: rules and principles of musical composition. Examples include rules of
counterpoint associated with the Western European tradition, the principles governing the
performance of raga and tala in Indian music, and practices of harmony and scales in jazz.
Musical theater: a play set to music for singers and instruments and performed on the stage
with costumes and scenery. Dance is an important component of many musical theater works.
Musical theater differs from opera in that dialogue is spoken rather than sung in recitative.
Opera: a large-scale dramatic production requiring solo singers, an orchestra, costumes,
scenery, and often choruses and dancers. The word “opera,” is the plural of “opus,” the Latin
for “work,” suggesting the multidimensional nature of the form. China, Japan, Indonesia,
and India are among the world cultures that have rich traditions combining music with other
theatrical elements and performance arts for ceremonies and entertainment.
Oratorio: similar to opera except that the subject is religious and the stage performance is
without acting, costumes, and scenery.
Orchestra: in its broadest sense, a large ensemble such as a symphony orchestra, marching band,
and jazz band or orchestra. In addition to a size of about 12 to over 100 players, other features of
orchestral ensembles are the division of the instruments into sections, direction of the ensemble by a
conductor, and performance in comparatively large venues, such a concert halls or even outdoors.
Counterparts to Western orchestral ensembles include the West Indian steel pan orchestra and the
gamelan of Indonesia. See Chapter 2: Musical Instruments and Ensembles.
Orchestration: the part of the creative process that involves designating particular musical
material to particular instruments.
Ostinato: from the Italian for obstinate or persistent, a clearly defined phrase or motive that
is repeated persistently, usually at the same musical pitch and in the same musical part,
throughout a section or passage.
Overture: a self-contained instrumental piece intended as an introduction to another work
such as an opera, oratorio, or musical theater
Percussion instrument: see Chapter 2: Musical Instruments and Ensembles.
Performance artist: an artist that works in two or more disciplines at once, one of those
disciplines being a performing art. An example would be a sculptor creating set pieces to
include in a theatrical performance of their own creation.
Performance practice: the conventions and customs associated with the performance of a
particular musical repertory—for example, the instruments employed, techniques of singing,
and the nature and extent of improvisation that are expected. See Chapter 3: Composer,
Performer, Audience.
Phrase: a fairly complete musical idea terminated by a cadence, which is comparable to a
clause or sentence in prose. See Chapter 1: Elements of Sound and Music.
Pitch: the location of a musical sound in terms of high and low. See Chapter 1: Elements of
Sound and Music.

GLOSSARY
Polyphony: from the Greek “poly” for many and “phono” for sound or voice, a musical
texture comprised of two or more simultaneous melodies of fairly equal importance; adjective
polyphonic. See Chapter 1: Elements of Sound and Music.
Polyrhythm: musical texture comprised of two or more simultaneous and independent rhythmic
lines; adjective polyrhythmic. See Chapter 1: Elements of Sound and Music.
Prepared piano: the insertion of foreign objects (screws, bolts, erasers, plastic, etc.) between
the strings of a piano to alter its timbre. See Appendix 1: John Cage.
Program music: instrumental music that portrays a story, scene, or other nonmusical subject.
Composers generally identify the subject in the title of the work. Compare absolute music.
Raga: an ascending and descending pattern of melodic pitches used in music of the Indian
subcontinent. See Chapter 8: World Music.
Ragtime: a genre of instrumental music from around the turn of the 20th century that is an
important predecessor of jazz. Most rags are for piano and are based on a steady one-two,
or oom-pah, beat in the left hand supporting a highly syncopated melody in the right hand.
Scott Joplin was one of the most prolific composers of piano rags.
Recitative: a style of text setting, found especially in operas and oratorios, that closely follows
the rhythm and accents of speech. Recitative is used primarily for narrative and dialogue
and is characterized by melody of narrow range that follows the accents of the text, spare
accompaniment, one pitch per syllable of text, little or no repetition of text.
Rhythm: the durational and temporal dimension of musical sounds. See Chapter 1: Elements
of Sound and Music.
Rhythm section: in jazz, the instruments that keep the beat and provide harmonic support.
Common members of the rhythm section are drum set, piano, string bass, and guitar.
Ritornello: from the Italian for return, the opening section of a work, particularly of concertos
and arias of the Baroque period, that recurs either as a whole or in part between sections of
contrasting material
Rondo: a musical form involving a principal theme that is stated at least three times in the
same key and intervening subordinate themes in contrasting keys. The rondo was a favorite
design of final movements during the classical period.
Rubato: a practice in performance involving changes in tempo for expressive purposes.
Sampler: a device that allows the user to digitally store, manipulate, and play back recorded
sounds.
Scale: arrangement of the pitch material of a piece of music in order from low to high (and
sometimes from high to low as well). Each element of a scale is called a “step” and the distance
between steps is called an interval. See Chapter 1: Elements of Sound and Music.
Score: the composite of all parts of a notated composition arranged one underneath the
others, each on a different staff. Conductors work from scores while performers read only
their particular part.
Serialism: a compositional method in which the composer constructs a germinal cell, usually
a series of pitches, which is then repeated over and over in various permutations throughout
the course of a work.
Solo: from the Italian for alone, the term is used for the part in ensemble music that is
performed by a single player (the soloist), such as the solo part in a concerto, and also as
descriptive of music intended to be performed by one player. In the Western tradition, the
largest solo literature is for keyboard instruments or for members of the guitar family, all of
which can create a complete musical texture without the participation of other instruments.
There is also a small solo repertory for unaccompanied violin, flute, and other instruments
that usually perform as part of an ensemble.

GLOSSARY
Sonata: from the Italian “sonare” the verb “to sound,” a common designation for instrumental
works to be performed by one player, for example, piano sonata, or a small group of
instrumentalists, for example, sonata for violin and piano.
Sonata form: a structural plan that evolved during the Classical period and has been used to
the present day as the design of symphonic, chamber, and solo movements. A movement in
sonata form consists of three sections: (1) exposition that presents two principal themes and
key areas; (2) development in which thematic material from the exposition is manipulated,
varied, and elaborated; (3) recapitulation that restates the themes of the exposition, but both
in the home key. This basic plan can be expanded to include an introduction and a coda.
See Chapter 1: Elements of Sound and Music
Staff: the Western European system of horizontal lines and intervening spaces that has been
used for the notation of pitch since the Middle Ages.
String instrument: see Chapter 1: Musical Instruments and Ensembles.
Strophic: a musical form in vocal music in which all verses of text are sung to the same music.
Subject: a theme or melody that constitutes the basic material of a composition, especially a fugue.
Symphony: a title applied mainly to orchestral music from the Classical period to the present.
Syncopation: irregular or unexpected stresses in the rhythmic flow. See Chapter 1: Elements
of Sound and Music.
