Virtual learning
Virtual learning is defined as learning that can functionally
and effectively occur in the absence of traditional classroom
environments (Simonson & Schlosser, 2006). In a publication
which examined the quality and extent of online education in
the United States, Allen and Seaman (2003) defined a blended
learning course as “having between 30% and 80% of the course

3 | 1. Introduction to Virtual Learning Design & Delivery

content delivered online” while they considered an online
course as having “at least 80% of the course content delivered
online” (p. 6). In both definitions, it necessitates instructors
having a clear understanding of the role of an effective online
instructor, one which differs greatly from that of their face-toface counterpart.
In their report, Transforming Higher Education (1995), Dolence
and Norris assert that one of the consequences of what they
view as the fundamental transformation from the Industrial
Age to the Information Age is that social institutions – among
them higher education – will also be transformed because of
a change in “both what people need to learn and how they
can and should learn.” Table 1 shows the different learning
characteristics associated with both the Industrial and the
Information Age as identified by Dolence & Norris.

The characteristics described in Table 1-1 show the need to
address the different instructor roles and requirements of
students in distance and online learning. This is not always an
easy task, and merely replicating the face-to- face methods
online does not allow the learning experience to be maximized
to full potential. Some fail to “make a transformational shift in
their approach to teaching from one of disseminating
information to one of creating learning environments where
students

co-construct

knowledge

through

interactions”

(Vaughan, 2010, p 61).
This transition from face-to-face to a blended or online
method of creating a suitable learning environment for students
challenges the instructor on a professional level and many are
concerned about the change in roles and responsibilities, use
of technology, relationships, presence, and a perceived lack of
prestige (Redmond 2011).
Pelz (2004) outlined three main principles of effective online
pedagogy. The first principle is centered on the fact that the
instructor must give way to student-led learning in an online
course due to the distance between the instructor and the
student. The instructor can adjust the curriculum to be more
student centered via letting students take charge of leading
their own learning. Pelz mentioned several ways this can be
done:

1. Student led discussions
2. Students find, discuss, and share web resources
3. Peer assistance and teaching
4. Peer grading and review
5. Case study analysis as a group where students can learn
from each other

5 | 1. Introduction to Virtual Learning Design & Delivery

The second Pelz (2004) principle of effective online pedagogy
is that interactivity is the key to quality online learning. Students
must have a way to connect with each other and to interact with
the instructor, other students, and the learning materials.
The final principle is the need for presence. In an online course,
the distance between the student, instructor, and learning
materials can lead to higher rates of dropouts and less
motivated

learners.

Through

integrating

approaches

to

increasing both student and instructor presence in the online
course, students will be more engaged in the learning process.
There are several different kinds of course presence that Pelz
(2004) outlines:
Social Presence: It is essential that the instructor create
an online learning community where each student can
express their online personality, can feel welcome to share
questions and ask for help, and can feel that they belong.
Cognitive Presence: Students need an environment
where they are free to construct meaning through discussion and a community of inquiry.
Teaching Presence: Students need an expert’s guidance,
and while online teaching requires students to become
more autonomous, they will still need to feel that the
instructor

is

present

to

answer

questions,

guide

discussions, push learning, and manage the virtual
classroom.
The communication strategies utilized in the blended or
online course are vitally important to the overall success of the
course, for student motivation and retention, to create instructor
and student presence, and to offer connections in the virtual
learning community.
In a study by Smith, Ferguson & Caris (2001), a number of
instructors were interviewed regarding their online vs face-to-

1. Introduction to Virtual Learning Design & Delivery | 6

face teaching experiences. The educational opportunities and
advantages of the web environment over traditional classes (p.
3) were mentioned as being of great benefit to students and
instructors. Instructors said that in an online course they could
assign readings from the Web, and electronic resources were
integrated into the class with ease. Another rich learning
experience is the ability to host guests from a distance,
providing students with the ability to interact with experts in
their field. Instructors also felt that threaded discussions lead
to a deeper level of thinking, as they felt students think more
deeply and profoundly when they have to write their thoughts,
particularly for their peers. While not a favorite with students,
an added advantage for instructors was that students in the
online experience were responsible for their own learning. Many
of these benefits come with potential challenges in a distance
or online course. These challenges can be identified by the
instructor in advance and can be discussed in the introductory
stage of the course. For example, the ability to use online
resources to deliver a course provides added value to the
learning experience, but students require specific skills to filter
useful and factual information from that which is less than
reliable. In addition, while threaded discussions may lead to
deeper level thinking, the reliance on written submissions may
not appeal to all students. Anonymity in a blended or online
course is often identified as an advantage which ensures
equality among students, and between the students and the
instructor, but it can also lead to misunderstandings which
should be addressed by the instructor in a timely manner.

“No Signigicant learning can occur without a significant
relationship.” Dr. James Comer, Yale University
Many

experienced

instructors

can

find

themselves

in

completely unknown territory when they first make the move
from face-to-face to blended or online teaching. According to
Bonk & Dennen (2003), without the necessary preparation and
training, many instructors attempt to replicate existing course
design and pedagogical practices when they make the
transition. Yet what worked in the face-to-face venue will not
work in online learning. Different approaches and techniques
need to be learned in order to build an online learning
community

and

to

have

effective

connections

and

communication with online students.
In online courses or course components, presence is of vital
importance to facilitate high quality learning. Anderson, Rourke,
Garrison, & Archer (2001) define presence as “the design,
facilitation and direction of cognitive and social processes for the
purpose of realizing personally meaningful and educationally
worthwhile learning outcomes.” They identify three key roles
in teaching presence, and provide indicators for each category.
These are presented in Table 1-2 below.

Instructor presence may be visible to students in the form
of direct communication, in facilitating discussion, providing
feedback and encouragement, addressing individuals who may
not be fully engaged in the process, or it may be unseen in
the form of the planning, management, and structural decisions
made in advance of, or during the course delivery. Planning
a blended or online course with these indicators in mind will
ensure that students are presented with a high quality
experience which will meet their needs.
Enhance Engagement and Motivation
The National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE) was
developed as a “lens to probe the quality of the student learning
experience at American colleges and universities” (2007, p. 3). In
defining student engagement as “the time and energy students
devote to educationally sound activities inside and outside of

1. Introduction to Virtual Learning Design & Delivery | 10

the classroom, and the policies and practices that institutions
use to induce students to take part in these activities,” decades
of research was considered and five properties were identified.
Effective educational practice provides properties for active and
collaborative

learning;

student

interactions

with

faculty

members; level of academic challenge; enriching educational
experiences; and supportive campus environment.
In a significant learning experience, Fink (2003, p. 6) suggests
there is a process and an outcome; students will be fully
engaged in their learning, with a high level of energy associated
with the learning experience, and the meaning from this
experience

will

be

result

oriented.

He

describes

the

characteristics of significant learning experiences below:
Table 1-3. Characteristics of Significant Learning Experiences
A well-designed and well-managed course, combined with an
instructor who communicates and interacts effectively with
students, and who delivers good quality learning experiences,
can lead to increased learner motivation and facilitate increased
student engagement in the course. In a study linking student
engagement and course redesign, Vaughan (2010) found that

frameworks about key course concepts, student success and
retention increased. In a follow-up with open-ended survey
questions, students identified the sense of community which
was developed through the redesigned assessment activities as
the most effective aspect of the course (p. 65). While further
study is needed in this area, it appears that redesigning all or
parts of a course to foster increased levels of active and

11 | 1. Introduction to Virtual Learning Design & Delivery

collaborative learning could potentially lead to increased
student success and retention.
In her paper on the transition from face-to-face to online
teaching, Redmond (2011) presents a chronology of different
researchers’ views on the role of the online instructor. She notes
that despite different labels used by

the researchers, “the

process of facilitating discussion appears to be a key role when
teaching in the online space” (p. 1053). In blended or online
courses, successful social interaction can lead to a breakdown
of barriers, open communication, collaboration among learners
and between learners and instructor, and as we have seen,
allows students to become actively engaged in the learning
process.
Redesigning a course to incorporate more active learning has
the potential not only to solve the student boredom problem,
but also to increase the quality of student learning (Fink 2003,
p. 24). Gilly Salmon has researched a five stage model on
increasing student motivation and engagement in online
learning:
1. Access and Motivation: Create easy to retrieve materials,
and a welcoming and encouraging environment
2. Online Socialization: Connecting through messages, and
providing content that is relevant to students lives
3. Information Exchange: Connecting learners to resources
and supporting learning
4. Knowledge Construction: Through lectures, readings,
assignments, and facilitated learning students build and
construct new knowledge
5. Development: Through responding and offering outside
resources students develop their learning outside the
course

There is one key concept that online instructors should always
keep in mind: Equivalency.
An online course should be managed as the equivalent to a
face-to-face course. If there was a group activity in the face-toface course, then there should be an online group activity. If the
instructor explained the final project in detail, then they should
in the online course as well. If there were lectures on critical or

1. Introduction to Virtual Learning Design & Delivery | 14

complex topics in the face- to-face course, then the same should
be offered in the online course. The online and face-to-face
courses should offer equivalent experiences.
In this section you will learn about some of the key skills an
online instructor can use to support the learning of virtual
students. We will look at some of the most common challenges
online teachers experience and cover various tactics and
approaches to managing online learning communities. Some of
the topics covered will be:
• Virtual Instruction: How to manage instruction, tutoring,
and lecturing in an online course
• At Risk: Connecting with at-risk students to offer support
• Learning Communities: The importance of building a
strong learning community
• Communication: Communicating with students
• Feedback: Providing detailed feedback on work in an
efficient and product way
• Efficiency: Use efficient tactics that offer great support on
limited time
• Be Choosy: Cognitive overload and cognitive underload of
student
Though the online teacher may never meet their students inperson, there are still many ways that an online instructor can
connect with students and offer tutoring and instruction on
the course topics. With advances in video, webinar, chat, and
other Web 2.0 tools online, instructors have a wide variety of
tactics at their disposal towards creating rewarding, engaging
and interactive online learning experiences that can be
equivalent to face-to-face learning.
The following are examples of various instructional strategies:

15 | 1. Introduction to Virtual Learning Design & Delivery

• Video Screencasting: There are many free screencasting
and video recording tools available to instructors. They can
use them to screencast their own computer screen and
show students how to do something online, talk

about
PowerPoint slides, give a lecture, or video
tutorials on a whiteboard. Using video and
screencasting technology offers the online
instructor a great opportunity for providing
lecture materials and concept support just
as they would in a face-to-face classroom. In
fact, to put a PowerPoint into an online
classroom without any lecture notes or a
screencasted lecture to go with it is akin to
standing in the back of a classroom and
flipping through the slides without saying
anything about them to the students. That
is not teaching in a face- to-face course, and it
is not teaching in the online course either.
Use the many tools online to offer screencasted
lectures of the PowerPoint slides to the
online students, and then this offers the
equivalent learning experience as they would
get in the face-to-face course. An example
tool:
◦ Screencast-o-matic ( http://screencast-o-matic.com/ )
• Webinar Tools: Instructors can use webinar tools to host
virtual synchronous tutoring sessions with students, or to
give a synchronous lecture to a class. These tools often have
interactive whiteboards and video function as well. An
example:
◦ Zoom ( http://www.zoom.us/ )

1. Introduction to Virtual Learning Design & Delivery | 16

• Instant Chat: There are many different types of instant chat
tools available on the web now. They offer a chance for
students to ask questions real-time, and to get immediate
feedback. Providing ’office’ hours in a chat tool, or in a
synchronous webinar tool (see above, such as Zoom), is not
only a great way to connect with your students, but a great
way to give them direct feedback and help on the course
content. Some examples:
◦ Facebook chat
◦ AIM chat
◦ Google Talk chat
◦ Skype chat
• Digital Learning Objects: There are now countless Web 2.0
tools on the web that can be used to create more
interactive learning objects in online courses. This type of
learning is much more engaging and interesting for
students. Just a few examples:
◦ Voice Thread – Asynchronous discussions with video (
https://voicethrcom/ )
◦ ThingLink – Make your images interactive (
https://thinglink.com/ )
◦ Popplet – Mind mapping and project planning (
https://poppcom/ )
◦ Quizlet – Create fun study tools for students (
https://quizlet.com/

)

These are just a few of the ways that an instructor can create
more interactive and engaging online learning experi- ences for
students.
Online learning can have less personal connections and
instructor guidance than face-to-face learning. For this rea- son,
some students feel more disengaged from the learning, and
online learning sees higher dropout rates than face- to-face

17 | 1. Introduction to Virtual Learning Design & Delivery

learning does. Online instructors should create a plan of
communication to connect with at risk students, and help them
get back on track. Following are some tactics:
• Keep Track: Keep track of failing students, or a list of
students that are behind on their work, and then call them
and email them to connect and ask if they need help on
the course topics.
• Office Hours: Offer ’office hours’ to help struggling
students. This can be as simple as being online in a chat
tool or webinar tool (see last section) to allow them a
chance to ask questions and get help.
•

Virtual Office Forum: Have a ’Virtual Office’
discussion forum in the online course, a
place where students can ask questions and
get guidance.

• Good Directions: Have detailed directions, grading rubrics,
and tutorials in the course that students can access for help
on completing course work.
• Be available: This does not mean you should have to
answer an email at midnight, but it does mean logging in
and checking for questions at least 4x a week.
Read the chapter in this eBook about Online Learning
Communities, as it covers this topic in greater depth. In short,
building a strong online learning community in which students
feel connected to the instructor, their peers, and the content
goes a long way to keeping students motivated and engaged in
completing the course. There are many tactics one can utilize to
build strong learning communities.
This topic will be covered many times throughout this eBook,
as it is such an important aspect to quality online instruction.
In a face-to-face course the instructor will be there in front of

1. Introduction to Virtual Learning Design & Delivery | 18

the students several times a week to remind them of upcoming
due dates, to answer questions, and to guide the students.
Remember our key concept, Equivalency. This should also be
done in the online course for students. This can be emulated
in the asynchronous course through weekly announcements
in the course, via email, and information posted in the Virtual
Office of the course. Through email and the forums instructors
can have regular communication with students to help keep
them on track, just like in a face-to-face course.
A part of good feedback is having a detailed grading rubric
for students. In a face-to-face course instructors can go over
requirements during lecture, but in an online course the
equivalent solution would be to have a grading rubric. Through
use of a grading rubric the students can see exactly what will
be expected of them on the assignment. Next, the instructor
should give detailed feedback on student work. For example,
in a paper the instructor should use editing tools to provide inline comments and suggestions. This, on top the grading rubric,
gives the student clear guidance on how to improve on their
skills. Offering chances to fix mistakes and resubmit work is also
a fantastic way to encourage a reflective learning cycle among
online students. Students also like to have instructors reply to
their discussion posts as they want feedback on their work.
Through interactive feedback an instructor can create a strong
learning experience for students.
Efficiency
Online teaching can quickly become overwhelming. Finding
ways to offer detailed and quality support, learning, and
feedback, but through efficient and time-saving methods, will
mean higher quality learning for less instructional time. For
example, save all the course announcements, as they can be

19 | 1. Introduction to Virtual Learning Design & Delivery

reused time and again. Create files of all tutorials and guidance
videos, which can be used over and over. We will continue to
discuss time-saving strategies throughout this eBook on each of
the main topics covered.
In this book we will stress over and over that being choosy is
the key to offering quality online learning design and delivery.
Choose the right tools, for the right job, for the right need, for
the right content. Choose the right teaching approaches, for the
right learning needs, for the right learning content. Be choosy.
If an instructor has too many tools in a course it can create
cognitive overload of the students, who become overwhelmed
and then they are learning to use tools rather than learning
the course content. On the other hand, having too few means
boring learning materials and few connection methods, and
that loses student interest and dedication as well. Try to choose
the right amount of tools for the needs of a given course and its
topics. For example, giving the students ten ways to contact the
instructor via ten different chat tools is too much. Just choose
one. By making smart and efficient choices then the tools work
for the course and students rather than the other way around.

Critical Thinking
1. Look up equivalency theory online. What is it? How
is equivalency defined in this chapter? How is it
important to the design of high quality online
learning experiences?
2. Consider your experience in the classroom and
identify the main challenges to ensuring students
are engaged in the learning process. How do you
ensure students have the opportunity to be fully
engaged in the online environment? How do you
deal with students who are not engaged?
3. Use the Internet to find different definitions of
online learning, distance learning, eLearning,
blended learning, virtual learning, and mobile
learning. What are the similarities and differences
between them? Are any critical factors are
missing? Why or why not? What would be your
definition of virtual learning?

Section 1: Connecting With Online
Students
There are many tools which can be used for connecting with
students in a blended or online course. Making use of programs
such as Skype, Google Hangouts, Blackboard Collaborate in the
Blackboard Learning Management System (LMS), or other
virtual meeting programs can replicate a face-to-face meeting.
Using asynchronous methods such as discussion forums, wikis,
blogs, email, or other social media tools such as Facebook,
Edmodo, YouTube, Twitter, Google+, and social bookmarking
encourage active and collaborative learning among students
and instruc- tors. For the online instructor, the time investment
can prove to be quite a challenge as the instructor presence
must be felt on a regular and consistent basis. Students need to
know that the instructor is available regularly and participates
actively in the course – that he or she is present.
Once logged on to the course or course social media tool,
an instructor can spend numerous hours dealing with various
course management issues such as contacting students,
providing feedback, addressing student concerns, drawing

27 | 2. Online Learning Communities

attention to misunderstandings, participating in discussions,
and monitoring and grading assessments and assignments. To
avoid unrealistic expectations, the students must be provided
with specific information regarding the instructor’s availability
and role in the online environment. As with any course
resources, there are practical considerations which need to be
addressed when delivering an online or blended course.
Students and instructors may experience some issues with
internet access, individual devices etc. These issues can often be
solved by the instructor or the institution with relative ease.
In addition to the academic requirements of the course, the
technical requirements should be very clear to students in
advance of the start date. This will ensure that, except in extreme
circumstances, all students will be able to fully participate in the
course and meet all course requirements and expectations.
Work Smart, Not Hard
Social interaction in online courses should always be handled
carefully and the instructor must be the role model and the
moderator of such interactions. Use of humor can be
problematic as students cannot see facial expressions or hear
nuances of voice, so may not realize that humor is intended.
For a similar reason, cultural sensitivity is vitally important and
an instructor will have to be aware of the potential for
disagreements to take place and how to deal with them swiftly.
Additionally, from an instructor’s point of view, those who are
used to seeing certain cues in a face-to-face context, such as
confused expressions to indicate lack of understanding, have
to rely on the students themselves to identify difficulties in
understanding in the online environment.
Learning to communicate online effectively, clearly, and
politely is often termed as ’netiquette.’ Learning proper

2. Online Learning Communities | 28

netiquette is one of the key online teaching and learning skills
that both students and instructors will want to acquire. Learning
to manage time effectively is also important, as online teaching
and studies can easily take over one’s life. In an effort to
communicate with everyone, an online instructor can begin to
feel overwhelmed by the number of posts in their inbox or the
discussion forums. Where possible, think of strategies to
efficiently communicate that won’t take up all your time.

Section 2: Building A Learning
Community
The key to building connections and a warm learning
environment online is simple: make it personal. Students want
to feel that the instructor notices them, cares about them, and

29 | 2. Online Learning Communities

is there to support them. Following are some key tactics in
creating strong online communities with students:
1. First Names: Every time you address a student, in the
discussions, by email, anywhere online, always use first
names.
2.

Personal Notes: At the start of the course
note a few facts about each student (Mark,
Colorado, likes parks, wants to manage a
wildlife refuge). Then, when relevant,
integrate a personal fact into a comment
you make (Nice work, John, on your
discussion review of this nature preserve,
which I expected since you would like to work
in managing such areas after you graduate.). This takes very
little effort or time on the instructor’s part, and makes the
student feel like an individual who is valued and respected
and will encourage them to feel more connected to and
motivated in the online classroom discussions.

3. Include Everyone: Make an effort to respond to students
whose posts still have no replies, so that they will feel
included and more motivated to participate as well.
4. Make Communication Channels Clear: The instructor
should set regular office hours, or give students multiple
means of contacting them (phone, a special discussion
forum, office hours, online chat-hours, email). At a
minimum, an announcement of the week’s due dates and
work should be sent out on the first day of the week. It is
recommended to send at least two updates a week to keep
students on track. A variety of regular communication
methods with the students helps them to feel like they are
part of a connected community.

2. Online Learning Communities | 30

5. Allow Small Talk: Sometimes some discussion threads will
break down into irrelevant chit-chat. Do not discourage this,
as this allows the students the time to build stronger social
connections that are important in keeping them motivated
to participate in the online course. The instructor can reply
and note the topic (Happy Birthday Sue!), and then gently
guide them back onto the course topic with an interesting
resource, fact, or question.
6. Explain Netiquette: Some people have the wonderful
knack for clear communication skills online while others do
not. At the start of the course give students an outline of
what netiquette is, and how to employ it. Here is a quick
review of netiquette:
1. Explain that disagreement is wonderful, but should be
done politely. Give the students examples of polite
disagreement (I respect and understand your views
Jane, but I have a different experience I would like to
share. . . ).
2. Outline what emoticons are and how to use them to
exhibit body language, meaning, and tone in the online
format.
3. Explain that ALL CAPITALS is equivalent to YELLING at
someone.
4. Tell students to refrain from sarcasm and even some
jokes, as it is too easily misunderstood online.
7. Manage the Personalities: Most blended and online
courses will have the same array of student personalities
that the face-to-face course will contain; the bully, the
dominate, the timid, the unmotivated, the struggling, the
high achiever, the demanding, and so on. How these
personalities interplay online will be different from course
to course. The timid may need to be encouraged less since

31 | 2. Online Learning Communities

it is online and they may feel less shy than in face-to-face
sessions. On the other hand, a bully is less likely to be rude
or inappropriate in the classroom where the instructor is
present but may be more trouble in the online discussions.
It is important to bring in the shy and struggling while
managing the difficult so that bullies do not ruin the
learning experience of other students.

• Example: Rude, inappropriate or offensive comments
should be addressed directly and quickly to stop the
behavior immediately. If a student posts something rude,
never ignore it. It will only get worse if you do not put a stop
to it. If necessary, delete the offending post. If the offended
student emails you complaining, don’t commiserate (Yeah,
that was rude of him!), and don’t say how you will deal with
the other student (I will email and tell him to get his act
together), as that could violate student privacy laws if you
do this. Just explain that you have heard their concern, and
will deal with the situation. Next, contact the rude student
right away. Explain that you had to delete the post (if it was
bad enough to delete).
◦

Important: Do not be too harsh or
judgmental on the first offense. Give the
student a way to save face so that they
will be motivated to stop the behavior
and so that the situation is less likely to
escalate or get worse. In some cases they
really did not realize how inappropriate or
rude something was and will stop if given
the chance to learn from their mistake.

2. Online Learning Communities | 32

There may be something else going on in
the student’s life to make them be rude
in the forums (sick one at home, death in
the family, financial or familial stress). In
most instructors’ experience a personal,
but polite and kind, email to them will
put a stop to the behavior. In rare cases it
may not, and then a more strict email
may be warranted. If that does not stop it,
then the situation may need to be
escalated to the Academic Dean.

Introduction
In one of the greatest Greek tragedies, Agamemnon, Aeschylus
begins his drama with word of beacon fires carrying news of the
fall of Troy and the return of the king—news that set in motion
Clytemnestra’s plan to kill her husband in long-delayed revenge
for his slaying of their daughter. These signal fires would have
required a series of line-of-sight beacons stretching 500 miles
around the Aegean Sea. Line-of-sight communication, as signal
fires would require, has a long history. Most broadcast television

39 | 3. Planning the Perfect Online Course

applications require line of sight; even communications
satellites orbiting in the Clarke Belt thousands of miles above
the equator are “in sight” of the uplinks and downlinks on Earth.
Communication with someone you can see has a visceral
element that is missing when that person or group of people
is not “in sight.” Certainly, considerable communication in
distance education does not involve face-to-face instruction. The
heart of distance education is the concept of separation of
teacher and learner. Many say the meeting of students with
teachers will soon be a relic of the past, like signal fires. This
group touts the convenience of “anytime, anyplace” learning
and the power of modern communications technologies to
unite learners with instructional events no matter when they are
needed and no matter where students may be located.
Others advocate the need for face-to-face instruction. This
group stresses the importance of seeing and being seen, and
the personal nature of the teaching/learning environment.
Some even say that you cannot really learn some topics without
being in a specific place with a select group of collaborators.
A third position is advocated by others who say that education
should occur using a combination of instructional strategies.
Schlosser and Burmeister (1999) wrote about the “best of both
worlds,” where courses and programs would have varying
percentages of face-to-face and distance-delivered learning
experiences. Blended or hybrid approaches are probably the
most widespread applications of distance education (Orellana,
Hudgins & Simonson, 2009; Daffron & Webster, 2006; Epstein,
2006).
To date, however, no clear and verified process for determining
whether face-to-face instruction, distance instruction, or a
combination of the two is best. Most instructional designers and
instructional technologists know that Richard Clark was correct
when he said that media are “mere vehicles,” but when courses

3. Planning the Perfect Online Course | 40

are designed and instruction delivered, what are the templates,
the processes, the approaches to be used to determine whether
a module, course, or program should be delivered face to face
or online? Or, what percentage of each is “best”? Where is the
research? Certainly, decisions about how a course is to be
delivered should not be based solely on the “beliefs” of the
instructor or the mandates of administrators. Signal fires told of
the fall of Troy probably because that was the most appropriate
technology available. Today, many technologies are available for

Section 2: Why Plan For Teaching At A
Distance?
Just like other kinds of teaching, distance education requires
planning and organizing. However, teaching at a distance,
whether synchronous or asynchronous, requires that greater
emphasis be placed on the initial planning phase.
On October 25, 1965, downtown St. Louis stopped in its tracks
and thousands watched as the last piece of the mammoth
Gateway Arch was being put into place. The weight of the two
sides required braces to prevent them from falling against each

41 | 3. Planning the Perfect Online Course

other. Fire hoses poured water down the sides to keep the
stainless steel cool, which kept the metal from expanding as the
sun rose higher. Some horizontal adjustments were required,
but when the last piece was put into place and the braces
released, it fit perfectly, according to plan, and no one was
surprised (Liggett, 1998). The thousands of onlookers applauded
as the sun reflected off the bright span. The architects and
engineers who were also watching smiled and went back to
their offices.
Just like the Arch, distance education requires a careful
process that includes systematic design before implementation. Success is almost guaranteed if all the pieces of the plan
receive the same attention as the most obvious. The base
sections of the Gateway Arch required more engineering savvy
and study than any other component. The last and most visible
span that connected the two halves received the most attention
from the thousands of onlookers, but success was directly
related to how the original supports were positioned.
Design is the fundamental element of effective instruction.
Many

think

that

the

traditional

systematic

models

of

instructional design are not relevant to the online teaching.
Some claim that the traditional models of design such as the
Dick, Carey, and Carey’s model (2011), and its derivative the
ADDIE model, cannot be readily applied to instruction that is
delivered to distance learners. Some claim that systematic
planning is not important or even needed when learnercentered instruction is developed.
In spite of claims, the evidence remains clear that the key to
effective instruction is the concept of design, defined by Seels
and Richey (1994) as:
“the process of specifying conditions for learning. The
purpose of design is to create strategies and production

3. Planning the Perfect Online Course | 42

at the macro level, such as programs and curricula, and
at the micro level, such as lessons and modules.” (p. 30)
At the root of most widely practiced and classic design
approaches is the concept of systems. The idea of systems used
in instruction is derived from Bertalanffy’s General Systems
Theory (1968), and Banathy’s Instructional Systems (1991; 1968),
usually called instructional systems design. This process has
served as the intellectual technique of those in the field of
instructional technology and distance education for decades.
Instructional designers, the engineers of quality instruction
similar to the construction engineers and architects who
designed the Gateway Arch, are on the front-lines of distance
education implementation. Certainly, modern interpretations of
the ADDIE model, such as the Unit-Model-Topic approach have
been proposed to clarify and simplify the approaches for the
systematic design of distance delivered instruction. However,
any approach that makes claims about quality but that does
not have the systems approach at its foundation should be
considered suspect.

Section 3: Introduction Principles Of
Instructional Design Systems
Systematic Process
Instructional Design for online and blended courses will be
covered in more detail in the next two chapters. Here we present
an introduction to the topic.
The process of systematic planning for instruction is the
outcome of many years of research (Dick, Carey, & Carey, 2011).
An analysis of the application of this process indicates that when
instruction is designed within a system, learning occurs. The
process of instructional design is a field of study. Instructional
design

is

considered

the

intellectual

technique

of

the

professional who is responsible for appropriate application of
technology to the teaching and learning process. In other words,
instructional design is to the instructional technologist as the
rule of law is to the lawyer, the prescription of medicine is to the
medical doctor, and the scientific method is to the chemist—a
way of thinking and solving problems (Thompson, Hargrave, &
Simonson, 1996).
A critical part of the process is to consider the components of a
successful learning system (Dick et al., 2011). These components
are the learners, the content, the method and materials, and the
environment, including the technology. The interaction of these
components creates the type of learning experience necessary
for student learning.
The components must interact both efficiently and effectively
to produce quality learning experiences. There should be a
balance among the components—none can take on a higher
position than the others. The attempt to keep the components
equally balanced while maintaining their interaction effect is

3. Planning the Perfect Online Course | 44

essential to planning quality instruction. Simply stated, a series
of activities alone cannot lead to learning; it is only with the
careful planning for their balance and interface that learning is
the result.
Another critical part of the process is evaluation. For successful
learning to take place, it is vital to determine what works and
what needs to be improved. Evaluation leads to revision of
instruction, and revision of instruction helps secure the final
outcome of helping students learn (Smaldino, Lowther, &
Russell, 2012). Because of an emphasis on planning and revising,
well-designed instruction is repeatable. This means that the
instruction can be applied again in another class. For example,
instruction designed for a televised, multisite class can be used
again with a new group of students at different sites. Because it
is “reusable,” the considerable initial effort is well worth the time
and energy.
Planning for Instruction at a Distance
The process of planning and organizing for a distance education
course is multifaceted and must occur well in advance of the
scheduled instruction. One “tried and true” approach for
planning instruction is to model others. One excellent resource
is Pina and Mizell’s book Real-Life Distance Education: Case
Studies in Practice (2014). This book provides research-based
case studies about distance education. This book helps to
eliminate trial-and-error preparation. Additionally, distance
learning faculty should:
• Keep in mind that courses previously taught in traditional
classrooms may need to be retooled. The focus of the
instruction shifts to visual presentations, engaged learners,
and careful timing of presentations of information.

45 | 3. Planning the Perfect Online Course

• In revising traditional classroom materials, consider ways to
illustrate key concepts or topics, using tables, figures, and
other visual representations.
• Plan activities that encourage interaction.
• Plan activities that allow for student group work. This helps
construct a supportive social environment. For example,
the instructor could present case studies related to theories
and concepts covered in the course, and then groups of
students could discuss case study questions and reach
consensus on a solution to the problem.
• Be prepared in the event that technical problems occur. If
synchronous equipment fails, it is important for students to
have projects and assignments independent of the
instructor and alternative means of communi- cation (e.g.,
fax, phone, e-mail). Discussing alternative plans with
students ahead of time in case there is a technological
problem will eliminate confusion and loss of productive
class time when a problem occurs (Orellana, Hudgins
Simonson, 2009).
In addition to considerations related to planning for instruction,
there is also a need to examine issues associated with the
separation of instructor and some or all of the students. Time
constraints for class delivery, lack of eye contact, visualization
of the materials, and planning for interaction require a
reconsideration of classroom dynamics. Often instructors use
visual cues, such as student facial expressions, within the
traditional classroom and conversations with students after
class to decide quickly to adjust the instructional approach for
a course. These cues give instructors insights that help them
personalize the instruction for the students and ensure a quality
learning experience for all.
In an online course it is more difficult to acquire visual cues

3. Planning the Perfect Online Course | 46

from

and

about

students.

Even

when

using

desktop

conferencing technologies, the visual component provides
limited information to the instructor. Teaching at a distance
eliminates many of these cues. Alternative approaches to
ongoing evaluation of instruction must be incorporated. If
instructors ignore this area of preparation, planning to teach as
they always have, they may feel frustrated. Likewise, students
may become alienated and may begin to” tune out” the
instructor. The instructional development process must be
based on the unique characteristics and needs of students,
meshed with the teaching style of the instructor and the course
goals and content. Interaction must be maximized, the visual
potential of the medium must be explored, and time constraints
must be addressed.

Section 4: Issues To Address In The
Planning Process
Who are the Learners?
There are several reasons for bringing students together in a
distance learning setting. Students can be pooled into classes of
sufficient size to create a critical mass. Students can aggregate
for advanced courses in subjects that might not otherwise be

47 | 3. Planning the Perfect Online Course

available on-site. Distance education can be an important
approach to responding to the growing pluralism of learners’
backgrounds, characteristics, or unusual learning needs that
may require or benefit from specialized instruction. One reason
profiles are so important in social media is because people want
to know their “friends”, or at least know about them. Distance
learning students want to “know” their instructor and to be
known by their classmates.
Taking the time to learn about the learners in the class yields
a more productive learning environment. Knowledge of general
learner characteristics can inform the instructor of the nature of
the students at local and distance sites. This knowledge can aid
the distance education instructor in overcoming the separation
of instructor and students.
Along with the general information about the learners, an
instructor needs to know the number of students in the class.
In video-based distance education classes, knowing how many
students are at each site and the number of sites involved in
a synchronous distance education class can influence the level
of interactivity. For example, in an on-line class with a large
number of participants, it is likely that some students will fail to
interact in discussions. Thus, an instructor needs to know his/her
students and what technologies are available to them to plan
effectively for interactive learning. Also, it is essential to know the
nature of the audience. Are students from urban areas? Rural
areas? What is their age range, grade range, and educational
background? All this can have a marked impact on the levels
of interaction among students. The instructor may have to plan
more carefully for the types and levels of interaction to ensure
a quality learning experience for all members of the class. The
cultural, social, and economic backgrounds of the students also
constitute important information for the instructor. In addition,
educational expectations of learners can also influence the

3. Planning the Perfect Online Course | 48

quality of the learning experience. The attitudes and interests
students

bring

to

the

class

will

impact

the

learning

environment. Thus, an instructor who wants to create a quality
learning experience for all members of the class, with the
ultimate goal of learning as the outcome, will be certain to
account for these variables in planning.
Analyze the General Abilities of the Class
Analysis of the cognitive abilities of the class allows the
instructor to observe how students relate to the content of the
lesson. Such issues as clearly defining the prerequisite
knowledge or skills for the specific learning experience are
important to ensure a successful learning experience. The
students’ prior experience with similar types of cognitive tasks is
important.
Further, learning styles have once again become an important
area of consideration. With the introduction of Gardner’s
multiple

intelligences

has

come

the

resurgence

of

an

examination of learning styles (Gardner, 1993). How students
approach learning is as important as how well they can function
in the classroom. So knowing more about how students interact
with information is important in creating a valuable learning
environment.
An instructor can determine students’ general knowledge and
ability in a number of ways. Pretests and portfolio reviews can
provide information about learners’ abilities. Because students
are coming to the class from a variety of backgrounds and
learning experiences, they may be underprepared for the
content intended for a particular course, and thus will be
frustrated and even unsuccessful in the learning experience. Or,
conversely, they may already be familiar with the content and
will be bored and uninterested in participating in the class.
By knowing more about students, the instructor can develop

49 | 3. Planning the Perfect Online Course

supporting materials to individualize instruction. Varying the
presentation of materials to match different learning styles (e.g.,
animation, text, verbal descriptions, visual messages) can also
ensure the greatest potential for reaching all learners.
The instructor can present complex cognitive content in ways
that

give

learners

clues,

scaffolds,

for

understanding

fundamental concepts, and thereby reach a wider range of
individuals. People can remember complex material better if
chunks of information are grouped into spatially related
locations. Placing similar ideas in a logical sequence can aid
retrieval of information at a later date.
Analyze Potential for Learner Interactivity
Students who are less social may find the distance education
environment more comfortable for them. Students may
become more expressive because of the perception of privacy
and the informative nature of mediated communication. They
may perceive the increased and varied interactivity and
immediate feedback as a positive input to their interface with
the learning experience.
Additionally, students can benefit from a wider range of
cognitive, linguistic, cultural, and affective styles that they would
not encounter in a self-contained classroom. The emphasis
should not be on the inherent efficiency of the distance
learning, but on the values and services offered to students
through their exposure to others (Herring & Smaldino, 1997).
Relationships can be fostered, values can be expanded, and
shared purposes or goals can be developed. Distance learning
experiences can serve as “windows to the world” by providing
extended learning experiences.
When special efforts are made, distance education actually
can enhance learning experiences, expand horizons, and
facilitate group collaboration (Dede, 1990). Students can have

3. Planning the Perfect Online Course | 50

more direct experiences with the information (e.g., close-up
viewing of an experiment is possible). Time for reflection is
possible before responding to the prompts presented, and the
ability to work with peers or experts enhances the potential
for learning. One of the most effective techniques to promote
interaction

in

distance

education

is

the

threaded

discussion—instructors post questions related to reading,
viewing, and/or listening to assignments, then students post
comments in a discussion area. Wade, Bentley, and Waters
(2006) have identified 20 guidelines for successful threaded
discussions. One critical guideline is the division of large classes
into subgroups of 10 to 15 students so that discussions are
manageable. A rule of thumb for the instructor’s involvement
in threaded discussions recommends that early in a course, the
instructor should post once for every 4 or 5 student postings,
then as students take more responsibility for their own learning
later in the course, the instructor might post once for each 10 to
12 student postings—primarily to keep the discussions on track
(Simonson, 2007).
Understand Learner Characteristics To be effective, it is
necessary to understand the learners in the target audience.
Willis (1994) suggested that the following questions should be
asked prior to development of distance learning environments:
• What are students’ ages, cultural backgrounds, interests,
and educational levels?
• What is the level of familiarity of the students with the
instructional methods and technological delivery systems
under consideration?
• How will the students apply the knowledge gained in the
course, and how is this course sequenced with other
courses?
• Can the class be categorized into several broad subgroups,

51 | 3. Planning the Perfect Online Course

each with different characteristics?
These questions are not easy ones to answer. An instructor
should attempt to find the answers prior to the first class
meeting. Asking a few well-chosen questions of individual
students will help the instructor understand their needs,
backgrounds, and expectations. Additionally, students will feel
they are important to the instructor. In an online environment,
it is often more difficult for the instructor to get information
about students; thus it is essential that the instructor plan a way
of inviting students to share information about themselves. Be
careful to respect their right to privacy, while trying to learn as
much as you can about them.
Help Learners Understand the Context of the Learning
Experience
Morrison, Ross, and Kemp (2013) refer to three types of context:
orienting context, instructional context, and transfer context.
They suggest that the learners need to grasp the intent of the
instructor when participating in various types of learning
experiences. When the learners have an understanding of the
reasons why they are participating in a particular type of
instructional activity, they are better able to use that experience
to expedite their own learning.
Each of these contexts serves a particular purpose for the
learner. The orienting context refers to the students’ reasons
for being in a course. These reasons vary among the students.
For example, a student may be participating in a course for
credits toward a pay raise. Or, a student may wish to change
positions within a company, which is dependent on completing
the particular study area.
Instructional context addresses the learning environment.
Scheduling a course to meet at a certain time and location or
specifying dates for completion of assignments also impact the

3. Planning the Perfect Online Course | 52

manner in which the student interacts with the class. Knowing
how convenient it is for students to access the resources or to
rearrange their own personal and work schedules is important
when planning instruction. The third context, transfer context,
refers to the way in which the knowledge will be used by
students. It is critical when planning that the instructor
considers what information is important so the students will
apply it to work or school applications. Students will value that
information they perceive as useful. Knowing the students and
their interests or needs will help the instructor plan useful
learning experiences to ensure transfer of learning.
What Is Essential Content?
The content of a course needs to reflect where this content
relates to the rest of the curriculum. It is essential to examine the
nature of the content, as well as the sequence of information. In
any synchronous distance learning environment, one particular
issue, that of time constraints, impacts other planning areas.
Time constraints refer to the actual online time for delivery,
which is often limited and inflexible. The issue of limited time
makes it necessary to closely examine the essential elements
of the course content. The instructor needs to balance content
with the limited time for learning activities and possibly remove
extraneous, nonessential information.
Generally speaking, the scope of the content for a course
needs to be sufficient to ensure the entire learning experience
will lead to the desired outcomes. Concepts, knowledge, and
specific skills need to be identified (Dick et al., 2011). Supporting
information or knowledge is important to the scope of content
analysis. Follow-up and applications of the content should be
considered.
The instructor’s time is best spent on content analysis if the

53 | 3. Planning the Perfect Online Course

content is organized within a hierarchy. Starting with the
general goals, followed by more specific goals and objectives,
the nature of the structure of the content can be made to fall
into place. The resulting framework of information about
content helps the instructor decide the value and importance
of specific information to the total instructional package. It is
important to remember that no matter which media formats
are used in distance education, the trend is to reduce the
“amount” of information delivered and to increase the
“interactive value” of the learning experience. Thus, the
instructor may need to remove content that had been included
in a traditional presentation of a course. Or, the instructor may
need to consider delivering information through alternative
means, such as additional readings or booklets designed
specifically for tasks.
The instructor also needs to examine the sequencing of
information. A number of variables—for example, characteristics of the learners, their prior knowledge, content, time, and
number of sites involved—are critical when deciding the order of
presentation of information. Because the instructor and some or
all of the members of the class are separated, the material must
be sequenced in a logical fashion for the students.
Goals and Objectives for Instruction
The challenge of education is to match the content of the
subject to the needs of the learners. Broadly stated goals are
a helpful starting place for the instructor. The instructor must
decide what is appropriate for a group of students and for the
individuals within that group. Each instructor constantly must
face the challenge of adapting instruction to the student who is
expected to learn it. Although content is important, instructors

3. Planning the Perfect Online Course | 54

should remember that their focus is on the students. This is
critical when establishing goals for any course.
The traditional approach for writing objectives is also effective
for distance education courses. Specifically, objec- tives should
state the conditions under which learning should occur, the
performance expected of the learner, and the standard to which
the performance will be matched.
One way to write objectives is as follows:
TABLE 3.1:
Given:

The conditions under which learning occurs

The
learner
will:

meet some predetermined level of performance

According
a minimum standard
to:

The objectives of a particular lesson may not necessarily change
simply because an instructor teaches at a distance. Good
instructional goals should form the basis for instruction,
regardless of the medium used. Instructional goals and
objectives always should be shared with the students, helping
both the origination and remote-site students to focus on the
parameters of the instruction. This information may be included
in

course

outlines,

presentation

handouts,

or

presented at the beginning of the course.

By Dr. Michael Simonson, Nova Southeastern University
Students can provide insight into the design of the learning
experience. They can give feedback in lesson design and
instruction delivery. Using a simple feedback form, students can
describe or indicate in some other way their expectations and
perceptions of the class structure and the delivery mode. The
instructor can examine information students provide to
determine if the mode of presentation was effective. Evaluating
these responses, the instructor can gain an understanding of
how the learners perceived the class experience. An instructor’s
personal philosophy will influence the approach to teaching at a
distance. An individual’s philosophical belief will affect selection
of goals and curricular emphases, and influence how that

3. Planning the Perfect Online Course | 56

individual views himself or herself as a classroom instructor. The
instructor who thinks in the philosophical arena of realism,
idealism, essentialism, or perennialism will see the instructor as
the central figure in the classroom, delivering knowledge and
modeling to the student, an instructor- centered approach. On
the other hand, the instructor who advocates the philosophies
of pragmatism, existentialism, progressivism, constructivism, or
social reconstructionism thinks that the student is the central
figure in the class- room. The instructor is viewed as the
facilitator of learning by guiding, rather than directing the
students, thus modeling a student-centered approach.
Although the dynamics of a philosophy will not predict an
instructor’s success in the distance education classroom,
successful teaching at a distance places the recipients’ needs
before organizational convenience and at the center of planning
and decision making. The individual needs of the learners are
brought to the forefront in education that uses electronic
technology because separation of learners from the instructor
requires students to take more responsibility for learning.
Consequently, the learner’s opinions and needs play a more
important role in decision making than is usual in an instructorcentered environment (Macfarlane & Smaldino, 1997). It is
oversimplified to suggest that there is one best way to teach at
a distance. In any given content area, there are several potential
ways of providing a quality learning experience for the students
(Smaldino, Lowther, & Russell, 2013). However, the one thing that
has been repeatedly demonstrated through research is that
lecture, or the “talking head” approach, is the least successful
strategy to employ in distance education. What is essential in
deciding which strategy or strategies to employ is the issue of
engaging the learner.
The instructor should focus on selecting instructional
strategies that engage all the learners in active learning. To do

57 | 3. Planning the Perfect Online Course

this, the instructor may need to de-emphasize the “informative”
part of the instruction for more “discovery” of information. The
emphasis on keeping the learners engaged in learning ensures
that students will be in tune with the class.
Media Selection
Several models are often used in selecting media (Dick et al.,
2011; Holden & Westfall, 2006). The common theme among these
models is the learning context, which is the content, the
intended outcome, and the nature of the students. Practical
considerations such as available resources for creating media
and the technologies for delivery of instruction also play a hand
in the selection process. Mainly though, the goals and objectives
will influence the selection of media. McAlpine and Weston
(1994) have come up with a set of criteria for selecting media,
whether they are commercial media or media developed
specifically for a particular course. The first criterion is to match
the medium to the curriculum or content. Other criteria include
the accuracy of information, motivational quality, engagement
quality, technical quality, and unbiased nature of material. These
should be considered in selecting media in order to match
student needs to the strategies employed.
Media that are “off the shelf” are often considered sufficient
for a quality learning experience in the traditional classroom
(Heinich et al., 2002). However, in a distance learning
environment, the “ready-made” materials may need to be
adapted or modified to accommodate the technologies
involved in instructional delivery. Some materials may need to
be enlarged or enhanced to be seen by students at a distance.
With others, the digital format may need to be changed.
Because of the nature of distance learning and the separation
of the instructor from the students, it is essential that the

3. Planning the Perfect Online Course | 58

instructor begin to think visually. Too often, instructors do not
place enough emphasis on designing and using quality visual
materials. Taking the time to develop good visual media will
enhance the quality of the learning experience (Heinich et al.,
2002).
Visualizing Information
Visuals provide a concrete reference point for students,
especially when they are engaged in an asynchronous learning
experience. Even if the visuals are lists of concepts and ideas,
they can help students. Visuals also help learners by simplifying
information. Diagrams and charts often can make it easier to
understand complex ideas. A visual that breaks down a complex
idea into its components can show relationships that might be
otherwise confusing to students. Also, visuals that serve as
mnemonics can assist student understanding. Visuals help
students in their study as well. They can use the visuals to
prepare for tests and other means of assessing their learning.
What Is the Learning Environment?
Educators are familiar with classroom settings; they are
comfortable with using the space available to enable learning
to take place. It is when the classroom shifts into a distance
learning setting that the environment often becomes a
challenge to the instructor. Several important elements must be
addressed within the distance learning environment.
Technology
The type of setting, be it place- or time-shifted, will influence
planning decisions. Environments that are place- shifted are

59 | 3. Planning the Perfect Online Course

those that are synchronous but are not in the same location
(e.g., a live, video-based distance class). Those that are timeshifted are asynchronous, where students access the class at
different times. Assessing the use of technology in a distant
setting is essential. In any distance learning environment, the
technology becomes an element of concern for the instructor.
The instructor must become familiar with the hardware and
the nuances of the technology to use them effectively. The
instructor needs to balance concern for the operation of the
equipment with effective teaching. Once the technology
becomes transparent in the educational setting, the instructor
can reflect on the lesson quality, the outcomes, and the plans for
subsequent lessons.
Several issues are associated with technology when teaching
in a distance learning mode. First is the basic operation of the
equipment. In a televised distance learning setting, switching
between sites is usually a simple procedure, but it does require
instructor time to acquire the finesse to operate the switching
buttons smoothly—to manipulate cameras, to control sound
levels and to change graphic images. Second, using additional
cameras in the classroom can create some concern for the
instructor. The overhead camera needs to be focused and
materials lined up to ensure that learners in all sites can see
the material. Third, the instructor should always consider what
the student should be viewing during the lesson. Is it better
to see the instructor, the visuals, or other students? When an
instructor has had experience teaching with the equipment,
these decisions become automatic, making learning the
foundation for the decisions made (Herring & Smaldino, 1997).
In an online learning environment, the instructor needs to be
concerned with the layout of the courseware and the types of
resources available to the students learning at a distance. The
instructor needs to be certain the material is designed in a way

3. Planning the Perfect Online Course | 60

that is intuitive for the various types of learners who may be
interacting with it. The instructor also needs to be concerned
about student access to the appropriate hardware and software
to be successful in connecting to the courseware, and that the
students can complete the tasks expected of them. Finally, the
instructor needs to be certain that the students understand
the terminology being used. Today, at a minimum, the typical
distance student needs only a computer with a modern monitor
to view course materials.
It is essential that the instructor be prepared with alternatives
in case of technical problems. What will the students do during
a synchronous class being delivered using desk top video such
as ZOOM (a proprietary videoconferencing software system) if
the technology is not operating properly—or at all? Preplanned
contingencies should continue the learning process even
though the technology is malfunctioning. Alternative lessons
must always be ready but, it is hoped, never needed. Students
need to be prepared to know what to do with those materials.
The materials must be designed to be used without instructor
intervention. Recording of synchronous sessions is almost
always a good idea.
Resources
The

second

element

to

consider

in

the

instructional

environment is the resources available to students. What
materials will they have at hand? What materials will be
available in libraries and laboratories? Will students have access
to resources for easy communication with the instructor?
These are the types of concerns that an instructor needs to
address when thinking about the learning environment. It is
difficult to plan for a particular type of learning activity if the
room cannot be adapted or changed in any way. For example, if

61 | 3. Planning the Perfect Online Course

the instructor plans a group activity in which students will need
to communicate to one another, how will this be accomplished?
Planning to Teach at a Distance
Much of what has been suggested in the planning process is not
specific to a particular type of distance technology or delivery
mode. Rather, the instructional design process is relatively open
to any instructional setting. But, when planning to teach on the
Web,

an

instructor

needs

to

address

some

essential

considerations. One very important issue is that the instructor is
“ready” for the course to begin. It is frustrating for students who
begin an online course only to find that all the materials are not
prepared or not accessible at the time they need them. It would
be advantageous for the instructor planning an online course for
the first time to consider working 3 to 5 months in advance of
the beginning date. This will ensure that the materials will be
planned and prepared in a timely fashion. Another important
issue when teaching online is that of establishing the
communications framework. All too often, instructors of online
courses “complain” that students expect them to be available all
the time. If you as instructor do not intend to check your course
materials daily, indicate that with the initial materials that are
distributed. Tell students they can expect a response within a
day or that you intend to be online checking the course on
specific days of the week. That way both students and faculty
will not be frustrated by the interrupted communications
process.
Instructors have found that to ensure quality and promptness
with online coursework, it is necessary for the students to know
exactly when assignments are due. A calendar or timeline is very
important. Providing students with rubrics or guides for how
to complete assignments well is also very important. The more

3. Planning the Perfect Online Course | 62

information students have about completing assignments, the
fewer problems the students and instructor will experience
during the course.
Finally, when planning to teach online, advise students (and
this is a good piece of advice for the instructor as well) to set
aside specific periods of time during the week to work on the
course. It is so easy to let it slide that often the complaint is
that there is never enough time to get all the work done. This
usually results from someone letting the work pile up before
getting to it. With an online course, it is best to plan several
shorter periods per week, rather than one longer one. This helps
to check things out, do work offline for a period of time, and
then to finish up before the time period is up. Part of the initial
materials presented to the students should provide guidelines
for students to ensure a successful learning experience. When
it is noted that a student is falling behind in the work or is
not participating at an acceptable level, the instructor should
contact that student privately, either by e-mail or by phone, to
see if there is a reason for non-participation. This takes time,
but the instructor will find it beneficial for a successful distance
learning experience.

Section 5: Models For Designing Online
Courses
Traditionally, there are four approaches for the instructional
design of courses that are to be delivered asynchronously using
the World Wide Web. The four approaches are not entirely new.
Two are based directly on the individualized instruction
movement of the 1950s and 1960s. The four models are:
1. Linear-designed instruction
2. Branched-designed instruction
3. Hypercontent-designed instruction
4. Learner-directed design
Although these four design models are different in approach
and use, they have several similarities. First, instruction is divided
into units. Different instructional designers use terms such as
units or blocks instead of modules, but all refer to a subdivision
of a course’s content. Generally, a three-credit college course
would have about three units divided into 12 modules, each
taking about a week to complete. Designers further divide
modules into topics that directly relate to the module.
Linear-designed instruction is based on linear programmed
instruction. First, major subdivisions of a course are identified—usually three for a three-credit college course. Next, a
content area such, as distance education foundations, is divided
into important ideas. These ideas are called modules. Modules of
instruction are divided into topics. Each topic has instructional
events, or learning experiences, followed by some kind of an
assessment. Before students are permitted to continue to the
next topic within a module they must successfully complete the
assessment. If the assessment is an objective test, they must

3. Planning the Perfect Online Course | 64

pass the test. The sequence of topic-related instructional events
followed by assessments continues until all topics in a module
have been studied. Often, a module-ending assessment must
be completed before the student moves to the next module.
Similarly, there are often mid-course assessments and end-ofcourse assessments that require the student to synthesize
learning that is related to many modules.
Linear-designed instruction is sequential. Students move in
the same path through the concepts, topics, and modules, and
complete the same assessments and tests.
Branched-designed instruction is similar to linear with two
major exceptions. First, assessments are more sophis- ticated in
order to diagnose a student’s progress and understanding of
concepts and topics. If a student shows a propensity for topics
in a module, it is possible to skip ahead, or branch forward.
Similarly, if a student has difficulty, the assessment process will
require that the student branch backward, or to remedial
instruction, before moving forward in the lesson.
The

second

distinguishing

characteristic

of

branched-

designed instruction is the use of alternative instructional
events or learning experiences. In other words, students may
interact with different instructional content depending on the
results of assessments. Just as a human tutor might decide that
an algebra student needs more practice with mathematics, a
branched-designed lesson might require a student to complete
a drill-and-practice lesson on long division. Branched-designed
instruction is difficult and time consuming to effectively
produce, and is not often used in distance education.
Hypercontent-designed instruction also has units, modules,
and topics. First, modules are identified and organized into units
of similar content. Next, topics related to the module are
identified and learning experiences are designed and produced.
These topics are presented using text, audio, graphics, pictures,

65 | 3. Planning the Perfect Online Course

and video. Finally, a module assessment activity is developed.
This assessment is designed to determine if a student has
successfully

completed

and

understands

the

module

satisfactorily. If so, the student moves to the next module in the
sequence of modules.
Within the module, there is little instructor-determined
sequencing of topics. Rather, the topics and corresponding
learning experiences are studied in an order determined by the
learner. In other words, the student has control and topics can
be studied in a random, nonsequential manner, or in a
hypercontent order. Often a course-ending assessment such as
a major paper, presentation, or product is required. This design
approach is the most common model used.
The final design module is the learner-directed design. For this
approach, the instructional designer identifies units, modules,
and topics, including learning experiences, but places no
sequence or order on the topics within modules, or among the
modules themselves. Learners decide what order of topics are
studied, and sometimes even the topics themselves. Learners
construct their own instructional strategies and even their own
instructional design. Students move through modules in any
order they choose. Few, if any, requirements are placed on the
student by the instructional designer.
To be successful, this approach requires considerable talent
and effort on the part of the learner. Direction is given to
students by module goals and by outcome assessment
activities. Some constructivists who advocate learner-directed
design procedures ask students to construct their own outcome
assessments.
Instructional design models for online instruction are evolving.
These four approaches draw on the experience and research of
the programmed instruction efforts of the past. Some teachers
mix and match the four approaches into amalgams of design

3. Planning the Perfect Online Course | 66

procedures. The four approaches just described are something
of a starting point for course design. Next, literature dealing
with what is commonly referred to as “best practices” will be
reviewed.

Section 6: Best Practices In Course
Design For Distance Education
One key to effective distance education is correct instructional
design, a systematic process that applies research- based
principles to educational practice. If the design is effective,
instruction will also be effective.
Distance education has been practiced for more than 150
years, passing through three phases: first, correspondence
study,

with

its

use

of

print-based

instructional

and

communication media; second, the rise of the distance teaching
universities and the use of analog mass media; and third, the
widespread integration of distance education elements into
most forms of education, and characterized by the use of digital
instructional and communication technologies. Peters (2002)
has suggested that “the swift, unforeseen, unexpected and
unbelievable achievements of information and communication
technologies” will require “the design of new formats of learning

67 | 3. Planning the Perfect Online Course

and teaching and [will cause] powerful and far-reaching
structural changes of the learning-teaching process” (p. 20).
Peters’ views are well accepted, but there is also consensus that
the most fruitful way of identifying elements of quality
instruction may be to re-examine “first principles” of distance
education and mediated instruction.
Perhaps the first of the first principles is the recognition that
distance education is a system, and that the creation of
successful courses—and the program of which they are a
part—requires a “systems” approach. Hirumi (2000) identified a
number of systems approaches but noted a concept common to
all: that “a system is a set of interrelated components that work
together to achieve a common purpose” (p. 90). He described
a

system

that

involved

the

efforts

of

faculty,

staff,

administrators, and students, and consisted of eight key
components:

curriculum,

instruction,

management

and

logistics, academic services, strategic alignment, professional
development,

research

and

development,

and

program

evaluation.
Bates (in Foley, 2003) proposed twelve golden rules for the use
of technology in education. These rules offer guidance in the
broader areas of designing and developing distance education:

1. Good teaching matters. Quality design of learning activities
is important for all delivery methods.
2. Each medium has its own aesthetic. Therefore professional
design is important.
3. Education technologies are flexible. They have their own
unique characteristics, but successful teaching can be
achieved with any technology.
4. There is no “super-technology.” Each has its strengths and
weaknesses; therefore they need to be combined (an

3. Planning the Perfect Online Course | 68

integrated mix).
5. Make multiple media available to teachers and learners.
Print, audio, video, and computers should all be available.
6. Balance variety with economy. Using many technologies
makes design more complex and expensive; there- fore,
limit the range of technologies in a given circumstance.
7. Interaction is essential.
8. Student numbers are critical. The choice of a medium will
depend greatly on the number of learners reached over the
life of a course.
9. New technologies are not necessarily better than old ones.
10. Teachers need training to use technology effectively.
11. Teamwork is essential. No one person has all the skills to
develop and deliver a distance learning course; therefore,
subject-matter experts, instructional designers, and media
specialists are essential on every team.
A number of these guidelines are overlapping. Three of them (1,
2, and 11) address course and program design. Any examination
of first principles should first examine instructional design.
While it has been noted that instructors, even those new to
distance education, can learn to adapt courses and create
materials for online delivery (Ko & Rossen, 2010), and the authoreditor model has long been an element of correspondence
study

programs,

“what

is

strikingly

missing

in

these

arrangements, usually, is an instructional designer and many
good features of the instructional design approach” (Moore &
Kearsley, 2012, p. 101). The team-based approach to distance
education course development is generally regarded as more
likely to result in high-quality materials, experiences, and, hence,
more satisfactory teaching and learning experiences (Hirumi,
2000).
Bates’s triumvirate of subject-matter expert, instructional

69 | 3. Planning the Perfect Online Course

designer, and media specialist is the standard core of the course
design team, which may be expanded—one source (Hanna,
Glowacki-Dudka, & Conceicao-Runlee, 2000) has suggested as
many as eight members—based upon the particular needs of
the program and the media employed. No single approach to
course design is ideal; as Moore and Kearsley (2012) noted, the
course team approach results in “materials [that] are usually
much more complete and effective. Furthermore, [it] tends to
emphasize the use of multiple media in a course” but is “very
labor-intensive and therefore expensive, and it involves a lengthy
development period” (p. 101-2). Of the two approaches, “the
author-editor approach is the only one that makes economic
sense if courses have very small enrollments or short lifetimes,
while the course team approach is justified for courses with
large enrollments and long-term use” (p. 102).
Foley (2003) has noted “there are general principles of good
design that can be applied to all distance learning activities” (p.
831), but noted the following influences:
• The target audience of the activity
• The content of subject matter to be delivered
• The outcomes or objectives desired (p. 831)
Other considerations having “profound effects on the design of
the learning activities” (p. 831) include:
• The cost effectiveness of the system
• The opportunity costs of alternative systems and methods
• The availability of technology to the provider and to the
learners
• The geographical location of the learners
• The comfort level of the learners with any technology that is
used (p. 834)

3. Planning the Perfect Online Course | 70

Foley notes that these factors apply equally well when
designing instruction for any given audience, from children to
adults. When designing the World Bank’s Global Development
Learning Network, “results of more than 30 years of research on
adult learning were applied to the distance learning programs”
(p. 832). The criteria included:
1. They are based on clearly established learning needs and
built around succinct statements of outcome.
2. They are based on a variety of teaching and learning
strategies and methods that are activity based.
3. Effective distance learning materials are experiential. . . they
address the learner’s life experience.
4. Quality distance learning programs are participatory in that
they emphasize the involvement of the learner in all facets
of program development and delivery.
5. Successful distance learning programs are interactive and
allow frequent opportunities for participants to engage in a
dialogue with subject-matter experts and other learners.
6. Learner support systems are an integral part of any
successful distance learning program. (p. 832)
The Indiana Partnership for Statewide Education (IPSE, 2000)
proposed “Guiding Principles for Faculty in Distance Learning”:
• Distance learning courses will be carefully planned to meet
the needs of students within unique learning contexts and
environments.
• Distance learning programs are most effective when they
include careful planning and consistency among courses.
• It is important for faculty who are engaged in the delivery
of distance learning courses to take advantage of

71 | 3. Planning the Perfect Online Course

appropriate professional developmental experiences.
• Distance learning courses will be periodically reviewed and
evaluated to ensure quality, consistency with the
curriculum, currency, and advancement of the student
learning outcomes.
• Faculty will work to ensure that incentives and rewards for
distance learning course development and delivery are
clearly defined and understood.
• An assessment plan is adapted or developed in order to
achieve effectiveness, continuity, and sustainability of the
assessment process. Course outcome assessment activities
are integrated components of the assessment plan.
• Learning activities are organized around demonstrable
learning outcomes embedded in course components,
including course delivery mode, pedagogy, content,
organization, and evaluation.
• Content developed for distance learning courses will
comply with copyright law.
• Faculty members involved in content development will be
aware of their institution’s policies with regard to content
ownership.
• The medium/media chosen to deliver courses and/or
programs will be pedagogically effectual, accessible to
students, receptive to different learning styles, and sensitive
to the time and place limitations of the students.
• The institution provides appropriate support services to
distance students that are equivalent to services pro- vided
for its on-campus students.
• The institution provides its students at a distance with
accessible library and other learning resources appro- priate
to the courses or programs delivered via technology. It
develops systems to support them in accessing and using
these library and other learning resources effectively.

3. Planning the Perfect Online Course | 72

• It is important to provide the appropriate developmental
experiences for faculty who are engaged in the delivery of
distance learning experiences.
• The institution implements policies and processes by which
the instructional effectiveness of each distance learning
course is evaluated periodically.
• Timely and reliable technical support is vital to the success
of any distance learning program.
• It is recommended that a system of faculty incentives and
rewards be developed cooperatively by the faculty and the
administration, which encourages effort and recognizes
achievement associated with the development and delivery
of distance learning courses.
• The institution will communicate copyright and intellectual
property policies to all faculty and staff working on distance
learning course development and delivery.
• The institution complies with state policies and maintains
regional accreditation standards in regard to distance
learning programs. (www.ihets.org/learntech/
principles_guidelines.pdf)
Commonalities between these principles and those suggested
by other authors and organizations may be readily perceived.
For instance, careful planning and the need for teacher training
are cited by Bates (in Foley, 2003), and the emphasis on the
unique needs of students in a variety of contexts is mentioned
by Foley (2003). The IPSE principles make an important
contribution by highlighting the need for consideration of
copyright law and policies, intellectual property ownership,
faculty

incentives,

and

policies

and

accreditation

standards.
Because education (including distance education) is a system,
each of its elements interacts with other elements, making

73 | 3. Planning the Perfect Online Course

difficult the isolation of elements. Interaction (its type, quantity,
quality, timing, etc.), for instance, cannot be separated from
instructional philosophy, choice of media, and other factors.
Whatever media are selected to facilitate instructor-student
and student-student interaction, it should be recognized that
these forms of mediated discussion should not completely
replace the face-to-face element in courses. As Peters (1998)
noted, those who think that new, digital media will “supply the
interactivity and communication lacking in distance education.
. . cherish a hope here that will prove to be serious self-delusion”
(p. 155). Peters’s comments on the topic (in the context of
videoconferencing, a relatively rich, “high-bandwidth” form of
communication), trenchant and incisive, are worth quoting at
length:
Communication mediated through technical media remains
mediated communication and cannot replace an actual
discussion, an actual argument, the discourse of a group
gathered at a particular location. Mediated communication and
actual communication stand in relationship to one another like
a penciled sketch and an oil painting of the same subject. What
takes place in a discussion between two or more people can only
be transmitted in part electronically. . . .A virtual university that
does without face-to-face events by referring to the possibility of
videoconferencing can only ever remain a surrogate university. .
. .There is no doubt that to a certain extent [videoconferencing]
will improve the structure of communication in distance
education—but it cannot ever take the place of personal
communication in distance education. (p. 155)
Peters’s views on virtual communication have not been
significantly modified with time.
They reduce, surround, parcel out, spoil or destroy experiences
gained at school or university. For this reason, it may be

3. Planning the Perfect Online Course | 74

concluded, learning in virtual space will never be able to replace
completely teaching in real spaces. (p. 104)
The effective use of a variety of media to facilitate
communication, combined with critical quantities of wellstructured

face-to-face

instruction

and

learning,

have

characterized many distance-delivered programs. They are two
key elements of the model of distance education what has been
called “the best of both worlds”—a combination of face-to-face
and online instruction (Schlosser & Burmeister, 1999).
As important as is the appropriate selection and use of
technologies of instruction and communication, technologies
are not critical elements in shaping students’ satisfaction with
their distance courses. Rather, satisfaction is deter- mined by
“the attention they receive from the teachers and from the
system they work in to meet their needs. Those needs, “what all
distant learners want, and deserve” include:
• Content that they think is relevant to their needs
• Clear directions for what they should do at every stage of
the course
• As much control of the pace of learning as possible
• A means of drawing attention to individual concerns
• A way of testing their progress and getting feedback from
their instructors
• Materials that are useful, active, and interesting
At the same time, it should be noted that frustration with the
use of complex, inadequate, or malfunctioning equipment, as
well as perceptions of emotional distance engendered by the
use of distance education technologies, have negatively affected
students’ attitudes toward—and, in some cases, achievement
in—distance education.
Bates’s seventh golden rule, that “interaction is essential,” is

75 | 3. Planning the Perfect Online Course

well accepted by the field, and is a central element in most
definitions of distance education (see, for instance, Keegan, 1996,
and Schlosser & Simonson, 2012). Keegan (1996) noted that
distance education must offer “the provision of two-way
communication so that the student may benefit from or even
initiate dialogue” (p. 44). Initial provisions for interaction were
primarily for student-instructor interactions, but with the
availability of expanded communication technologies in the
1990s came an increasing emphasis on additional forms of
interaction. Three forms of interaction are widely recognized by
the field: student-content, student-instructor, and studentstudent. It is this third form of communication, reflecting, in part,
andragogical and constructivist perspectives, that has increased
dramatically with the rise of online education.
Concurrent with the expansion of online education and the
diffusion of new communication technologies, there arose the
mistaken belief that if interaction is important, “the more
interaction there is in a distance education class, the better”
(Simonson, 2000, p. 278). As Simonson (2000) has noted, early
research in the field had “demonstrated clearly that the
provision for interaction was critical” (p. 278), but later research
indicated as clearly that “interaction is not a magic potion that
miraculously improves distance learning” (p. 278). Indeed, “the
forcing of interaction can be as strong a detriment to effective
learning [as is] its absence” (p. 278).

perceptions of interaction (as compared with observations of
their interaction), Sorensen and Baylen (2000) noted that in a
videoconference class with several sites students accurately
noted that across-site interaction was very low, within-site
interaction was very high, interaction changes with instructor

3. Planning the Perfect Online Course | 76

location, remote site students participate less, and group
activities increase interactions. However, students perceived
that less interaction occurred over time (when, in fact,
interaction increased), and that technology inhibits interaction
when, more accurately, it seems to create different patterns of
interaction (p. 56).
Although Sorensen and Baylen (2000) examined interaction
in the context of an interactive television course, their findings
have implications for other distance education modalities. The
researchers concluded that a sense of community formed
among students at the distant sites, but interaction increased
when the instructor was present

at a given distant site.

Sorensen and Baylen noted that “varying activities and
including hands-on exercises and small and large group
discussions were instructional methods appreciated by the
students” (p. 56). Students in the Sorensen and Baylen study
expressed satisfaction with the “distance learning experience,”
but suggested that the course include “at least one opportunity
for students to meet face-to-face” (p. 57).
Distance teaching institutions (and their students) have a
wide variety of instructional and communication media from
which to choose. These two categories (instructional and
communication) may be, to some extent, addressed separately,
but they are often one and the same. Bates’s fourth golden
rule, that there is no “super-technology,” is well accepted and
understood by experienced instructional technologists and
distance educators, but often less so by those new to the field
(and many, many of today’s practitioners fall into this latter
category). For this reason, it is important to invoke the findings
of Clark (1983) explained in an earlier chapter, who noted, two
decades ago, that “media do not influence learning under any
conditions” (p. 446).
If, as Clark (citing hundreds of studies and decades of

77 | 3. Planning the Perfect Online Course

research) maintains, the application of any particular medium
will neither improve student achievement nor increase the
speed of learning, what criteria might a distance teaching
institution apply in the selection of media for the delivery of
instruction and the facilitation of communication? Cost (to both
the institution as well as to the student) is an obvious criterion.
Less obvious, perhaps, are the culture of the institution and
expectations of students (or potential students).
At a very practical level, Ko and Rossen (2010) suggested that,
prior to selecting media and instruction for online education,
the institution’s resources should be assessed and the following
questions should be asked:

• What’s already in place (what, if any, courses are being
offered online; who is teaching them, etc.)?
• What kind of hardware and operating system does your
institution support?
• What kind of network has your institution set up?
• What kind of technical support does your institution
provide? (p. 19)

As Ko and Rossen noted, “the tools an institution uses and the
support it offers very much influence the choices [the instructor
will] need to make” (p. 18).
Other guidelines for selection of media for synchronous
communication, in the context of one best practice in distance
education—collaborative,

problem-based

student

groups—have been offered by Foreman (2003). Foreman noted
the usefulness of a wide variety of synchronous technologies:
chat, telephone conference, Web con- ferencing and application
sharing,

voice-over-IP,

and

spectrum—chat

because

and

and

because

videoconferencing is expensive, is frequently of low technical
quality, and often fails to capture many of the visual cues so
helpful for communication. Modern desk-top systems, such as
ZOOM, have significantly reduced these problems.
Telephone conferencing, however, “is highly effective for
organizing small-team distance learning experiences” (Foreman
2003, para. 6), as it “provides immediacy, a high rate of
information exchange, and complex multi- person interaction
facilitated by a familiar audio cueing system.” Foreman
recognized that telephone conferencing can be expensive but
counters that significant savings may be realized through
inexpensive three-way calling op- tions—which, “despite its
name, four or more people can use. . . at once” (para.
7)—available through most telecom providers and cell phone
companies.
In the end, all of the criteria just mentioned are considered
and, frequently, a pragmatic approach is adopted. As Bates
recommends in his fourth golden rule, “each [medium] has its
strengths and weaknesses, therefore they need to be combined
(an integrated mix)” (Foley, 2003, p. 843).
The literature abounds with guidelines for distance education
and identified best practices of distance education. Sometimes
these

the

overwhelming majority of cases, the products of practitioners
relating practices that have proven successful for that author.
Still, some common threads have emerged.
Graham, Cagiltay, Lim, Craner, and Duffy (2001) offered seven
lessons for online instruction:

79 | 3. Planning the Perfect Online Course

1. Instructors should provide clear guidelines for interaction
with students.
2. Well-designed discussion assignments facilitate
meaningful cooperation among students.
3. Students should present course projects.
4. Instructors need to provide two types of feedback:
information feedback and acknowledgment feedback.
5. Online courses need deadlines.
6. Challenging tasks, sample cases, and praise for quality work
communicate high expectations.
7. Allowing students to choose project topics incorporates
diverse views into online courses. (http://ts.mivu.o rg/
default.asp?show+article&id=839 )
In his eighth“golden rule, Bates notes that “student numbers are
critical.” While this observation is made in the context of cost
and media selection, student numbers are, indeed, critical in
at least two other respects: class and working- (or discussion) group size. Distance education has been embraced, in some
quarters, as an opportunity to reduce costs by increasing class
sizes. The literature clearly indicates that there are practical
limits beyond which the quality of instruction and learning are
compromised. As Hanna, Glowacki-Dudka, and ConceicaoRunlee (2000) noted, “demand for interaction defines the size
of face-to-face classrooms and the nature of the interactions
within those classrooms; the demand for interaction has a
similar effect upon online classrooms” (p. 26). Palloff and Pratt
(2003) suggest that experienced online educators can “handle”
20 to 25 students in an online course, while “instructors who are
new to the medium, or instructors teaching a course for the first
time, should really teach no more than fifteen students” (p. 118).
Orellana (2009) has reported that the optimum class size for an

3. Planning the Perfect Online Course | 80

online class with one instructor is about 20, if optimum levels of
interaction are desired.

Section 7: Recommendations For
Distance Delivered Instruction
These recommendations are based on the current literature of
the field of distance education (Simonson, 2005; 2008). These
recommended guidelines are intended to provide ways to
organize courses and be guiding principles that will make
courses with equal numbers of semester credits equivalent in
terms of comprehensiveness of content coverage, even if these
courses are offered in different programs, cover different topics,
and are delivered using different media.
Assessment Guidelines
Assessment is defined as the determination and measurement
of learning. Ultimately, assessment is used for grading.
Assessment is directly related to learning outcomes.
• 1 major assignment per unit
• 1 minor assignment per two to three modules

81 | 3. Planning the Perfect Online Course

A typical three-credit course has the following assessment
strategy:
• 1 examination
• 1, ten-page paper
• 1 project
• 3 quizzes
• 3 small assignments (short paper, article review, activity
report)
• graded threaded discussions, emails, and chats
Learning Outcome
A learning outcome is observable and measurable. Learning
outcomes are a consequence of teaching and learn- ing—of
instruction and study. Often, learning outcomes are written with
three

components:

conditions

under

which

learning

is

facilitated (instruction), observable and measurable actions or
products, and a minimum standard of expectations. Often, there
is one learning outcome for each course topic. For example, a
learning outcome for a topic dealing with the median might be:
After studying the text, pages 51-53, reviewing the PowerPoint
with audio presentation on measures of central tendency, and
participating in synchronous chats, the Child and Youth Studies
student will satisfactorily complete the objective test dealing
with measures of central tendency at the 90% level.
Content Guidelines
Traditionally, instructors have offered content by making
presentations during face-to-face instruction. Additionally,
readings in textbooks and handouts are required of students.
Flipped classes, a currently popular approach, expects students

3. Planning the Perfect Online Course | 82

to access all course materials, including pre-recorded lectures
or presentations, as homework. Classes are then devoted to
discussions and interactions in the classroom or during live,
synchronous sessions.
In distance teaching situations, readings in texts, handouts,
and information placed in the course management system are
often used to deliver content. For high-quality courses, there
should be an emphasis on the use of various forms of visual
media to offer instructional content. Videos, visual presentations
with accompanying audio, and other graphical representations
of important topics are important to the well-designed course.
A variety of delivery systems for content should be considered,
including the use of compact discs, electronic files posted to
Web sites, and streaming (Blackinton, 2013). Content is
organized into topics for students. Topics are combined into
modules of similar topics, and modules are used to form units
(Figure 5-6).
Modules might have three to five topics presented in the
following ways:
• Readings in the text or other written materials
• Videos
• Audio recordings of speeches or presentations
• Recorded presentations using PowerPoint with
prerecorded audio
• Synchronous chats with content experts
Instruction/Teaching Guidelines
The pace of instruction for learners is a critical concern to the
distance educator. Because many distance education students
are employed full-time, it is important to offer instruction in
a way that complements their other responsibilities. These

83 | 3. Planning the Perfect Online Course

guidelines relate to the pace of instruction and the need for
continuing interaction between instructors and students in a
typical college semester:
• 1 module per week
• Instructor e-mail to students each week
• 1 synchronous chat per week
• 2 to 3 threaded discussion questions per module
• Instructor comments on discussions as part of threaded
discussion board
• Progress reports (grades) submitted to students every week
or two
These course design guidelines are based on the literature of
distance education and are derived from an analysis and review
of quality courses delivered at a distance.
The simplicity of the Course Unit (also referred to as the
Carnegie Unit) has made it the standard for course design,
primarily because it is easy to apply. The Course Unit requires
750 minutes of class time for each semester credit, which
translates into 15, 50-minute class sessions. A three-credit
college course would meet three times a week for 15 weeks,
according to most interpretations of the Course Unit. It is easy to
count class sessions in order to determine if a course measures
up. If traditional students are in class for 3 hours per week, they
probably spend about 6 hours per week outside of class doing
homework, reading, completing assignments, and viewing
course materials. Thus, a typical student might be expected to
be involved in a typical college three-credit course for
somewhere between 100 and 150 hours, or 5 to 10 hours each
week in a 15-week semester. This rule of thumb is also explained
in Chapter 7. The Unit-Module-Topic approach to course design
can be used to meet this “time standard.”

3. Planning the Perfect Online Course | 84

It is essential that the instructor take the time to plan and
organize the learning experience when engaged in teaching
at a distance. The instructional design process provides the
framework for planning. Instruction must be at a standard that
is acceptable in all venues. The students should be engaged,
and the instructor should be satisfied. Planning makes the
difference in a successful learning environment.

CRITICAL THINKING
1. Of the four models listed, which is best for a
project-based course? A science course? A math
course? Outline what topic you are going to teach
and decide which model best suits the learning
needs.
2. What is equivalency theory, and how does it relate
to the design of quality online learning
experiences? Why does equivalency matter?

CHAPTER TASK
Create a list of learning activities completed in your faceto-face course. Then create a second column of
equivalent learning experiences that could be applied
in the online course. Remember that equivalent does
not mean equal. Some learning activities done in a class
might not be done in the online course, but an
equivalent learning experience should be designed for
the online course to take the place of the one completed
in the face-to-face course. Students should receive the

3. Planning the Perfect Online Course | 86

same level of quality learning opportunities regardless of
delivery format of the course.
Some examples to get you started:
1. A face-to-face course has a group field trip to a
park. An online course asks the students to visit a
local park and take photos of ecosystem indicators
and then post them to a discussion forum and talk
about what they learned and observed.
2. A face-to-face course has a guest speaker. The
online course could still have an interview with the
guest speaker as a video, or have the guest speaker
present in a webinar format to the students.
3. A face-to-face course has a live debate or role play.
The online course could have a debate or role play
in the form of a discussion thread.

Section 1: Introduction
When starting an online course design project, it is critical that
course developers have a clear understanding of what
constitutes quality online learning and an approximate amount
of time required to design and develop an online course. Some
institutions use a rubric to help guide quality instructional
design such as the Quality Matters (QM) rubric. The QM rubric
consists of eight general standards that range from course

4. Instructional Design Principles | 94

overview and introduction criteria to accessibility and usability
criteria.
This eBook will use two instructional design models to guide
the learning:
• Successive Approximation Model (SAM), by Michael Allen
(1993)
• Backward Design (BD) Model, by Grant Wiggins Jay
McTighe (1998)
Both of these models highlight the importance of starting with
the end first. They design backwards from the learning
objectives to ensure that all content is directly aligned to the
course learning goals. These models start with analyzing and
clarifying what competencies and course outcomes are desired,
and then mapping back so that all learning content and
assessments directly support those end goals. This means that
the course developer should begin the design process with
measurable and clearly written course-level outcomes that will
be mapped or aligned to all assessments, instructional
materials, activities, and/or technologies utilized in the course.
By knowing where we want learners to end we can thus design
the best pathways for getting there.
Definitions
In this chapter, the following definitions will be used:
• Blended-learning – A delivery model where a portion
(40%-60%) of the course contact hours are face-to- face (f2f)
and the remaining are conducted via online eLearning
activities and Learning Management System (LMS)
software. Synonymous with: Hybrid Learning, sometimes

95 | 4. Instructional Design Principles

called a form of distributed learning.
• Instructional Design (ID) – An organized procedure for
developing instructional materials, classes, or pro- grams.
Synonymous with: Instructional Design Systems.
• Educational Technology – The study and ethical practice of
facilitating learning and improving performance by
creating, using, and managing appropriate technological
processes and resources (according to the Associ- ation of
Educational Communications and Technology [AECT]).
• Electronic Learning (eLearning) – Use of electronic media
and devices through networks or interactive
telecommunications systems to connect learners,
resources, and instructors at varying levels of technology integration and delivery formats including distributed
learning, blended-learning, synchronous or asynchronous
online courses, digital collaboration, Web 2.0 integration,
and Knowledge Management. Synonymous with: Internetbased training, online learning, distance education, CBT,
WBT.
• Online Learning – A class where 40% or less of the course
hours are f2f, with the greater portion of the course hours
being delivered via online asynchronous or synchronous
eLearning activities and LMS software.
• Technology Integrated Face-to-Face (TIF) Learning – A
term for face-to-face (f2f) instruction utilizes technology
and/or web-based electronic media to support teaching
and learning processes. Synonymous with: Distributed
learning.
• Learning Management System (LMS) – LMS is a term used
for any learning management system an educational
program uses, and can include, but is not limited to:
Moodle, Blackboard, Sakai, and Canvas.

Face-to-face (f2f) instruction that integrates

created to host the eLearning resources so as to
supplement this teaching. Traditional f2f courses
can implement a variety of LMS tools, including
quizzes, assignments, communication tools
(such as discussion forums), and group project
work.

Blended
Learning:

A hybrid/mix of face-to-face instruction and
distance instruction where a portion of the
course hours are conducted online either
asynchronously (different time and different
places) or synchronously (same time but
different places). From 20% up to 60% of the
course hours can be online, while at least 40% of
the course hours must remain face-to-face.
Hybrid courses can also implement a variety of
LMS tools, including quizzes, assignments,
communication tools (such as discussion
forums), and group project work.

Online Learning

Online learning is where >60% of the course
instruction is online using eLearning
technologies and an LMS. There is minimal
face-to-face interaction between the student
and teacher, and all learning material is hosted
in the LMS. The teacher and students
communicate via the discussion forums, chat
rooms, instant messaging, by phone and with
email. The entire course is orga- nized in such a
way that students are able to learn at their own
pace yet respecting the deadlines for course
deliverables.

Section 2: Instructional Design Models
Instructional design approaches should attend to the following
important factors:
• Equivalency – Designing for equivalent learning
experiences is one of the most important concepts of high
quality instructional design. A student should have an
equivalent learning experience in an online course as to
what they would do and learn in a face-to-face course
(Simonson, Smaldino Zvacek, 2015).
• Quality – The blended learning or online course should
allow for high-quality learning experiences that attend to
the 4 M’s; measurable, motivational, meaningful, and
memorable (Allen Sites, 2012).
• Success – The blended learning or online course should be
designed in such a way that students can guide their own
learning to successfully achieve the learning goals and
competencies.
• Reputation – As student schedules get busier they demand
more online learning opportunities. Having a sound
instructional design process ensures that the program will
maintain its reputation for high-quality learning regardless
of the delivery format.
There are many Instructional Design System (ISD) models used
in different contexts and fields. Following are just a few of the
most commonly used models:
• Successive Approximation Model (SAM)
• Understanding by Design (UbD) Framework (Backwards
Design)
• ADDIE

99 | 4. Instructional Design Principles

• Dick and Carey Design Model
All of these models have the same main factors in common:
1. START WITH – Goals and Context Analysis Step: Start with
the goals: what do we want to achieve? Where will the
learning take place? With what tools?
2. NEXT EVALUATE – Assessment Determination Step:
Analyze or design how the student will prove they have
achieved the learning; what will be assessed, thus leading
to the assessment strategy or required performance
criteria.
3. THEN CREATE – Design Step: Determine the most
important learning content, delivery platform, and tools, so
as to achieve these previous two items.
4. FINALLY – Develop and Implement (including revision):
Create the learning objects, and use them with
participants, and through feedback revise, redesign/
develop, and improve as needed.
Successive Approximation Model (SAM)
This eBook will focus on the SAM Model, though recognizing
that all the models listed above have similar function and basic
factors, so aspects of the other design models mentioned make
their way into the descriptions of each SAM step since they all
cover much of the same design criteria.
The simplified SAM model follows the following three main
steps, and a discussion in greater detail will follow
Key Concept: Be choosy when deciding on tools during the
design process.
The flexibility afforded by eLearning makes it possible to
include the latest technological developments accessible online.

4. Instructional Design Principles | 100

Among these are Web 2.0 tools such as wikis, blogs, social
groups, RSS, video, podcasts, tagging and other sociallygenerated media on the Internet. But it is important to make
the right tool choices for the right needs and for the right
context. Do not use any tool just for the sake of using a tool.
Make smart curriculum-based tool choices that fit into the
instructional design and that map back to the learning goals to
directly support student learning.

Tweet why being choosy matters or about one of the
important factors in the design process.

Section 3: SAM Overview
The SAM model follows some of the proceeding main concepts:
Learning is not static, therefore neither should instructional
design methods be. Learning is never a linear path. “Boring
instruction is costly, damaging, ineffective, and wasteful” (Allen
& Sites, 2012, p. 4). Learning should be a circular process that
is always repeating, analyzing, and improving. It should allow
for agile creativity throughout the process such that, based on
feedback, the teacher can easily improve the process and
products without having to start over. The steps used are
secondary to the quality of the learning result. Media, delivery
format, and educational tools are a means to an end, learning
achievement. Defining learning achievement is difficult as it
varies from person to person, school to school, topic to topic,

101 | 4. Instructional Design Principles

culture to culture, and country to country. For the sake of this
eBook, learning achievement is described as context-based
relevant skills useful to the student’s life, interests, and
environment. The learning product and format is less important
than learning achievement, which is based on the learning
goals, processes, and results.
SAM is an evolution of ADDIE. Allen outlines the need for a
new model that can be more agile and that allows for more
creativity in the process, where one should analyze the learning
product desired before defining the process for obtaining that
product. “The goal is always about performance. What can
people do with their new knowledge? What skills are necessary
for success?” (p. XX). Like the last two models analyzed, this one
focuses on the goals before designing the learning materials. It
“begins with the end in mind” since “It is impossible to define
the best path to traverse if you don’t know where you are going”
(Allen & Sites, 2012, p. XX). As advertised, the SAM model is a
modern and agile process allowing for quick creativity on the fly
The following figure is the full SAM model:

individual courses, a model that breaks the design process down
into three main steps.

Section 4: SAM Step 1: Evaluate
The first step is to evaluate the needs, goals, required
competencies, context, content, and learners, and to determine
how the learners can show proof of learning acquisition.
Following are some questions to ask during this step:
• Who is the target audience?
• What are the learning needs?
• What is the learning context?
• What will be the delivery type?
• What are the learner technology skills? What technology
help will they require?
• Will there be prerequisite skills to provide? What tutorials
will be needed for them to be successful with the
technology or tools used in the course?
• What type of Internet and course access will the learners
have?
• What should students be able to DO as a consequence of
the learning?
• What should students be able to KNOW as a consequence
of the learning?
• What should students be able to UNDERSTAND as a
consequence of the learning?
• What types of assessments will show proof of
achievement?
Organizational Considerations
In

addition

to

measurable

and

appropriate

course-level

outcomes, online course developers need to consider a design
that is consistent with either a developer’s other online

4. Instructional Design Principles | 104

course(s), with other departmental courses, and/or courses
within the same division. Working towards a common design
template can aid students when discovering the purpose and
structure of online courses. If structure and organization are at
least similar across different courses, then students need not
waste additional time re-learning such things as course
navigation and can focus on what is important – the course
content (Simonson, Smaldino, & Zvacek, 2015).
Learning Outcomes
The course developer should begin the design process with
measurable and clearly written course-level outcomes that will
be mapped or aligned to all assessments, instructional
materials, activities, and technologies utilized in the course
(Allen & Sites, 2012; Simonson, Smaldino, & Zvacek, 2015). When
drafting course-level outcomes, it is helpful to review Bloom’s
Taxonomy for appropriate and measurable learning outcomes
verbs. It is important to write course-level outcomes that are
not only measurable, but that are also suited to the level of the
course. This means that course-level outcomes that use verbs
such as “assemble” or “synthesize” are often not suitable for a
low level introduction course.

Section 5: SAM Step 2: Design
This step is where all the learning processes and products are
designed. The story boards for videos and screencasts are
created. The types of assessments and assignments are
outlined. The overall course organization, layout, and order are
visualized. You create the design of your course, unit, or module.
Some important factors in the design stage are:
• Chunking of content
• Organization of the course content into the online course
• Planning the learning processes vs products
• Creating story boards of videos and screencasts
• Determining how student learning will be assessed
• Finalizing the order of the course topics
And some important design considerations are:
• Technology Considerations:
◦ File Types: Try to use universal file types that people
can open on any device, such as a PDF file type or the
eBook file type
◦ Prerequisite Skills: Design in tutorials and guides for
any skills students need to do the course assign- ments.
◦ File Size: From the evaluation step, know what type of
Internet access students will have, and make sure that
file sizes are not too large for them to download. If
possible embed or stream items already on the web,
making learner access easier as they do not have to
download the content at
◦ Accessibility: Think about not only learning challenge
access to the course content, but also about different

4. Instructional Design Principles | 108

learning
◦ Second Language Learners: Think about the
understanding of second language learners and make
sure that directions are accessible for all.
◦ Mobility: Learners like to be able to access their content
from multiple devices and locations. Think about ways
to make the content more mobile-ready.
• Interactivity Considerations:
◦ Peer-to-Peer: Design in ways for the students to
connect, share, and help each More peer-to-peer
sharing will lower dropout rates and improve student
satisfaction.
◦ Peer-to-Professor: Design in multiple ways for the
students to connect with the instructor for
◦ Communication Strategies: Design in ways for
students to get announcements, tutoring, help, and
information about the course on a weekly
◦ Multiple learning Approaches: Design in ways for the
students to learn the same topics in different ways so as
to attend to different learningInteractivity
Considerations:
◦ Tool and Method Substitution: Have a backup plan for
tools and software so that if one is not working, another
can be introduced in its place.
• Layout Considerations:
◦ Chunking of Content: Make sure that the directions,
rubrics, videos, and content students need to complete
a given task or assignment are all chunked and
organized together. Do not make them go searching
around the course to try and find what they
◦ 2-3 Clicks: No content in a course should be more than
3 clicks down. At that point it is too deep and will be
very hard for the learner to Content that can be 2 clicks

109 | 4. Instructional Design Principles

or less to get to from the main page is much easier for
learners to locate.
◦ Learning Nuggets: Break learning topics down into
“bite-sized” learning nuggets. An hour long video can
be broken down into 10-minute subtopics, or a lecture
can be broken down into 15-minute And make it easy
for students to mark where they have left off, and
return to it later.
◦ Colors: Think not only about Universal Access when
choosing colors in a course, but also about eye strain.
Red-on-black might seem like a good idea but learners
will not thank you for
◦ Flow: Think about the organization, ordering, and
layout of the content. Items should be in logical places,
and topics organized in a reasonable flow of content. In
a face-to-face course the instructor can guide the
learning through the content and manage the flow of
content, but in the online course the student must be
able to do that
◦ Scrolling: Avoid the long page of never-ending
scrolling. It is too hard for learners to find what they
need. Concise, short, simple to read, follow and find
content is the
◦ Autonomy: Design for learner autonomy. This is
essential! The instructor is not present to help guide
student learning in the online course, so students need
to easily be able to do it They should have access to all
they need to be successful.
• Quality Considerations:
◦ Equivalency: This eBook will repeat this important
factor time and again because it is a key All online and
blended learning should have equivalent learning
experiences to the face-to-face course.

4. Instructional Design Principles | 110

◦ Hands-On: Design in ways for students to get hands-on
experiential If the face-to-face course took a field trip to
a National Park, then have them go to one on their own
or with their family, and take pictures to share in a
discussion forum. There are many ways to design in
personal learning experiences for the students.
◦ Real Learning: Remove fluff and filler. That is the reason
this eBook advocates the backwards design approach.
Start with the elearning goals and map all learning
experiences, assignments, and assessments directly to
the learning outcomes and required competencies.
This way learners are not wasting their time.
◦ Community Connections: This eBook has an entire
section dedicated to building strong online learning
communities which, in turn, support student success
and help reduce dropout
◦ Avoid Plagiarism: The best way to avoid cheating is to
create assignments and assessments that are so
interesting and personalized that students cannot
cheat. Good design prevents plagiarism.
Online Course Organization
When considering the organization of a course, it is helpful to
know what options are available to course developers within the
LMS. If it is clear that the instructor will be providing a significant
amount of content that isn’t from a textbook, then various LMS
objects could be used to better organize and present the
information beyond simply uploading individual files. Providing
alternate means of accessing the same information will also
meet quality elearning standards regarding accessibility and
usability criteria.

Section 7: Interview With An Expert

Dr. Michael Simonson: U – M – T
Design Approach
Dr. Simonson is a program professor in the Instructional
Technology and Distance Education program with Nova
Southeastern University. Here he shares his preferred
design approach for a university level 3-credit semester
course:
In the traditional university, the 50-minute class session
is the building block for courses. Usually, 15 classes are
offered for each semester credit, and a 3-credit college
course would have 45 class sessions in a 16 week
semester. Distance delivered courses often do not have
class sessions. It is proposed that the topic be the
fundamental building block for instruction. Topics are
organized into modules that are further organized into
units that are roughly equivalent to a semester/course
credit traditionally offered using 15, 50-minute class
sessions (Orellana, Hudgins & Simonson, 2009).
When courses are planned, the designer might want to
use the Unit, Module, and Topic approach or model (UMT
approach), as explained next. Unit, Module, Topic
Guideline:
• Each semester credit = 1 unit
• Each unit = 3-5 modules

113 | 4. Instructional Design Principles

• Each module = 3-5 topics
A typical three-credit course has 3 units, 12 modules, and
48 topics. Working definitions of unit, module, and topic
are as follows:
• Unit. A unit is a significant body of knowledge that
represents a major subdivision of a course’s
content. Often, one unit of a course would
represent 4 or 5 weeks of instruction, and would be
equivalent to a semester credit. For example, a unit
in an educational statistics course might be
Descriptive Statistics.
• Module. A module is a major subdivision of a unit.
A module is a distinct and discreet component of a
unit. Generally, a unit such as Descriptive Statistics
might be divided into three to five major
components, such as Statistical Assumptions,
Measures of Central Tendency, Measures of
Variation, and the Normal Curve. Modules
generally are the basis for several class sessions
and are covered in about a week of instruction and
study in a typical 15 week college semester.
•

Topic. A topic is an important supporting idea
that explains, clarifies, or supports a module. A
topic would be a lesson or an assignment. Topics in
a module on Central Tendency might be Median,
Mode, and Mean. These three terms can be used in
a variety of ways. Of importance is the idea that
topics form modules, modules form units, and

4. Instructional Design Principles | 114

units are the main subdivisions of courses.

End-of-Chapter Resources

CRITICAL THINKING
1. What course product types (videos, handouts,
quizzes, learning objects, etc) are best suited to
which learning processes (Project based learning,
inquiry based learning, etc)? Are some products
the best choice for a given learning process?
2. Take a learning outcome for your course and look
at the Bloom’s Taxonomy graphic and table in this
chapter. What action verbs are used in your
learning outcome? What level of Bloom’s
Taxonomy is expected of the students? What types
of activities or assessments would suit the learning
level?
3. What learning processes best suit your course?
Which products would you choose to use?

Video 3-1: What is Blended Learning

What Is Blended Learning
Blended learning is a mixture of face-to-face time and online
time in a class. Blended learning can include anywhere from
20 to 80% of the course time online. Blended learning offers

123 | 5. Blended Learning Design

the instructor the opportunity to extend the learning outside of
the classroom, thus increasing the opportunities for students to
connect to each other, as well as the chance to utilize a wider
array of online resources and technologies to enhance the
classroom time.
Some of the common tools used to enhance a blended course:
• Videos online at services such as YouTube
• Bookmarking tools and online resource lists
• Social groups
• Course lecture and tutorials (flipped learning)
• Podcasts and interviews with experts in the field
• Interactive Digital Learning Objects (DLOs) at Open
Educational Resource (OER) sites such as MERLOT
One example of this would be when faculty use online
discussions to expand on discussions that started in the
classroom. The instructor may use 30 minutes of one lecture to
get a debate started, and then have the students continue that
same discussion in an online discussion forum for the rest of the
week. This allows the students an opportunity to delve deeper
and longer into the topic they are discussing and to spend time
looking up resources and information to enhance the quality
of their points. This is an excellent blended learning tactic that
helps advance the students learning in meaningful directions.
As you read this chapter, consider how a stakeholder group
might view blended learning and what you might tell members
of that group (in under 100 words) to help them in
understanding what it is. Identify the stakeholder group who is
the audience for your message (students, colleagues, families,
employers, the public, leaders, officials, etc.)

.
The following definition of blended learning is provided by
The Innosight Institute (2011): “Blended learning is any time
a student learns at least in part at a supervised brick-andmortar location away from home and at least in part through
online delivery with some element of student control over
time, place, path, and/or pace.” Another way to think about
blended learning is that it represents a shift of “school” or
“college” from being a site where learning happens in specific
spaces at regular times, to a flexible service in which students
may engage in a great many times and places (Cavanaugh
Hargis, 2010). This site-to-service shift includes several changes
that are emerging as influences on the design and delivery of
education, as shown in Table 3-1.

3-2 Video: Flipped Learning
The most recent models of blended learning reaffirm the
proven learning design principle of a consistent vision and
purpose that is reflected in consistent design, from the
organization level through the lesson level (Ferdig, Cavanaugh, &
Freidhoff, 2012). Key lessons from successful blended education
programs are that successful blended programs have direction,
were created for a reason, and all decisions about the designs in
the program adhere to the overarching direction and purpose
and are expressed consistently throughout a course and

127 | 5. Blended Learning Design

program, both conceptually and visually. The internal or external
benchmarks, design standards, and development templates
may be adopted to ensure this consistency. Many schools use

Classroom Learning + Online Learning = Blended Learning
There are some important considerations to think about when
designing blended learning modules for a course. Here are a few
of those considerations to keep in mind as you progress:
1. Technology skills: Make sure students know how to use any
technology implemented as a part of the course. For
example, if you have students create a video for a project,
be sure to include directions on how to use a video editing
software with guides and tutorials to actually using the

5. Blended Learning Design | 128

technology they need in order to complete that
assignment.
2. Technology access: Double-check that students can
access, open, download, and use any resources used online.
For example, if many have slow Internet connections at
home, then don’t put PowerPoint slides online with a lot of
photos, as it will make it a very large file size which is hard
for them to download.
3. Accessibility: Design online learning components with
universal access and different learning styles in mind. For
example, on videos, include a transcript that students can
read instead of listening to the video. This helps secondlanguage learners have better access to the learning
content as well.
Suitable Tasks
As in all educational design, some tasks are well suited to some
learning environments, and not so much to other learning
contexts. It is good to make lists of which tasks in your course
will be well suited to the online portion of the blended course
vs. the face-to-face portion. Be sure to consider Bloom’s Digital
Taxonomy and the Periodic Table of Visualization as you read
this section.
The classroom environment is well suited for:
• Discussion of abstract content, brainstorming, and
planning
• Guest speakers who are nearby
• Practicing interpersonal skills and presentations
• Discussion of practices and processes
• Review of assignments
• Group discussions, role play, debate, speaking practice

129 | 5. Blended Learning Design

• Providing practice and feedback to students on complex or
ill-defined tasks
• Hands-on learning requiring the use of specialized
materials that are difficult to obtain or use without
instructor supervision
The online environment is well-suited for:
• Reading and asynchronous discussion
• Synchronous sessions with remote guests
• Team project development in online space
• Peer review
• Video and text-based cases
• Reading and asynchronous discussion
• Video and other media
• Presentations as background for skill development
• Repeated practice with concepts and skills using tools that
allow students to work at their own pace, including with
interactive manipulatives, games, and simulations
• Reading, viewing and listening, followed by independent
reflection
• Connecting virtually for conversations and mentoring and
remove students or experts, conducing web surveys, or
online book groups
• Working on multi-media projects and sharing them with a
wide audience
• Learning from and creating graphic organizers
• Individualized tutoring with synchronous communication
tools and cyber study groups
• Knowledge checks using quizzes with automated feedback
• Peer review of student work

5. Blended Learning Design | 130

Flipped Learning
Flipped learning is a type of learning in which the instructor
puts lecture videos and materials online for the students to do
on their own time prior to coming to class, thus leaving the class
time for the students to be able to do interactive instructorled learning activities and group work which offer the students
a chance to apply what they are learning in the class in an
expert-supported environment. Many feel this is a much better
use of classroom time than only having the instructor stand at
the front and lecture on information that students can easily
view and learn before coming to class. Flipped learning is a
type of blended learning design approach that capitalizes on
technology to help enhance the quality of the face-to-face
instructional time.
Design Strategies
Begin with the end in mind, as with any learning design effort.
Specify what a successful learner knows and can DO at the
end of the lesson, unit, or course. Create a step-by-step plan for
scaffolding learners from their likely entry point to the desired
exit point. Align all activities and assessment along this learning
pathway. Blended courses are ideally suited to alternate
between rich interaction, frequent feedback, and periodic
reflection on learning. Think of ways to seamlessly integrate a
complete developmental learning experience using the two
learning environments

Planning the Course
• Design sequences of activities in a continuum so that the
online materials and time between class meetings support
the classroom time by preparing students for classroom
activities and following up on classroom activities.
• Build flexibility into timelines and activities to get the
benefits of the online time between class meetings.
• Focus on the sequences and strategies that are best for
learning rather than focusing on the technology. Select the
appropriate technology for the learners and the learning,
with a preference for technology that is simple and
effective rather than flashy.
• Test online materials and run practice sessions with the
synchronous technology.

5. Blended Learning Design | 132

• Provide an orientation or trial session for online tests,
meetings, and other components that may be new for
students.
• Plan each course, each week, and each session using a
detailed timeline.
• Create policies and protocols and communicate them to
students related to timelines for your response to their
contacts and assignment submissions.
• Develop clear and consistent protocols for student
participation in online discussions.
• Tightly align course goals, objectives/outcomes, materials,
and assessments.

Through connections with peers in learning interactions,
student knowledge can be expanded and built upon. Peer- topeer interactions are important to help students learn from

There are many ways to implement interactive tools into your
blended learning course:
1. Focus on dialogue, interaction, reflection, and collaborative
activities.
2. Strive for teaching presence in online materials.
3. Learn the methods of communication that are preferred for
students in between classroom sessions so they never feel
abandoned.
4. Lean toward over-communication in between classroom
meetings to increase clarity and understanding.
5. Provide examples for exemplary student discussion replies,
assignments, and projects.
6. Develop online tutorials as necessary.
When creating the flow of events in the course, consider Gradual
Release of Responsibility (Fisher Frey, 2008). Early sessions and
activities should be sequenced in smaller chunks to develop
foundational knowledge and skills with more instructor
leadership, feedback, and concrete examples.

135 | 5. Blended Learning Design

Figure 2

In effect, the learning should scaffold independence and allow
for more student autonomy as their knowledge increases. As
the course continues, work can become more conceptual and
complex. Students can work more independently and the
instructor role should transition to that of a tutor or mentor.
Finally, students should lead activities and presentations as the
course culminates.
Summary
Blended learning is any time a student learns, at least in part,
at a supervised brick-and-mortar location away from home and,
at least in part, through online delivery with some element of
student control over time, place, path, and/or pace. There are

5. Blended Learning Design | 136

tasks well suited to blended learning design such as discussions
that expand talks outside the classroom, bringing in remote
guests, team work, collaboration on projects, integration of
video and media, and access to online resources and tools. Use
a design framework to guide the creation of the online portion
of the course. Choose appropriate tools that enhance learning
rather than detract. All decisions about the designs in the
program adhere to the overarching direction and purpose.

CRITICAL THINKING
1. What is flipped learning, and how can this learning
strategy be applied to your course?
2. In your course, what types of activities can easily be
moved to the online delivery format, and which are
best suited to the classroom time?

137 | 5. Blended Learning Design

3. What types of interactivity can be designed into
your unit plan that will provide students with
opportunities for peer-to-peer learning?

CHAPTER TASK
The task is to design a blended learning lesson/unit for
your course.
Consider the key concepts from the blended learning
chapter, then think about your own experiences with
blended learning. Choose a lesson, unit, or other
component of a course that you would like to redesign
systematically as a blended component. Then complete
each task below after reading this chapter. Create an
outline for a lesson from a class including topics, content
for each topic, and teaching strategies. Decide which
elements of the lesson will be face-to-face and which will
be blended. Provide a brief rationale for your decisions.
The readings will lead you through this design process
from start to finish.
Complete the following tasks after reading each section
in this chapter:
1. Section 1: Identify a lesson or activity in a course
you teach or you will teach to redesign and add

5. Blended Learning Design | 138

interaction as if time and space were not
limitations. Use the learning objectives and
assessments to brainstorm the optimal activities
that would take the students from their entry state
to a high level of achievement of the objectives.
What is the ideal sequence and pace for these
activities? Review the table called “Blended
Learning Plan” in chapter 4.1. Complete your own
table with specific examples of how you will
redesign the activity to fit the blended learning
format.
• Once done, you have just done the basic steps of
blended learning design: content analysis and the
overall design of the learning experience!
2. Section 2: Sort the activities you named in the first
task into those well-suited for the physical learning
environment and those well-suited for the virtual
learning environment. Refine the activities to
integrate media. Develop formative assessments
for key points in the activities. Remember to add
details, policies, procedures, expectations, and
grading rubrics. Points to keep in mind as you
complete this task: Be sure to outline how you
would apply the “flipped classroom concept” to the
activity you identified, how you will change the
activity to a blended-learning format, and how will
you assess whether learners completed the
activity.

139 | 5. Blended Learning Design

◦ You have now added to your analysis and
design by beginning the development step in
blended learning design!
3. Section 3: Choose one or more new tools for the
activities you have developed for your blended
learning module. Consider how your plan may be
adapted to increase student responsibility later in
the lesson/unit. Write up a graduated, step-by-step,
scaffolded plan for the student’s learning from the
start of the unit, when you will mentor and guide
them more, to the end when they should be able
to show more autonomy on the topics. If you will
expect students to learn to use and apply a new
tool, then write specific step-by-step instructions
for the use of tool, and provide an example of how
learners will be expected to apply the tool
autonomously by the end of the unit.

By Deakin University
Introduction

There are many benefits to having online
discussions even in a face-to-face (f2f) course.
From fully f2f to blended to fully online, the
students can expand their learning outside the
classroom through interactive dialogue with

6. Effective Online Discussions | 146

their peers and the instructor. An online
discussion is very similar to a f2f talk in that they
require moderation and active management by
the
instructor,
preparation
time,
and
summarization of the concepts covered. In this
learning guide an online discussion is defined as
communication between instructors and
students using interactive communication
tools. These tools can take many forms, from
chat sessions, to discussion forums, to video chat.
The value of the online discussion is that even
those students who are shy and timid can find
the time to express their views, and more indepth dialogue between students-students can
occur.
Benefits of Online Discussions
• Work Quality. If the instructor makes the expectations and
requirements clear then, given that students have time to
reflect on their discussion contributions before posting,
they can offer more resources and interesting facts than
they could in a f2f talk on the same topic, thus increasing
the quality of the discussions.
• Preparation. In a f2f discussion the students may or may
not have prepared or read the material, but in online
discussions they always have time to look up the
information and study the item prior to posting a response
about it, particularly useful for ESL students who may need
extra time to prepare in advance of discussions.
• Netiquette. In the new millennium we are all faced with
having to learn a whole new set of social communica- tion

147 | 6. Effective Online Discussions

skills: how to politely discuss topics in the online format. The
instructor is integral in helping the students find their
online voices and personalities in a polite and socially
acceptable manner that is conducive to a warm and
inviting learning community for all; a skill the students will
use in their personal and professional lives too as
technology for communication use expands.
• Writing Skills. If the instructor has high expectations on the
quality of the writing that students post, then students will
have the opportunity to improve on their writing skills. This
can be an essential practice of writing for ESL students.
• Active Management. As the instructor follows student
discussion threads, they can see misconceptions or logical
errors and fallacies right as they occur and offer the
information or guidance students need to stay on the right
learning path in class.
• Equal Chances. In a f2f discussion there is limited time for
everyone to talk; as soon the class discussion time is over,
the discussion is over. The online format is a great place to
continue the classroom discussions thus allowing all the
students, even the shy or timid, a chance to have their say.
This also allows students to participate at the same time in
multiple lines of thought (threads) within the same
discussion theme.
•

Global Connections. Some online course
discussions are conducted across different
course sections at the same campus, or
across several campuses, or even between
the same course at two different universities
in the same or different countries. These
kinds of online global connections allow the
students a chance to improve on their

6. Effective Online Discussions | 148

cultural perspectives and to network
internationally.
• Expanding Classroom Learning. A classroom discussion
can only last as long as the class hours allow and may take
time away from lectures and other activities that the
instructor needs to give to the students. Having online
discussions on the course lectures allows the instructor to
continue course discussions even once the f2f time is over.
It can also be a great way for students to integrate learning
from classroom lectures into discussion conducted online.
Many students have said that they write their posts in MS Word
first to check for grammar and spelling before posting them to
be viewed by other students. When asked why, some said they
don’t mind making mistakes when submitting writing to the
instructor as he/she is an expert in this area, so is used to seeing
errors! When submitting threaded posts in the discussion forum
however, they feel their writing should be as flawless as possible
so their peers will think well of them. – Triona Finucane

Section 2: Instructor Presence

A YouTube element has been excluded from this version of
the text. You can view it online here: http://oer.edbeck.com/virtuallearningdesigndelivery/?p=50

A commonly held myth is that technology could replace the
instructor, or that online learning does not need an instructor.
In reality the instructor is as much of a requirement in online
learning as in face-to-face (f2f) learning, just in different ways.
The role of the instructor changes from a learning guide to a
learning facilitator, and the presence of the instructor to support
learning in the online delivery mode is essential to student
satisfaction.
There is no one-size-fits-all approach to when an instructor
should use online discussions, how often, and how much they

6. Effective Online Discussions | 150

should interact within the discussions. The instructor should
evaluate their students’ needs on a case-by-case basis. For
example, how often the instructor ought to reply in the online
discussion forums can vary based on a great many factors, such
as:
• Level of the students: New students and beginners may
require more interaction than higher level or graduate
students, who may prefer to lead the discussion themselves
and to learn from each other as much as from the
instructor.
• Topic: Some topics might require more management and
guidance by the instructor than others.
•

Discussion type: You will learn of different
kinds of discussions that can be utilized, and
different ones would require different levels
of interaction by the instructor.

What the Research Says
Research supports two interesting results that could conflict
with each other in practice; that instructor presence is key to
student satisfaction,and that too much interaction and posting
by the instructor in discussions can lead to reduced posting by
the students (Wang and Liang, 2011).
Students claim higher satisfaction in courses that have higher
instructor presence and availability (Picciano, 2002; Richardson
& Swan, 2003; Shea, Li, & Pickett, 2006; Blau, 2009). On the
other

hand,

because

the

instructor

is

considered

an

authoritarian figure (Rourke & Anderson, 2002), studies have
found that the sooner, and more often, an instructor posted in
the discussion forums, then the less frequent and shorter were
the posts by the students (Dennen, 2005, Mazzolini & Maddison,

151 | 6. Effective Online Discussions

2003). Students require some time to start and to feel confident
in expressing their views with each other before the instructor
begins to interact with them, otherwise they will just reply to the
instructor, and not to each other (Wang and Liang, 2011).
Directed Tactics
Wang and Liang (2011) outlined several methods specifically
focused on dealing with this dilemma:
1. Regulating: The course designer can help regulate student
interactions by creating and implementing clear rules and
policies related to the discussion board posts and replies.
This includes quantitative rules about how often to post, by
when, and to whom. It also includes qualitative rules about
the content and quality of the posts and replies.
2.

3.

Inviting: The instructor makes it clear to the
student how to contact them for help,
guidance, questions, and support on the
discussion topics. This can be a separate
online forum for building discussions
between the instructor and students, which
is away from the course topic discussions in
which the instructor hopes the students will
teach each other. This is often called the
’Virtual Office.’
Summarizing: The instructor is integral in
summarizing the student discussions and
going over main points and important
conclusions. Putting in direct examples from
the discussion is very useful and gives credit
to high quality interactions. This helps the

6. Effective Online Discussions | 152

4.

5.

students in summarizing their own learning,
as well as lets them know clearly that they
were being monitored throughout the
process.
Assessing: Formative assessments and
feedback help students to improve their
performance during the course. Offering
feedback on the quality of the posts with
examples of expectations helps students to
meet the instructor’s expectations and to
improve on the quality of their interactions
with their peers.
Counseling: The instructor should let the
students know they are there to support
them, and be in frequent contact with the
student through means other than just the
discussion forums. They can send out
updates by email and give students many
ways to contact them, through a special
instructor-student Virtual Office discussion
forum (as outlined in #2) in the course, by
email, phone, chat, in person-to-person
office hours, and any other means of
communication the instructor is able to offer
students.

Avoiding Burnout
In the f2f classroom, the instructor manages 20+ students in
a discussion at the same time, in one hour, and then is done.
In the online discussions the conversations can go on longer,

153 | 6. Effective Online Discussions

expand and break up into multiple conversation lines, and the
instructor may begin to feel overwhelmed by the number of
replies they need to manage. Here are some tips and tricks to
managing online discussions that avoid work overload:
• Save save save! If you write up a thoughtful, well supported
and referenced reply on a given topic, chances are you will
use it again the next time you teach that same topic and
course. Save it in a file to be reused. Save anything you
might reuse, and save yourself time in the future.
•

Reply to multiple students at the same
time. Do not reply to each student with the
same information or weblink. Instead, try to
get them onto the same thread and reply to
them all there. If you wait a day or two and
reply to a thread between 2-4 students, then you make one
reply to four students at the same time.
◦ Example 1: Hello John, Jane, Mary and Susan. You have
some interesting points about XX, and also about XX.
Have you considered XX? What do you think?
◦ Example 2: Hello John. I see you are discussing the
same topic as I replied to Mary with some interesting
facts and sources. Check that out, and reply to let us
know what you think.

• Set Work Hours. Online discussions are always there. It can
invade the rest of your life until you find you are logging
into the course far too often. Set specific hours when you
will login into your online course and check the discussions,
and stick to that schedule. Try to not login outside those set
hours to avoid burnout.
• Quality vs. Quantity: Replying to all students in the course
with fluff and low quality replies is far less advantageous to

6. Effective Online Discussions | 154

their learning than making a few directed, specific, and
high quality replies. Make it clear to students that a reply to
one student is always open to discussion by the entire class.
• Pick Your Battles. Don’t spend hours writing up a
thoughtful, in-depth tutorial, post, or help guide unless you
can reuse it with other students in the future; try to find the
same thing online already written and give them that link
instead. Finally, don’t spend hours on thoughtful feedback
for a student’s post where the student very clearly did not
spend even five minutes writing it.

By The University of New South Wales
Here we provide a list of strategies and methods that help
improve the quality of online learning discussions.
Make the Discussion Post Directions Clear and Concise. For
example, specify the minimum words or referencing required,
and clearly state the due date. Create a high quality discussion
question that requires they use critical thinking to integrate
course concepts in place of just listing out answers they can
copy online.
Make the Value Clear. Explain at the start of the course the
reason and value of the discussions, and outline the discussion

6. Effective Online Discussions | 156

methods you will use. If students perceive the value they will
make them a priority.
Make it Worth Something. If it is not graded, students are
not likely to give it enough attention. Discussion can be an
important and integral part of student learning and writing
practice. Make both the initial posts and their participation
replies an adequate percent of the total grade. Experts in the
field recommend that discussion participation should equal
anywhere from 10-30% of the entire grade if students are to take
them seriously.
Clearly State Participation Requirements. Many instructors
will specify the minimum number of replies each student
should make, how many days a week posts and replies should
be made on (to show attendance), and the level of quality the
reply content should have (meaning replies of just ’I agree’ and
nothing more are not counted as participation). It is very useful
to give students examples of what a high quality reply should
look like. Giving students a grading rubric that outlines what is
expected and how they will be graded allows them to meet the
instructor’s expectations.
Promote Interactive Feedback: The instructor should outline
that substantive feedback is required for participation points
(such as replies of ’I Agree’ and nothing more will not constitute
a part of graded participation). Note that not all replies will be
substantive, and sometimes all we need to say is “Great job,
I agree.” Don’t discourage this kind of positive support, just
inform students that they must also have a minimum number
of substantive replies as well. Giving students examples of what
substantive feedback looks like can help them interact at the
discussions in an advanced way. Substantive feedback usually
includes one or more of the following elements:
•

Asking questions about the original post

•

Pointing out (respectfully) possible errors in the original

157 | 6. Effective Online Discussions

post, and offering up a source of information on the topic for
further discussion
•

Sharing of links, videos, and other online resources on the

topic to expand further discussion
•

Sharing of personal experiences relevant to the topic

•

Respectfully disagreeing, and then sharing an alternative

viewpoint
•

Using reliable support, facts, and information to support

arguments and points
Create a Permanent Discussion Schedule. A professor can
schedule regular and consistent start and end dates

of

discussions to keep students on track. Setting early due dates on
the posts allows students enough time to reply before the end
of the discussions. Making the discussion schedule a permanent
part of the syllabus allows students to plan their time effectively.
Lead by Example. If you expect students to make posts and
replies at least three days of the week, so should the professor
as the model. The instructor’s posts should be high quality,
referenced, and academic, thus becoming a guide of what is
expected.
•

Example: Always make the initial discussion post due on

Tuesdays by midnight and the replies due on three days of the
week, the final ones in by Sunday night. These permanent due
dates week after week help to keep the students organized and
able to meet the deadlines.
Alleviate Isolation and Distance. In blended or online
learning, students may feel less socially connected to the
instructor and course which can lead to higher dropout rates.
See the section in this chapter on Building a Learning
Community for tips on reducing this.
Encourage Dialogues. Avoid dominating the conversation or
telling students ’how it is’ and instead guide learning in
appropriate directions through the Advancing Discussion

6. Effective Online Discussions | 158

tactics covered in this chapter. Manage dominate students so
that timid ones feel they have the space to share.
Appropriate Group Size. Research shows that groups of less
than eight people will probably stagnate from lack of
interaction, but so too will groups over 15 people as students feel
overwhelmed by the number of posts in the forum. If the course
numbers allow it, then create smaller discussion groups of 10-15
people. A good tactic is to then employ the ’Cross-pollination’
method discussed in this module.
Mid and End of discussion Summaries. Halfway through a
discussion post a review of general conclusions being made by
students, as well as to clarify any misconceptions and to keep
students on track. Post an end-of-discussion summary to wrap
up all of the main points and to make important conclusions the
students may not have yet realized.
Align Discussions with Learning Outcomes. Design the
discussion questions such that they relate directly back to the
course learning outcomes. This way the students are spending
their limited time on focused and useful discussions relevant to
course learning goals.
In cases where a large majority or most of the students in the
course are second-language speakers, this can present a unique
challenge for the instructor. The instructor may need to spend a
bit more time supporting students in the discussions, or offering
summaries of new words and expressions learned via email after
the discussions.
The instructor can do pre-discussion work with the students
to prepare them for the discussion language needs in advance,
such as with a vocabulary exercise, activity, or tutorial on the
required vocabulary and expressions that will be required in
the upcoming discussions. These tutorials, help sheets, and
vocabulary lists can also be posted online in the discussions

159 | 6. Effective Online Discussions

or learning management system (LMS) where the discussions
will take place, allowing for a quick review by students when
necessary. Finally, create a glossary of terms in the course, which
will be essential so that students can refer often to it when
unsure of the language used in the forums.

By Dr. Bonk, Indiana University
As we have read in previous sections, the instructor must find
a special balance between being too interactive and not being
interactive enough. Following are some indirect ways of pushing
and advancing student learning in the discussions without
always appearing to be directing them.
Questioning Strategies: There are a variety of questioning
strategies, such as Socratic questioning, that allow the instructor
to help push student learning in online courses. The idea is that
through asking the students specific questions about what they
say, they will eventually lead themselves to the right answer. The
following research paper covers these strategies in detail.

161 | 6. Effective Online Discussions

Lead the Horse to Water: You will quickly note that some
students have missed the point, missed a needed conclusion,
have a misconception, or just do not know their facts. This could
be due to prior learning that is a barrier to them learning new
information, due to them just reading an erroneous source
online, or because they did not prepare for class. It is important
to catch these discussion errors and moderate them early so
that other students in the same course are not also erroneously
led along the same logical fallacies. The problem, though, always
rests in that people do not like to be told they are wrong. If you
reply “that is wrong” the student is likely to feel publicly attacked
in front of their peers and will either become defensive, or close
up and not post anything more. Therefore, there are more subtle
and indirect ways of leading the student to the right information
without directly telling them.
Example: John writes “Climate change is just a hoax
propagated by crazy environmentalists that want to prohibit the
smooth running of our economy.”
Problems with the post: Hearsay. Unfounded. Jargon. Not
academic. Claims without support. False information contrary
to what experts in the field and the textbook say. The issue,
though, is that climate change is a sensitive and heated subject.
The professor would need to find an innovative indirect way
of getting the student to learn the right material on their own
because telling them is probably going to make them angry or
defensive.
Ways the instructor might reply:
• Hello John. Thank you for your post. You made some claims
but did not offer support or facts to back them up. Can you
reply to me here with some specific facts and resources to
support your points? What does our book say on the topic?
• Hello John. Thank you for your post. I would like to direct

6. Effective Online Discussions | 162

you to pg XX in our textbook. Read that page. What does
the author say on this topic? What do you think?
• Hello John. Thank you for your post. I think that NASA has
some very interesting data concerning climate change.
Take a look at this link and tell me what you think?

http://climate.nasa.gov/
Create Connections: Reply to student threads with useful
resources, information, and relevant topics that help them
connect their learning.
• You wrote about X, and at this weblink/online-resource they
say X, what do you think?
• This reminds me of. . .
• Did you see that X wrote on this, what did you think of his/
her conclusions?
• Go view this X thread, as it relates to what you say here on X.

• I see you talked about X, how does that relate to X on pg X
of our book?

Advanced Discussion Methods to Expand Learning
Following are some advanced techniques for really pushing
student learning to new and higher levels of understand- ing.
They help take a boring, simple discussion and make it more
interesting, fun, interactive, and meaningful for students.
1. Increasingly challenging questions: Some instructors like
to scaffold the discussions in a way that also builds
knowledge from the general to the specific or from lower
to higher orders of learning.

163 | 6. Effective Online Discussions

◦ How this works:
▪ The instructor may start the students on a simple
discussion question that only requires lower levels
of thinking, such as knowledge (remembering) and
comprehension (understanding) (Bloom’s
Taxonomy).
▪ This starts the discussion on a lower level of
learning so that students begin to build their
knowledge and thoughts on the topic.
▪ The instructor posts and emails a summary of that
discussion.
▪ Then a second discussion question, due a

few
days later, may demand them to
integrate and apply the knowledge
from the first one in a more complex
way.

▪ The instructor posts and emails a summary of that
discussion.
▪ Then a third discussion question may advance this
learning strategy further, or require them to
summarize, integrate, and analyze what they have
learned even further.
2.

Role-play / Conference: Some instructors
assign roles or characters to students and
then give them scenarios to act out in the
online discussion forums. Note that these
are great alternative assessment methods
and help to really learn how much the
students know about a given topic. An
important tactic to keep in mind is in
conferences and role-play scenarios, it is best

6. Effective Online Discussions | 164

to survey the students prior to assigning
roles and to purposely put the students into
roles that are new or different than the
student’s own personal views or values.
Meaning, for example, make a democrat
play the role of a republican, or young person
play the role of an elderly resident. This way
the participants are forced to learn about
new views and opposite viewpoints than
they already had, thus expanding their
overall learning on the topic much more
than if they only debated, defended, or
played a role already in-line with their
current worldviews.
◦ Examples for Ideas:
▪

▪

Middle East Studies Course: The
instructor assigns students to be
different country leaders in the Middle
East, the students study the politics of
their assigned country, and then have
an online ’United Nations Peace
Conference’ in the discussion forums
concerning conflicts over land and
water rights.
Educational Psychology Course: The
instructor assigns students to be
different famous educa- tional
psychologists from different eras and/
or disciplines. Students study up on
the views and research of their

165 | 6. Effective Online Discussions

▪

3.

psychologist, and then in the forums
’acts out’ that person’s views on
specific questions or debates.
Environmental Science Course: The
instructor creates a role-play about use
of pesticides in a small community.
Students are given different roles, such
as the concerned house mom, the
business owner that sells the
chemicals, or the corporation
manager that exports the chemicals.
They then interact through questions
and concerns about the chemicals
and learn about different stakeholder
interests.

Discussions as a Data Source: Some
instructors use the discussion forums as a
research area for students. Students
generate resources and information, the
instructor can moderate it and comment on
it, and then students can use that
information to formulate essays, work, or
assignments.
◦ How this works:
▪ The instructor creates a discussion forum on a
given topic, and

assigns students to list
one fact and one web resource on the
topic.
▪ A few days later, the students might then

6. Effective Online Discussions | 166

participate in a second forum in which they
summarize the information generated in the first
one.
▪ The students might then be required to complete a
project, paper, or essay on the topic using at least
three of the things they learned about during the
data-driven discussions.
▪ This scaffolds their learning and also ensures they
use more reputable/approved sources of knowledge because

the instructor had a
chance to review them in advance.
4.

5.

Web 2.0: Many online Web 2.0 tools can be
used to create fun and interactive online
discussions. For example, Twitter is often
used as a live synchronous ’Tweet Chat’
where a question is asked and the
participants respond to the hashtag with
comments and thoughts.
Leadership Development.: An excellent
tactic is to make students a leader in the
discussions, which also attends to
encouraging students to be in charge of
their own learning. This tactic motivates
them to learn at least one topic fully, and by
teaching others they show their grasp of the
subject as well as learn leadership skills.
◦ How this works
▪ The instructor creates a schedule of important key
course topics. This could, for example, take the form
of one topic per week of the

167 | 6. Effective Online Discussions

▪ The students then sign up during the first week to
lead one weekly online
▪ They are given clear, concise, and precise guidelines
on how to prepare for their leadership week. These
directions should include a grading rubric outlining
how their work and participation will be assessed.
▪ A week prior to their leadership week, the instructor
connects with them either f2f or online to discuss
their The student is in charge of designing the
weekly discussion question, but the instructor
should review it prior to the student posting it.
▪ On the prescribed week, the student posts the
initial discussion question and is then the leader for
that topic, helping to guide and advance the
discussion. They are expected to show that they are
a leader/expert in that particular
▪ The instructor would moderate and interact as well,
but more in the backseat, leaving the student to
complete their leadership
▪ This is an alternative assessment measurement
method that can be easily and conveniently
assigned to any
6. Cross-pollination: Cross-pollination is a discussion sharing
tactic from The World Cafe . It is the idea that key concepts,
ideas, and conclusions from small groups can integrate into
others, all in the confines of more intimate discussions
without the overwhelming feeling coming from larger
group discussions. This concept is practiced by The World
Café at in-person sessions, however a variation on this
method can also be practiced in online discussions.
◦ How this works:

6. Effective Online Discussions | 168

▪ In a blended course the instructor may introduce
key discussion topics in the classroom, get the
discussion started, and then continue it in the
online
▪ In the learning management system (LMS) for the
course, the instructor then creates smaller groups
of 5-10 people and has them start on a specific
question related to the classroom discussions and
lectures. The instructor may even vary the question
slightly from group to group so that different
people obtain different conclusions and
▪ Then, after a given time, the instructor changes the
groups and puts students into new groups, and
continues the same discussion questions, but now
with slightly modified group
▪ The instructor may do this several times, and slowly
the ideas of everyone will cross-pollinate across the
groups, but done so through smaller learning
sessions easier for the students to
Summary
Online discussions can just be a place to answer some
questions and get some points or they can form a part of a
transformative learning process for students to enhance their
knowledge

of

the

topic

through

social

learning.

In

a

transformative experience one is forced to question his or her
thinking, to integrate new information, and to (hope- fully)
create new conclusions and thinking processes that include the
newly learned information. Through creating high quality
discussion questions that engage students, and asking them to
think beyond the normal boundaries they are used to, and then
moderating interactive and substantive online discussions, the

both inside and outside the face-to-face classroom.

INTRODUCTION
An important factor for high quality online learning is
equivalency. Equivalency means that the student will
have an equivalent learning experience online as they
would face-to-face (f2f). This does not mean the same
learning experience, it just means equivalent. If there
were important lectures in the f2f course on complex
topics, then the same learning opportunities should be
afforded the online student. The instructor can host a
synchronous

(real

time)

online

lecture

or

an

asynchronous (everyone on their own time) online
lecture. In a flipped learning (blended learning) situation,
the content in this chapter can be used to create high
quality lectures for students to view outside class, so that
class time can be focused on interactive group exercises.
Following we will cover some information, approaches,
and best practices related to all of these types of online
lectures.

CHAPTER OBJECTIVES
After reading and reviewing this chapter, you should be
able to:
1. Understand the difference between synchronous
and asynchronous online lectures.
2. Know when one type of online lecture is best
suited to the learning needs over another.
3. Be able to list the best practices and
considerations to keep in mind when designing
and hosting an online lecture.
4. Have an understanding of various tools to use for
different types of online lectures.

CHAPTER SECTIONS
1.

Section 1: Introduction
Online lecture, videos, or screencasts created by an instructor
can have a positive impact on students’ attitudes towards their
learning

experience.

Students

may

believe

that

they

7. Professional Online Lectures | 176

comprehend the content better due to hearing their instructor’s
voice. Students also believe they can work at their own pace
because of the ability replay the recorded video. Guerrero,
Baumgartel, and Zobott (2013) developed a study comparing
experiences of two sections of students within a transformation
of pedagogy setting that had similar traits to flipped learning.
Section 1 did not view screencasts and Section 2 did view
screencasts. Guerrero et al. state “Findings from instructor
insights reflect many

of the positive comments
made by students regarding the use of online
notes. Students in Section 2 seemed more
aware of the content being covered each day
and came to class prepared to engage with
group members on the content.” The
screencasts allowed students to view the lecture
outside of class. Students were able to gain an
initial understanding and went to class
prepared with questions along with applicable
knowledge for the face-to-face activities.
Guerrero et al. (2013) explained that students
from Section 1 received more “conventional”
education in which students took notes during
class with hands-on learning integrated
throughout
the
face-to-face
meetings.”
Students from Section 1 asked more definitionbased and procedural questions while students
from Section 2 asked more application-oriented
and conceptual questions. When students ask
more application-oriented questions this is
indicative of progressing towards higher order
thinking skills such as applying and analyzing.

177 | 7. Professional Online Lectures

Screencasts can be utilized to explain complex concepts or for
introductions. Screencasts can include a webcam that features
the instructor’s face along with audio commentary. Instructor
presence is integral for all learning environments, but the
challenges regarding interaction within online learning can be
met with screencasts. Jones, Kolloff, and Kolloff, (2006) state
“The introductory video can aid in communicating the
organization and expectations to the students […] Teachers
provide intellectual leadership and share their knowledge of the
subject matter with their students. The instructors must be able
to communicate the intellectual climate of the course and serve
as a model for their students” (pp. 1253-1254). Jones et al. (2006)
harp on the significance of instructor-created videos because of
the equivalency that can be fostered from the presence that is
exuded. Instructor made videos such as screencasts humanizes
the learning experience. Jones et al. (2006) state “Being able to
hear the instructor’s tone, humor, and see their body language
helps to make the information real for the students. The
participants report that they felt as if the introductory video gave
them a sense of “being in class” and provided them a familiar
feeling of “communicating face-to-face.”
Whether a course is blended or fully online, screencasted
videos

created

by

the

instructor

can

enhance

student

engagement because of the audio and visual components.
Hearing and seeing the instructor on a regular basis creates
a community of learners that connects students to instructors
while legitimizing an educational experience that may occur
globally or locally.

Asynchronous lectures are online lectures that are done on the
participant’s own time. The instructor and student do not need
to be present at the same time. This is a good type of online
lecture for fully asynchronous online courses in which students
are not required to attend any real-time sessions.
Effective Recorded Lectures for Online Courses
Recorded lectures for online courses provide the opportunity
for explicit explanations of a concept. Instructors can use
screencasting software or web conferencing software to record
microlectures. Brown, Luterbach, and Sugar (2009) state
“Wouter,

Paas,

&

Merrienboer

(2008)

observe

that

the

instructional methods of modeling and vicarious learning, in
which experts perform problem-solving tasks for learners while
explaining their actions are a good fit with teaching task
performance.”

Screencasting

offers

the

opportunity

for

instructors to record a video that captures the task performance
along with audio commentary explaining the process. Brown
et al. (2009) state “Screencasting technology fits well with this
instructional approach in that it presents digital video of the
expert’s actions for the learner to see while simultaneously
presenting the expert’s audio commentary on his/her actions.”
Screencasting also supports Mayer’s Cognitive Theory of
Multimedia Learning (CTML). The CTML states that students
learn better from words (spoken or typed) and graphics, rather
than just words alone (Mayer, 2005). Screencasting provides the
combination of graphics and words that encompasses the
practical vision of the CTML. The words can be in the form of
audio commentary or added as callouts to highlight key points
during the screencast.

7. Professional Online Lectures | 180

Recording a screencast entails structural elements and
instructional strategies that can impact student learning. Sugar,
Brown, and Luterbach (2010) state “Structural elements are
those that describe the format of a screencast in terms of
sectioning, screen recording, and general narrative elements.”
Sugar et al. (2010) identified three structural elements after
analyzing 37 screencasts. The structural elements include
bumpers, screen movement, and narration.
Bumpers are considered the introductory and concluding
statements for the screencast. They identify the beginning and
the ending of the screencast. Bumpers can also be utilized to
provide a brief introduction of the topic being presented in the
screencast.
Screen movement during a screencast can be considered
static or dynamic. Dynamic screen movement follows the cursor
and may zoom in to focus on particular images or text. This can
be helpful when identifying key points on a document with a
small font size. Static movement is when the screen does not
follow the cursor. This is evident when simply presenting the
content for a slideshow presentation.
Narration is the audio commentary for the screencast which
can be explicit or implicit. Explicit narration explains each step
such as “Click on the edit button in order to edit the site.” Implicit
narration could be “Edit the page then click save.” Notice the
implicit narration does not explain where the edit button is
located because of the implication that the student already
knows where the “edit” button is located. Explicit and implicit
narration depends on the background knowledge for the
students. A student that has limited experience with the topic
will require explicit instructions compared to someone with
significant experience may only need implicit instructions.
Best Practices for Creating Recorded Online Lectures

181 | 7. Professional Online Lectures

1. Scripts: Write a script of what you want to say, to make sure
the most important things are covered. This can then be
used as the transcript in the video to attend to ADA
compliance.
2.

3.

4.

5.

Storyboards: Design a story board, which is just
a plan of what will be said, shown, and
described. This helps guide the project to
make sure it covers the needed material.
Learning Nuggets: Break the topics down
into bite-sized ’learning nuggets’. Keep
narrated lecture videos to 15 minutes or less,
with 10 minutes being the optimal time.
People will not sit through longer video
lectures.
Colors: Think about text and content colors
to make sure they are easy on the eyes. For
example, light Orange text can be hard to
read.
Avoid Fluff: Keep the content tight and to
the point. People are busy and do not want
to waste their time. So stick to short learning videos
on key topics.

6. Images: Choose images that are specific to the topics and
that support the learning rather than are just there to grab
attention but do not add value to the lecture content.
7. Copyright: Make sure to get permission to use all images,
content, video, and music that are not your own to avoid
violating copyright laws. Give credit where credit is due, and
source all facts and information. Use Creative Commons
free images and music where possible (see the resource list
at the end of this Chapter).

7. Professional Online Lectures | 182

8. Content Sustainability: Making an online video lecture or
audio narrated PowerPoint lecture takes time. You want to
be sure you can reuse it repeatedly. Therefore, choose
sustainable topics and content that will not change. When
possible, choose the foundational concepts and knowledge
base that will be the same year after year and make the
online lectures about those concepts.
9. Quality Audio: Use a headset or microphone so that the
audio is clear and professional. Choose a room with little
background and ambient noise. High quality audio
recordings ensures the students can hear everything that is
said.
10. Shelf-Life: Avoid mentioning things like ’this week’s
assignment’ or mentioning current events or other things
that may change so as to push out the video’s expiration
date.

Best Practices Related to Visuals in Online Lectures
1. Less is More: Too much text and photos on the same slide
can overwhelm students and be hard to read. The less per
slide the better.
◦ The rule of thumb: 6-8 words per line, and 5-8 lines of
text for each slide maximum.
2. Font Matters: Choose fonts that are easy to read on
computer screens, such as Arial, Verdana and Tahoma.

7. Professional Online Lectures | 184

3. Font Size: Try to use font size of at least 24 point size if
possible, so that it is easier for participants to view and read.
4. Color: Choose colors that are easy to view and read. For
example, do not use dark red on a black background, as this
strains the eyes to view.
5. Landscape: using the landscape layout fits better on
participant computer screens.

Section 3: Synchronous Online Lectures
In some virtual classes students can benefit greatly from
synchronous chat sessions, office hours, or lectures with the
instructor and other students. In some courses the instructor
has online synchronous office hours in which students can
contact them to ask specific questions real-time about content
they are having trouble with. In other cases, the instructor can
host online lectures covering the same material they would in a
face-to-face (f2f) classroom. Some instructors host online group
work and activities for students. There are many ways that a
synchronous lecture session can be utilized to give online
students the equivalent learning opportunities they would have
in a f2f setting.

Best Practices for Hosting Online Synchronous Lectures
1. Prepare: Have the slides ready to share, have a list of the
video links to show, and have handouts ready to email out.
This way lecture time is not wasted searching about in
Google trying to find that link for sharing.
2. Check for Attention: Make sure people are still with you. In
an online lecture it can be easy to lose people and not know
it. About every 10 minutes stop the lecture and do
something to engage the students, such as complete a poll
or ask a question. Alternatively ask them to type something
in the chat box, or ’raise their hand’ to contribute. This helps
to keep their attention on the lecture.
3. Check for Understanding: About every 10 minutes, ask
people if they understand the concepts so far by either
clicking on the green check mark (as found in some online
webinar and lecture tools), or putting a smiley face in the
chat box, or some other tactic to check that they are still
with you.
4. Group Work: Many webinar and online lecture tools have
what is called ’breakout rooms’. These are sub- rooms in the
online lecture room to funnel students into for smaller
group work. Instructors can lecture for 15 minutes, and then
put students into small-group breakout rooms for a
discussion amongst themselves and then they come back
to the main room to present their ideas to everyone. Having
students take on some presenting and discussion
management roles can increase their engagement with
the online lecture process and content.
5. Whiteboard: Write clearly and largely on the whiteboard, to
make sure that all symbols are clear to the students.
6. Encourage Interactivity: Where possible encourage the
students to interact with the lecture content, to ask

7. Professional Online Lectures | 186

questions, or to complete mini-exercises. This keeps them
engaged.
7. Outlining Visuals: If you will be pointing to key features on
a graphic then use the annotation tools found in most
webinar and online lecture software tools to make marks,
circle things, or point to specific areas. This way the
instructor is sure participants know what specifically they
are talking about.
Visuals Best Practices: See the section above and the best
practices related to visuals.

The Fizz Method for Flipped Learning

A YouTube element has been excluded from this version of

Flipped learning is, essentially, blended learning. It is a course
that utilizes both in-class time and online time for student
learning. The focus of a flipped learning approach is to take
the lectures out of the classroom time and put them online for
students to view on their own time prior to class, and then using
the in-class time for in-person activities that better utilize the
face-to-face (f2f) time than lectures would.
Some of the benefits and reasons to move to a flippedlearning environment are:
1. Limited class time: There is only so much f2f time with
students. Why waste it droning on about lecture topics they
could easily read or view prior to coming to class? Instead

7. Professional Online Lectures | 188

put the lectures online, and use limited class time for doing
interactive student group work on the lecture materials.

Checking for Understanding: This one is
very important! If you lecture for an hour,
students take notes, and then leave. But how
do you know they actually correctly
understood the content? How do you catch
misconceptions? If you put the lecture
online for the students to view prior to class,
then you may use limited class time to check
for student understanding and application
of the learning content, which in turn takes
the student to a higher order of Bloom’s
Taxonomy.
Teach Self-Efficacy: In the modern world we
must become responsible for our own
progress and success. We have to learn to
organize our time, and take control of our
learning. A flipped learning environment
teaches students to plan ahead and review
content prior to coming to class. Though we
do suggest a quiz at the start of class to be
sure they actually viewed the lectures before
coming.
Better Learning Design: Split the class up
into learning that works well online, and that
which is best suited to the in-person
environment, so that students are getting
the best use of learning time with the
instructor.

Following are some tips and tools to support a flipped learning
or even fully online classroom environment:
1. Online Presentations as Lectures: You can create online
lectures using a presentation you normally use in a f2f
course. However, note that taking a PowerPoint
presentation and throwing it into an online course with out
notes or audio to go with it is akin to standing in the back of
a classroom and flipping through the slides without saying
anything to the students. Throwing a PowerPoint into an
online course is not providing a suitable online lecture
material to students that is the equivalent to what they
would get in a f2f course. Remember, it is about
equivalency. Here are some online presentation tools you
could use, and then screencast yourself speaking about
each slide or image in them, and then provide that
screencast of your audio lecture on the presentation as an
online lecture for students.
◦ Prezi (Presentations that are more dynamic than
PowerPoint): https://prezi.com/
◦ Sway (Interactive reports and presentations):

https://sway.com/
◦ Glogster (Multimedia Posters):

http://www.glogster.com/#one
2.

Screencasted Lectures: There is now easy
access to many different types of
screencasting tools online. This makes it
easy to video record a lecture or screencast a
tutorial online and then load those in the
online portion of the course for students to
access on their own time. Then classroom
7. Professional Online Lectures | 190

time can used instead for checking
understanding on those concepts.
◦ Two good possible tools to try:
▪ Screen-casto-matic: http://wscreencasto-matic.com/
▪ Knovio (the free version): http://wknovio.com/
▪ PowToon: http://wpowtoon.com/
▪ Prezi : https://prezcom (Use screen-casto-matic to
record the audio of a Prezi or PowerPoint)
▪ Sway: https://sway.com/
3. Digital Learning Objects (DLOs) as Lectures: Online
lectures can take many forms. They do not need to be
videos or screencasts. There are tons of online Web 2.0 tools
that can be used to create interactive learning resources,
lectures, and study materials online. In using them to create
the online learning and lecture content, the instructor can
then use the limited in-class time for learning experiences
better suited to in-person connections.
◦ Here are a few tools to use for this, though there are
many more online:
▪ – Quizlet (quizzes, games, flashcards, and more):
https://quizcom/
▪ – VoiceThread (video discussions):
http://voicethrecom/
▪ – ThingLink (interactive learning images):
https://thinglink.com/
▪ – Popplet (mind mapping): http://popplcom/

CHAPTER TASK
Chapter Task
Choose a tool, and create an online digital learning
object, screencast, video lecture, or other lecture learning
object. This could be as simple as setting up a video
camera in front of a whiteboard, and walking through
a lecture, or as simple as screencasting yourself talking
about each slide of a PowerPoint or Prezi presentation.
Complete the following steps:
1. Decide on the topic and subject of the video. It
should align with a learning unit in a course you
will teach.
2. Create even a simple and short story board that
outlines what the video, screencast, or digital
learning object will include.
3. Write up the script for any audio you will lecture. If
you will be creating a screencast of a PowerPoint
or Prezi presentation, then write up the notes for
each slide.
