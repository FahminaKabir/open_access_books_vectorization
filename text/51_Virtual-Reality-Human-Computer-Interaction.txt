In recent years, virtual reality technology has become a very popular technology,
which embodies the newest research achievements in the fields of computer
technology, computer graphics, sensor technology, ergonomics, human-machine
interaction theory. More and more people devote into this field and commit
themselves to its research, development and application. Virtual reality technology has
become one of the means for human to explore the world. What is brought to us by
virtual reality? Firstly, it has changed our ideas. Now, the person, instead of computer,
is the main body of information technology. Secondly, it has improved the humanmachine interactive manner. Now, the natural interactive manner by hand and sound
replaces the passive mode in the past. Thirdly, it has changed the manner of life and
entertainment. In a word, virtual reality technology is an important technology to be
paid attention, which will bring huge impact to our life and work.
The book aims to provide a broader perspective of virtual reality on development and
application. In this book, we mainly introduce development trend and application of
virtual reality. The book includes four parts, the first part is named as “virtual reality
visualization and vision”, which includes new developments in virtual reality
visualization of 3D scenarios, virtual reality and vision, high fidelity immersive virtual
reality included tracking, rendering and display subsystems. And the second part
named as “virtual reality in robot technology” brings forth applications of virtual
reality in remote rehabilitation robot-based rehabilitation evaluation method and
multi-legged robot adaptive walking in unstructured terrains. And the third part
named as “industrial and construction applications” is about the product design, space
industry, building information modeling, construction and maintenance by virtual
reality, and so on. And the last part, which is named as “culture and life of human”, is
about the culture life and multimedia technology.
At present, the virtual reality not only is used to improve the existing information
system in human-computer interaction means, but also has impact on information
organization and management, and even changes design principle of information
systems, which will make it adapt to application requirements. However, our reviews
regarding virtual reality is only limited to the robot, construction and industry, and
culture life and multimedia technology. In fact, virtual reality only succeeds in
penetrating total information systems by breaking through the limitation, which will

get more healthy and rapid development. Although three-dimensional stereoscopic
display device, head tracking device and rendering techniques based on image have
been applied, many hardware and software problems need to be solved. Firstly,
improve the hardware support by reducing the price of graphics accelerator and
decreasing the dependence to three-dimensional stereoscopic display device. It is
impossible for every information system to use the expensive graphics workstation
and for everyone using the computer to wear the display device. Secondly, improve
software development environment support. For example, whether it is possible that
virtual reality display system can be generated only from the image directly, and no
requiring manual rendering of three-dimensional geometric models, or the virtual
reality environment can be rendered real time only by the software accelerator, that
will be a problem. Therefore, it is necessary for us to summarize the available
technology and application, and discuss the future development trend of virtual
reality. Despite new advances in the field of virtual reality technology cannot be
covered exhaustively in this volume, we hope this book will help readers to
understand how to create and apply the virtual reality system.

1. Introduction
Virtual Reality (VR) is successfully employed for a real huge variety of applications because
it can furnish major improvement and can be really effective in fields such as engineering,
medicine, design, architecture and construction, education and training, arts, entertainment,
business, communication, marketing, military, exploration, and so on. Therefore great
efforts have been paid over time to the development of more and more realistic and
sophisticated VR scenarios and representations.
Since VR is basically a three-dimensional representation of a not real environment, mainly
due to computer-generated simulation, Computation and Visualization are the key
technologies to pay attention to. But while the Computational Technology experienced an
exponential growth during the last decades (the number of transistors on an integrated
circuit doubles approximately every 18 months according to the Moore’s law), the
Technology devoted to Visualization did not catch up with its counterpart till now. This can
represent a limit or, even, a problem, due to the fact that human beings largely rely on
Visualization, and the human reactions can be more appropriate in front of spatial, threedimensional images, rather than to the current mainly adopted two-dimensional
Visualization of scenarios, text and sketches. The current adoption of flat panel monitors
which represent only the “illusion” of the depth, does not completely satisfy the
requirement of an “immersive” experience.
In VR, a Visualization in three dimensions becomes more and more mandatory, since it
allows more easily the humans to see patterns, relationships, trends, .. otherwise difficult to
gather.
This chapter describes the actual requirements for 3D Visualization in VR, the current state
and the near future of the new trends. The final goal is to furnish to the reader a complete

4 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

panorama of the state of the art and of the realizations under development in the research
laboratories for the future possibilities.
To this aim we report the most significant commercial products and the most relevant
improvements obtained with research prototypes for 3D Visualization in VR. In addition an
interesting patented technology is described for which the screen is not made by a solid
material as it usually occurs, so that the viewer can even walk-through the visualized
scenario.

2. Requirements
The requirement for 3D Visualization in VR seems that can be now partially or, in some
way, completely satisfied thanks to new possibilities offered by the latest technologies.
We are not thinking to the “standard” 3D representation furnished by flat monitors, but
real new 3D Visualization which can occur in a three-dimensional room environment,
furnished by dedicated equipment, which allows to visualize any scenario from any
perspective.
That’s the way to realize the longed “real” immersive experience, even going beyond mere
images visualized on a screen, toward ones that we can interact with and walk-through or
navigate-through (the so called Princess Leia effect from the Star Wars movie) because no solid
support for projection is necessary.
Today, the term VR is also used for applications that are not properly “immersive”, since the
boundaries of VR definition are within a certain blur degree. So, VR is named also for
variations which include mouse-controlled navigation “through” a graphics monitor, maybe
with a stereo viewing via active glasses. Apple’s QuickTime VR, for example, uses
photographs for the modelling of three-dimensional worlds and provides pseudo lookaround and walk-trough capabilities on a graphic monitor. But this cannot be considered as
a real VR experience.
So here we present and discuss new technologies and new trends in Virtual Reality
Visualization of 3D Scenarios, also reporting our personal research and applications,
especially devoted to new holographic systems of projection.
This chapter covers the aspects related to the Visualization tools for VR, talking of their
requirements, history, evolution, and latest developments. In particular an novel authors’
patented technology is presented.
We can expect from the future weaker and weaker boundaries between Real Environment
(RE) and Virtual Environment (VE). Currently RE and VE are recognized to be the extremes
of a continuum line where Augmented Reality (AR) and Augmented Virtuality (AV) lie too,
according to the proposition of Milgram & Kishino (1994, see Figure 1). But we believe, in a
near future, this line will become a circle, with the two extremes to be overlapped in a single
point.

New Trends in Virtual Reality Visualization of 3D Scenarios 5

Figure 1. Virtuality-Reality Continuum

It means it will occur a difficulty or, even, impossibility for human senses to distinguish
between Reality and Virtuality, and that’s the real challenging goal. But, to this aim, the
Visualization Technology needs to realize a burst of speed.
In the following we’ll treat the new technology regarding Immersive Video, Nomatic Video,
Head Mounted Displays, 3D AutoStereoscopy, Transparent Displays and HoloMachines.
We will focus our attention in particular on 3D AutoStereoscopy and HoloMachines, since
we have been spending efforts and gained experiences on these two technologies during
latest years.

3. Actual state of new trends
Among all the commonly adopted methods to visualize a virtual or real scenario, there are
some technologies worth to be mentioned as the more interesting ones, representing the
actual state of new trends. So, in the following the Immersive Video, the Nomadic Video
and the Head Mounted Displays are reported.

3.1. Immersive video
Immersive Video (IV) technology stands for 360° video applications, such as the Full-Views
Full-Circle 360° camera. IV can be projected as multiple images on scalable large screens,
such as an immersive dome, and can be streamed so that viewers can look around as if they
were at a real scenario.
Different IV technologies have been developed. Their common denominator consists in the
possibility to “navigate” within a video, exploring the scenario in all directions while the
video is running. The scenario in generally available for a 360° view, but it is visible in a
reduced portion at time, changeable according to the user’s preference. Currently a few
Company are devoted to IV technology, but their number is expected to growth
exponentially. Let’s consider here the major examples.
A first example comes from the Immersive Media® Company (www.immersivemedia.com)
which is a provider of 360° spherical full motion interactive videos. The Company
developed the Telemmersion® system, which is an integrated platform for capturing,
storing, editing, managing spherical 3D or interactive video. A complete process of
developing and building “spherical cameras”, through the manipulation and storage of data
to create the interactive imagery, to the delivery of the imagery and creating the immersive
experience on a user's computer. Video shootings are realized by means of a spherical

6 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

device in which different cameras are embedded in a way that images can be captured all
around, with the only exception of the real base of the device. A limit comes from the not so
performing Shockwave video format, but a “migration” to the Flash format can allow a
partial improving of the performance.
The Global Vision Communication (www.globalvision.ch) furnishes technology regarding
Immersive Video Pictures and Tours. In particular, their 360° interactive virtual tours can be
easily integrated on existing website, or be a website themselves. Each individual panorama
in a virtual tour is 360° HD-quality, clickable and draggable, linked to the others through
hotspots for navigation and displayed on a customized map, featuring a directional radar.
The virtual tour can be enhanced with sounds, pictures, texts, and hotpots.
The VirtualVisit Company (www.virtualvisit.tv) offers services related to 360° imagery too.
Their services range from creation of 360° photography of facilities and programming high
quality flash-, java- and iPhone/iPad compliant virtual visits.
The YellowBird® Company provides another example of end-to-end 360° video solutions
(www.yellowbirdsdonthavewingsbuttheyflytomakeyouexperiencea3dreality.com).
They
shoot, edit, develop and distribute interactive 360° concepts with some of the most
progressive agencies, broadcasters and brands around the world.
Another example we can mention is the Panoscope 360° (www.panoscope360.com), which
consists of a single channel immersive display composed of a large inverted dome, a
hemispheric lens and projector, a computer and a surround sound system. From within,
visitors can navigate in real-time in a virtual 3D world using a handheld 3-axis
pointer/selector. The Panoscope 360° is the basis of the Panoscope LAN consisting of
networked immersive displays where visitors can play with each other in a shared
environment. Catch&Run, the featured program, recreates a children's game where the fox
can eat the chicken, the chicken can beat the snake and the snake can kill the fox. The terrain,
an array of vertically moving rooftops, can be altered in real time, at random, or by a
waiting audience trying to “help” players inside.
In the IV frame is concerned the European FP7 research project “3DPresence”
(www.3dpresence.eu), which aims the realization of effective communication and
collaboration with geographically dispersed co-workers, partners, and customers, who
requires a natural, comfortable, and easy-to-use experience that utilizes the full bandwidth
of non-verbal communication. The project intends to go beyond the current state of the art
by emphasizing the transmission, efficient coding and accurate representation of physical
presence cues such as multiple user (auto)stereopsis, multi-party eye contact and multiparty gesture-based interaction. With this goal in mind, the 3DPresence project intends to
implement a multi-party, high-end 3D videoconferencing concept that will tackle the
problem of transmitting the feeling of physical presence in real-time to multiple remote
locations in a transparent and natural way.
Interesting immersive VR solutions come from CLARTE (www.clarte.asso.fr), which is a
research centre located in Laval, France. In November 2010, CLARTE introduced the new

New Trends in Virtual Reality Visualization of 3D Scenarios 7

SAS 3+, a new Barco I-Space immersive virtual reality cube for its research projects. The ISpace is a multi-walled stereoscopic environment (made of three screens, each of 3x4
meters) that surrounds the user completely with virtual imagery. The SAS 3+ installation at
CLARTE is powered with eight Barco Galaxy NW-12 full HD projectors and designed with
three giant 4 by 3 meter glass screens.
The UC San Diego division of the California Institute for Telecommunications and
Information Technology (Calit2, www.calit2.net), developed the StarCAVE system. It is a
five-sided VR room where scientific models and animations are projected in stereo on 360degree screens surrounding the viewer, and onto the floor as well. The room operates at a
combined resolution of over 68 million pixels - 34 million per eye - distributed over 15
rear-projected walls and two floor screens. Each side of the pentagon-shaped room has
three stacked screens, with the bottom and top screens titled inward by 15 degrees to
increase the feeling of immersion. At less than $1 million, the StarCAVE immersive
environment cost approximately the same as earlier VR systems, while offering higher
resolution and contrast.
The IV technology is still quite “immature” and expensive but, despite all, it appears to be
really promising, thus we can image the future with the current quality problems
outmoded, and it will be possible to “navigate into” a movie in real effective ways, looking
at the scene from a whatever point of view, even without pay attention to the leading actor
but to a secondary scenario.
The IV technology experienced an improvement in performances thanks to new software
plug-ins, the most interesting ones coming from Adobe and Apple.
In particular, the Flash® Immersive Video format, developed by Adobe, is especially
adopted as a web solution to “navigate” in a street view, and keeping the mouse’s cursor in
the direction towards it is intended to go, the scene will change accordingly (see
www.mykugi.com as an example).
Also Apple Inc. is interested in the IV technology, and developed the QuickTime Virtual
Reality (QuickTime VR or QTVR) as a type of image file format. QTVR can be adopted for
the creation and viewing of photographically-captured panoramas and the exploration of
objects through images taken at multiple viewing angles. It functions as a plugin for the
standalone QuickTime Player, as well as working as a plugin for the QuickTime Web
browser plugin.

3.2. Nomadic video
A different way of visualization comes from the Nomadic Video (NV) approach realized by
researchers of the Technische Universität Darmstadt (Huber et al., 2011). The display surface
is not required to be dedicated and/or static, and the video content can change upon the
surrounding context decided by the user. Everyday objects sojourning in a beam are turned
into dedicated projection surfaces and tangible interaction devices. The approach is based

8 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

on a pico-projector and on a Kinect sensor (by Microsoft Corporation). Pico-projectors and
Kinect capabilities (motion tracking and depth sensing), might be able to turn any old
surface into an interactive display (with varying results of course). Everyday objects, of the
real scene surrounding the user, become a sort of “remote control”, in a sense that the picoprojector plays different scenes according to their arrangement in the space. Makeshift
display surfaces - a piece of paper or a book, for example - can be manipulated within a
limited 3D space and the projected image will reorient itself, even rotating when the paper is
rotated. The level of detail displayed by the projector can also be altered dynamically, with
respect to the amount of display surface available. The NV system also allows everyday
objects to function as a remote control since, for instance, a presentation can be controlled by
manipulating an object within the camera’s field of vision.
Another example of NV comes from the “R-Screen” 3D viewer, that was premiered at the
Laval Virtual Exhibition, which is a VR 3-D devices and interactive technology conference
that took place in Laval, France, on April 2009. The device is the result of collaboration
between Renault’s Information Technology Department and Clarté, the Laval Center for
Virtual Reality Studies – which designed and built it. The 3D viewer enables users to walk
around a virtual vehicle, as they would with a real vehicle. The “R-Screen” is a motorized
screen pivoting 360° and measuring 2.50 m wide and 1.80 m high. It follows the movements
of the user in such a way as to always be directly in front of the user. The system adopts
several 3DVIA Virtools modules, including their VR pack. The concept was developed by
Clarté and patented by Renault. A virtual, scale-one 3D image is displayed on screen. A
computer updates the image according to the movements of R-Screen, enabling users to
view the virtual vehicle from all angles.

3.3. Head Mounted Displays
The Head Mounted Display (HMD), also known as Helmet Mounted Display, is a visor that
can be worn on the user’s head, provided with one or two optical displays in
correspondence of one or two eyes. The possibility to adopt one display for one eye, allows
different images for the left and right eyes, so to obtain the perception of depth.
The HMD is considered to be the centerpiece for early visions of VR. In fact, the first VR
system also highlighted the first HMD.
In 1968, computer science visionary Ivan Sutherland developed a HMD system that
immersed the user in a virtual computer graphics world. The system was incredibly
forward-thinking and involved binocular rendering, head-tracking (the scene being
rendered was driven by changes in the users head position) and a vector rendering system.
The entire system was so cumbersome that the HMD was mounted directly to the ceiling
and hung over the user in a somewhat intimidating manner.
One of the first commercial HMD can be considered the Nintendo's Virtual Boy, a 3-D
wearable gaming machine that went on sale in the 1990s, but bombed, partly because of the
bulky headgear required as well as the image being all red.

New Trends in Virtual Reality Visualization of 3D Scenarios 9

A recent product was developed by technology giant Sony, that has unveiled a HMD named
Personal 3D Viewer HMZ-T1, that takes the wearer into a 3D cinema of videos, music and
games. The Sony’s personal 3D viewer is being targeted at people who prefer solitary
entertainment rather than sitting in front of a television with family or friends. Resembling a
futuristic visor, the $800 device is worn like a pair of chunky goggles and earphones in one.
It is equipped with two 0.7 inch high definition organic light emitting diode (OLED) panels
and 5.1 channel dynamic audio headphone. The gadget enables the wearer to experience
cinema-like viewing, equivalent to watching a 750 inch screen from 20 metres away.
But probably the more interesting HMD was developed by Sensics Inc. (www.sensics.com)
with the SmartGoggles™ technology, based on which was realized the “Natalia”, a highlyimmersive 3D SmartGoggle available as a development platform to content and device
partners, with the expectation that it will be available to consumers later in 2012. Natalia has
got on-board: 1.2 GHz dual-core processor with graphics and 3D co-processor running
Android 4.0; true 3D display 360 degree use; embedded head tracker for head angular
position and linear acceleration; dual SXGA (1280×1024) OLED displays, supporting 720p,
64 degree field of view for excellent immersion; embedded stereo audio and microphone;
WiFi and Bluetooth services.
Generally speaking, the HMDs have the advantages to be lightweight, compact, easy to
program, 360° tracking, generally cheap (even if, for some particular cases, the cost can be as
high as 40,000$), and let’s experience a cinema-like viewing.
But, important drawbacks are a low resolution (the effective pixel size for the user can be
quite large), low field of vision (Arthur, 2000), aliasing problems can become apparent, the
high latency between the time a user repositions his/her head and the time it takes to render
an update to the scene (Mine, 1993), effect of level-of-detail degradation in the periphery
(Watson et al., 1997), the fact that the HMDs must be donned and adjusted, and that they are
not recommended for people 15 years old and younger because some experts believe overly
stimulating imagery is not good for teenagers whose brains are still developing.
Actually we can affirm that the HMDs did not take-off till now. In fact, outside of niche
military training applications and some limited exposure in entertainment, the HMDs are
very rarely seen. This is despite interesting commercial development from some very
important players like Sony who developed the LCD-based Glasstron in 1997, and the
HMZ-T1 during the current year.

4. Near future of new trends
4.1. AutoStereoscopy
Latest trend in visualization aims to furnish the “illusion of depth” in an image by
presenting two offset images separately to the left and right eye of the viewer. The brain is
then able to combine these two-dimensional images and a resulting perception of 3-D depth
is realized. This technique is known as Stereoscopy or 3D imaging.

10 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

Three are the main techniques developed to present two offset images one for eye: the user
wear eyeglasses to combine the two separate images from two offset sources; the user wear
eyeglasses to filter for each eye the two offset images from a single source; the user’s eyes
receive a directionally splitted image from the same source. The latter technique is known as
AutoStereoscopy (AS) and does not require any eyeglasses.
An improvement of the AS refers of AutoMultiscopic (AM) displays which can provide
more than just two views of the same image. So, the AS realized by AM displays is
undoubtedly one of the really new frontier that must be consider for the near future to
realize the “illusion of depth”, since leaves aside the uncomfortable eyeglasses and realizes a
multi-point view of the same image. In such a way the user has not only the “illusion of
depth” but the “illusion to turn around” the visualized object just moving his/her head
position with respect to the source.

4.2. Alioscopy
The “feeling as sensation of present” in a VR scene is a fundamental requirement, and the
AM displays go in that direction. So, we want here to present the “Alioscopy” display that is
one realization of such technology, with which our research group is involved in.
The movements, the virtual interaction with the represented environment and the use of
some interfaces are possible only if the user “feels the space” and understands where all the
virtual objects are located. But the level of immersion in the AR highly depends on the
display devices used. Strictly regarding the criteria of the representation, a correct approach
for the visualization of a scenario helps to understand the dynamic behaviour of a system
better as well as faster. But an interesting boost in the representation comes, in the latest
years, from a 3D approach which offers help in communication and discussion of decisions
with non-experts too. The creation of a 3D visual information or the representation of a
“illusion” of depth in a real or virtual image is generally referred as Stereoscopy. A strategy
to obtain this is through eyeglasses, worn by the viewer, utilized to combine separate
images from two offset sources or to filter offset images from a single source separated to
each eye. But the eyeglass based systems can suffer from uncomfortable eyewear, control
wires, cross-talk levels up to 10% (Bos, 1993), image flickering and reduction in brightness.
On the other end, AutoStereoscopy (AS) is the technique to display stereoscopic images
without the use of special headgear or glasses on the part of the viewer. Viewing freedom
can be enhanced: presenting a large number of views so that, as the observer moves, a
different pair of the views is seen for each new position; tracking the position of the observer
and update the display optics so that the observer is maintained in the AutoStereoscopic
condition (Woodgate et al., 1998). Since AutoStereoscopic displays require no viewing aids
seem to be a more natural long-term route to 3D display products, even if can present loss of
image (typically caused by inadequate display bandwidth) and cross-talk between image
channels (due to scattering and aberrations of the optical system). In any case we want here
to focus on the AS for realizing what we believe to be, at the moment, one of the more
interesting 3D representations for VR.

New Trends in Virtual Reality Visualization of 3D Scenarios 11

Current AutoStereoscopic systems are based on different technologies which include
lenticular lens (array of magnifying lenses), parallax barrier (alternating points of view),
volumetric (via the emission, scattering, or relaying of illumination from well-defined
regions in space), electro-holographic (a holographic optical images are projected for the
two eyes and reflected by a convex mirror on a screen), and light field displays (consisting
of two layered parallax barriers). Figure 2 schematizes current AutoStereoscopic
Techniques. See Pastoor and Wöpking (1997), Börner (1999) and Okoshi (1976) for more
detailed descriptions.

Figure 2. Schematization of current AutoStereoscopic techniques

Our efforts are currently devoted respect to four main aspects:





user comfort,
amount of data to process,
image realism,
deal with real objects as well with as graphical models.

In such a view, our collaboration involves the Alioscopy company (www.alioscopy.com)
regarding a patented 3D AS visualization system which, even if does not completely satisfy
all the requirements of a “full immersive” VR, remains one of the most affordable system, in
terms of cost and quality results.

12 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

The 3D monitor, offered by the Company, is based on the standard Full HD LCD and its
feature back 8 points of view is called MultiScope. Each pixel of the LCD panel combines the
three fundamental sub-pixel colour (red, green and blue) and the arrays of lenticular lenses
(then Lenticular Imaging, see the schematization of Figure 2) cast different images onto each
eye, since magnify different point of view for each eye viewed from slightly different angles
(see Figure 3).

This results in a state of the art visual stereo effect, rendered with typical 3D software such as
3D Studio Max (www.autodesk.it/3dsmax), Maya (www.autodesk.com/maya), Lightwave
(www.newtek.com/lightwave.html), and XSI (www.softimage.com). The display uses 8
interleaved images to produce the AutoStereoscopic 3D effect with multiple viewpoints.
We realized 3D images and videos, adopting two different approaches for graphical and
real model. The graphical model is easily managed thanks to the 3D Studio Max Alioscopy
plug-in, which is not usable for real images, and for which it is necessary a set of multicameras to recover 8 view-points (see Figure 4).

different distances

New Trends in Virtual Reality Visualization of 3D Scenarios 13

The virtual images or real captured ones are then mixed, by means of OpenGL tools, in
groups of eight to realize AutoStereoscopic 3D scenes. Particular attention must be paid in
positioning the cameras to obtain a correct motion capture of a model or a real image, in
particular the cameras must have the same distance apart (6.5 cm is the optimal distance)
and each camera must “see” the same scene but from a different angle (see Figure 5).

layout we adopted for them

Figure 6 reports screen captures of three realized videos. The images show blur effects when
reproduced in a non AutoStereoscopic way (as it happens in the Figure). In particular, the
image in Figure 6c reproduces eight numbers (from 1 to 8), and the user see, on the AS
monitor, just one number at time depending on his/her angular position with respect the
monitor itself.

The great advantage of the AS systems consists of an “immersive” experience of the user,
with unmatched 3D pop-out and depth effects on video screens, and this is obtained
without the uncomfortable eyewear of any kind of glasses. On the other end, an important
amount of data must be processed for every frame since it is formed by eight images at the

14 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

same time. Current personal computers are, in any case, capable to deal with these amount
of data since the powerful graphic cards available today.

4.3. Transparent displays
Cutting-edge display technologies have brought us many new devices including thin and
high-quality TVs, touchscreen phones and sleek tablet PCs. Now the latest innovation from
the field is set to the transparent technology, which produces displays with a high
transparency rate and without a full-size backlight unit. The panel therefore works as a
device’s screen and a see-through glass at the same time.
The transparent displays (TDs) have a wide range of use in all industry areas as an efficient
tool for delivering information and communication. These panels can be applied to show
windows, outdoor billboards, and in showcase events. Corporations and schools can also
adopt the panel as an interactive communication device, which enables information to be
displayed more effectively.
From research groups of Microsoft Applied Science and MIT Media Lab has been developed
a unique sensor OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) transparent technology. It is the base
of a “see-through screen”.

Figure 7. A Kinect-driven prototype desktop environment by the Microsoft Applied Sciences Group
allows users to manipulate 3D objects by hand behind a transparent OLED display
(www.microsoft.com/appliedsciences)

Again from Microsoft Research comes the so called “HoloDesk”, for direct 3D interactions
with a Situated See-Through Display. It is basically an interactive system which combines an
optical see-through display and a Kinect camera to create the illusion for the user to interact
with virtual objects (Figure 7). The see-through display consists of a half silvered mirror on
top of which a 3D scene is rendered and spatially aligned with the real-world for the user
who, literally, gets his/her hands into the virtual display.
A TD is furnished by Kent Optronics Inc. (www.kentoptronics.com). The display contains a
thin layer of bi-stable PSCT liquid crystal material sandwiched between either plastic or
glass substrates. Made into a large size of meters square, the display exhibits three interswitchable optical states of (a) uniform transparent as a conventional glass window, (b)
uniform frosted for privacy protection, and (c) information display.

New Trends in Virtual Reality Visualization of 3D Scenarios 15

A transparent LCD Panel comes also from Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd (www.samsung.com)
with the world’s first mass produced transparent display product, designed to be used as a PC
monitor or a TV. This panel boasts a high transmittance rate (over 20% for the black-and-white
type and over 15% for the colour type), which enables a person to look right through the panel
like glass. The panel utilizes ambient light such as sunlight, which consequently reduces the
power required since there is no backlight, and it consumes 90% less electricity compared with
a conventional LCD panel using back light unit.
The TDs are not so far-away to be used in every-day life.
Samsung announced to start mass production during the current year of a 46-inch
transparent LCD panel, that features a contrast ratio of 4,500:1 with HD (1,366x768)
resolution and 70% colour gamut. The company has been producing smaller 22-inch
transparent screens since March 2011, but the recently-developed 46-inch model has much
greater potential and wider usage.
LG Company (www.lg.com) is involved in the TD technology too. A 47 inch Transparent LCD
display with multi-touch functionality has been realized with a full HD 1920×1080 pixel
resolution. The Panel is an IPS technology with 10.000 K colour temperature. LG developed also
a WVGA Active Transparent Bistable LCD which could be for future Head-up display (HUD).

4.4. HoloMachine
All the previously reported display systems are based on a solid support, generally a
monitor or a projection surface. But a great improvement comes if the reproduction of a
scene is realized with a non-solid support.
The holographic technique satisfies in principle this requirement. With the term of
“holography” is generally referred the technique by which it is recorded the light scattered
from an object and later reconstructed by a beam which restores the high-grade volumetric
image of that object (see Figure 8). The result is that the image appears three-dimensional
and changes as the position and orientation of the viewer changes in exactly the same way
as if the object were really present. Unfortunately, the holography claims a technology that
is still too complex and too expensive to find common applications in everyday life, so new
possibilities are currently under investigation.

Figure 8. An example of hologram

16 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

A first new type of approach comes from the public lightshow displays, in which a beam of
laser light is shone through a diffuse cloud of fog, but the results are not as good as a the
reconstruction of a real scenario pretends, and the technique is limited to realize just written
words or poor drawings.
The real new possibility is due to a new machine which realizes a screen made out of
nothing but micro-particles of water. The HoloMachine (see Figure 9), that’s the name of the
innovation, is a patented technology (patent no. PCT/IB2011/000645), deposited by the
authors of this paper, consisting of a holographic projection system which does not utilize
solid screen but an air laminar flow, aerial, inconsistent, somewhat everybody can go
through. The machine “creates” the illusion that the images are floating in mid-air.

Figure 9. The compact hardware of the HoloMachine. The woman indicates the slots from which the
micro-particles of water are ejected. Courtesy of PFM Multimedia (Milan, Italy)

The heart of the system is an ultrasonic generator of “atomized” water, so that tiny droplets
(few microns in diameter) are convoyed, sandwiched and mixed in a laminar airflow that
works as a screen on which you can project (through a dedicated commercially available
video-projector) images realized with a 3D-technology, Chroma-Key based. The subsequent
holographic images you can obtain on this air laminar flow result suggestively aerial,
floating in the air, naturally going-through by any spectator, disappearing and reappearing
after have been passed through.

(b)

Figure 10. (a) An image appears to be “suspended” in air and (b) a viewer can “pass through” the
image with the hand Courtesy of PFM Multimedia (Milan, Italy)

This type of projection is very advantageous because it allows images to be reproduced
where otherwise it would be very difficult to arrange a solid projection support due to space
or light constraints or difficulties in installing conventional screens. Another advantage is
because of absolutely absence of invasiveness with respect to the environment wherein the
images are intended to be projected. Because of this, two of these machines have been
adopted in the archaeological site of Pompeii, in Italy, one representing Giulio Polibio
“talking” to the visitors and the second representing his pregnant wife swinging on a
rocking chair and caressing her baby (see Figure 11).
Stands its characteristic, the HoloMachine can find application in museums, in science
centres, in lecture theatres, in showrooms, in conference centres, in theme parks, in
discotheques, in shopping malls, in fashion shows, etc., and for product launches, special
event, entertainment purposes, advertising matters, multiplayer games, educational
purposes, .. and in general for VR applications, or even Augmented Reality applications, for
which “immersive” feeling for the user makes the difference.
From a mere technological point of view, this holographic projection technology takes
advantage of the optical properties of water, indices of reflection and refraction, for
generating a circumscribed volume of an nebulized air-water mixture, dry to the touch, that
will behave like a screen adapted for image projection. This screen can be defined as
“virtual” as it is only made of an nebulized air-water mixture, a turbulence-free “slice” of
air-water a few millimetres thick, and once it is “on”, it is possible to reproduce moving
images on it, thereon using the more or less traditional methods such as the video
projection, laser projection, live shot projection with video-projector, etc. (see Figure 12).
Since the light coming from the video-projector is reflected/transmitted with angles which
depend on the position of the illuminated point of the air-water “slice” (the inner/outer
point of the slice, the narrower/wider the reflection/transmission angle), the viewer
experiences a sort of “holographic” view, since he/she has the illusion of the depth, having
two offset images from the same source but separated to each eye.

of Pompeii in Italy (Courtesy by PFM Multimedia Company)

In principle this machine can generate images of any size. The limit is due to the technology
adopted to eject the air-water mixture for which it depends the distance the air-water
mixture keeps its consistency, before spreading all around. But, according to fluid-mechanic
principles, a mixture of air-water which is denser than the surrounding air, could help to
stabilize the system. Of course, if the machine is utilized in open space, the air-water
mixture might be ruffled by a blast of wind but, when it occurs, the “slice” itself would refill
with air-water and the images are reformed really very quickly, as well as it happens if a
person goes through the screen.
The machine project design was conceived in a way that people would not get wet when
passing through the “screen” and that the machine could operate within a broad range of
environmental conditions, particularly thinking about the surrounding light conditions. The
best viewing results are of course obtained in dark environments, but even under the direct
rays of the sun, the images can still remain appreciably visible, the limit being due only to
the light output capabilities of the projector (recommended 4500 ANSI lumen or higher),
which can be any commercially available one.
In any case, the resulting definition and colour saturation of the projected images are not
perfect (see Figure 11) and can still be improved, but this does represent a surmountable
problem. It is mainly related to some parameters such as the type of fans that pump away
from the machine the air-water mixture, the velocity the mixture reaches, the temperature,
the real dimensions of the tiny droplets, their electrostatic charge, the Reynolds Number of
the mixture flowing. So, a better image definition can be obtained with a better control of
these parameters.
Also interactivity can be implemented, realizing an “immersive” touch screen, so expanding
the application possibilities. The shown images can change, react or interact with the user as
he/she changes the laminar air flow with his/her body (or even a simple blow!), also
depending on the point/area where the laminar flow is deformed. Poke a finger at the
screen, and the nebulized air-water mixture is interrupted, allowing the system to detect
where you have “clicked”.

nothing but micro-particles of water

5. Conclusions
The final goal of VR is to deceive the five human senses in a way that the user can believe to
live in a real environment. This means that the Real Environment and the Virtual
Environment can be “confused” and the line of Figure 1 can become a circle so that the two
extremes can result in only one point.
To this aim we have to develop systems to artificially create/recreate smells, flavours, tactile
sensations, sounds and visions perceived to be physically real. After all, the Immersive VR
can be thought as the science and technology required for a user to feel present, via
perceptive, cognitive, functional and, even, psychological immersion and interaction, in a
computer-generated environment. So, these systems have to be supported by commensurate
computational efforts to realize computer-created scene, real-time rendered, and current
computer machines can be considered reasonably adequate (also because they can work in
cluster configuration with a high degree of parallelism). So, the main energies must be
devoted to the development of new sensors, capable to better “measures” of the reality and,
over all, new transducers, capable to convert an electrical signal into somewhat detectable
by human senses in a way to be confused as “real”, so that the user forgets that his/her
perception is mediated by technology.
This chapter describes the new possibilities offered by the recent technology to obtain a virtual
“vision” that has to be as “real” as possible. In such a view, panoramic 3D vision must be
preferred and the better if the images can be “realized in air”, i.e. without the adoption of a
solid screen, as well as it happens in reality. So, details were furnished of the AutoMultiScopic

20 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

for 3D Vision, in particular with the description of the Alioscopy screen, and details of the
Holo-Vision for screen-less Vision, in particular with the description of the HoloMachine.
But an immersive system must be completed with the possibility of interaction for the user
with the environment. So gestural controls, motion tracking, and computer vision must
respond to the user’s postures, actions and movements, and a feedback must be furnished,
with active or passive haptic (Insko, 2001) resources. For this reason, the HoloMachine can
be provided with sensors capable to reveal where and how its laminar flow is interrupted so
that the scene can change accordingly.

1. Introduction
1.1. Evolution of technology: Vision and goals
Like many technologies, virtual reality began as a dream and a vision. For example, the
desire to fly had to wait for technology to progress before becoming a reality. Though the
story of Icarus and Deadalus might have inspired a Leonardo to draw a bird-like flying
machine, centuries past before science and technology set the stage for flight beyond mere
kites and gliders. A high powered, light weight gas engine was one of many innovations
required for heavier than air aircrafts to become a reality in the early 20th century. Over the
course of a century, a series of innovations and inventions emerged that that were critical to
the development of modern aircrafts. Although in principal today’s aircrafts share much
with their earlier predecessors, they have capability that far exceeds those early machines.
Why it is now possible to fly at 30,000 ft in comfort, at speeds of over 500 mph, can best be
understood as the culmination of a convergence in technological development over the last
century.
The proposed replacement for the F16 fighter, the F35, was only possible with
improvements in material technology. Being composed of carbon fiber material makes this
jet a third lighter than its predecessor. With computer numeric control (CNC) the F35 is built
to tolerances not previously achieved for carbon fiber aircraft. The engine built by Pratt
&Whitney, today’s most powerful engine, produces over 50,000 lbs at weight to power
ratios much greater than could have been achieved even just a few years ago. Avionics and
sensors give “situational awareness” and provide the F35 a level of virtual intelligence and
awareness critical to mission success (Keijsper, 2007).
The piloting of these aircraft is assisted by the onboard computer capability. To assist the
pilot in making critical decisions, a helmet mounted display gives information on targets

and the aircraft’s control systems. Today’s modern jet aircrafts bear little similarity to the
early predecessors made of wood canvas and wire and yet, both fly. The technology of flight
has advanced beyond the dreams even of science fiction writers of just a century ago.
Though the goals of flight have remained the same, the form of their technological solution
has evolved in ways that could never have been imagined.
Virtual reality, in its development parallels that of flight. The simulators used in flight
training during the Second World War share much in principal with those made today for
military and passenger jets, even if they look like inventions out of retro-science fiction
movies. Built in the day when mechanical lineages and analogue electrical gauges provided
feedback in modern airplanes, these flight simulators could train air force pilots to fly in
conditions of total fog or darkness. The desire to improve on the safety record of early pilots
was the incentive for the Edwin Link to create simulators built from the same technology
used to control pipe organs of the day. Yet even these crude devices incorporated much of
what characterizes flight simulators today. With the link trainer, the student pilot was
placed inside an enclosed cockpit mounted on a 360 pivot. Once inside the cockpit, the pilot
would practice flying blind. With working controls and instruments, the pilot could practice
flying in an immersive environment complete with feedback. The stick of the link-trainer
worked like an actual airplane and allowed the trainer to turn and bank. Mimicking a real
aircraft, artificial horizons and altimeter gauges provided the pilot with the feedback need to
fly blind. Pilots would progress through a simulated mission with their route traced on a
large table with a pen mounted on a small motorized carriage. Using radio headsets,
communication between the trainer and the pilot simulated the actual sound between
ground control and pilot. Advanced models featured the full instrumentation of the modern
fighters of the day. With over 10,000 of these units built during the Second World War, they
can still be found in many air museums in North America and Europe (Link Flight Trainer,
2000).
The link simulator provides two important lessons in the history of technology. First, virtual
reality and the desire to have an immersive training environment preceded the computer
revolution that began in the 1960’s. Today’s simulators, though similar in functionality and
purpose, share little in the underlying technology used to accomplish their goal. Today’s
multimillion dollar simulators reproduce the view, sound and motion experience in a real jet
cockpit. Built on top of a six degrees of freedom motion platform, the entire cockpit of a jet
can bank, yawl and pitch as it flies under simulated conditions. When first developed, the
computing requirements for these simulators were at the cutting edge of computer
technology. Advanced graphic engines, parallel processing, high resolution graphic
displays, motion controlled platforms, and a geographic database of the world’s
topographical features are all critical milestones in the history of computing and have
contributed to the design of modern flight simulators (George, 2000). .
Second, VR as a simulation of reality has been instrumental in the advancement of the
technology it simulates, in this case flight. The ability to fly an advanced fighter jet or one of
the new generations of fly-by-wire passenger jets was dependent on the same technology

The Virtual Reality Revolution: The Vision and the Reality 23

used to create advanced simulators. For each advanced jet that flies today there is a
simulator that prepares pilots for the actual experience of flight. Companies like Boeing,
CAE and Lockheed Martin operate advanced simulators which utilize motion platforms,
high resolution graphics systems and databases containing all the world’s land features and
airports at high resolution. In these simulators which mimic almost every aspect of flying in
the cockpit, pilots can prepare themselves for such experiences as flying into bad weather or
responding to a mechanical or electrical systems failure. The safety of an entire industry
now depends on these advanced simulators and their capability to train pilots on how best
to prepare for these extraordinary events.
Millions of dollars have been invested in creating simulators for the military that have
proven indispensible for training pilots for all types of aircrafts. Simulated worlds are also
valuable tools in many fields for exploration, testing and training. But, beyond flight
simulators, advanced applications are rarely found in training and education. For example,
there are a few advanced auto simulators used to in research on passenger and driver safety
in US and Europe (NADS, 2012; Schwartz, 2003). However, given their great expense, it is
doubtful they will be used to train a young teenage driver when the alternative, a practice
permit and a shopping mall parking lot on a Sunday morning, is a simpler and less costly
first introduction to the driving experience.

1.2. Simulators and the demand for high end graphics
When computing technology was first used in the development of simulators, the
requirement for realistic simulation pushed the envelope of computing for the period. In
the 1990’s when simulators emerged as important training tools, displaying geographic
detail in real time demanded high-end graphics mainframes. In part, SGI’s early success
resulted from the creation of the ONYX Infinite Reality engine, capable of rendering
multiple views in high detail. Built for high-end rendering, an Onyx could contain up to
20, four 150 mhs processors. The Reality Engine2 Graphics system in 1998 (George, 2000;
SGI) was capable of rendering up to 2 million mesh polygons and 320 M textured pixels
per second, descriptions of these computers, which are still impressive by today’s
standards (NVIDIA, 2012), were critical to rendering the multiple views needed for each
of the cockpit windows in a flight simulator. Pilots could view in details of cities on their
flight path, and the landing and taxing to gates of any major international airport. When
these virtual reality simulators were placed on a six degrees of freedom motion platform
pilots had the experience of flying without ever leaving the ground. Today’s consumers
can have a taste of this experience by purchasing PC game programs like Flight Simulator
(Microsoft, 2012) that put you in the cockpit of a Boeing 747 or WWII fighter. With
multiple screen display, a PC with a gamer’s video card and a dedicated yoke lets the
average consumer achieve what the creators of the Link simulator could only have
dreamed of half a century ago. Though inexpensive hardware has had a critical role in the
history of VR, the demands for specific applications for work and play may be the force in
promoting the diffusion of VR in the future.

24 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

1.3. Building the market for VR
Every technology benefits from an application that creates a growing demand. Without
growth in markets, products remain in a niche supported by a few high-end users, e.g. the
flight simulator. To drive down unit costs, products must appeal to a growing audience.
Like the first computers built after the war, the demand for these costly goliaths served only
a very small number of corporate and military users. For VR to grow beyond the use in the
military and commercial aviation, a new group of potential users would have to be found.
This would require the development of hardware and software solutions for medicine,
architecture, urban planning and entertainment. Unlike flight simulators designed for a
single task, the approach was to accommodate a range of applications in a multipurpose VR
facility. Ultimately, this strategy could expand the number of potential users. CAVE’s with
multiple screens displaying content in 3D would seem to have offered a technological
solution that would satisfy a range of users. With government research support, many
universities and national labs established virtual reality centers, which were to offer
engineers, design professionals, urban planners and medical researchers with a much
needed facility for advanced visualization.

2. Applications of VR
2.1. The design of cities
In the 1990’s, universities had sufficient funding to acquire sophisticated computing power.
For example, UCLA obtained an SGI ONYX. In this facility Los Angeles city planners were
given a first opportunity to visualize urban form in an immersive environment. Rather than
crowding around a computer monitor to view data, specialized projection screens enabled
planners and government officials to experience and evaluate development proposals
within a life size 3D virtual world. The work of Jepson and Liggett at UCLA offered a
glimpse into a future that promised public participation into the urban design process
(Hamit, 1998; Jepson & Friedman, 1998; Liggett and Jepson, 1993). In their simulator, it was
possible to see the impact of "what if questions" while driving down the city streets of Los
Angeles.
VR had promising beginnings with several cities taking up the challenge of using VR as a
tool in urban planning. Several universities would be in the vangard of this movement,
following in the footpaths of Liggett and Jepson, including the University of Toronto and
the New School for Social Science Research in New York. Creating VR environments with
detailed virtual cities required the time and resources of CAD modelers and programmers
(Drettakis, G., Roussou, M., Reche, A. & Tsingos, N., 2007; Batty, M., Dodge, D., Simon. D. &
Smith, A., 1998; Hamit, 1998) . Since the 1990’s many North American, European and Asian
governments have created CAD models of their cities, but they are often used to produce
animations, rather than used to enhance the planning process (Mahoney 1994; Mahoney
1997; Littelhales 1991) . Animations are important as part of marketing campaigns to
promote, for example, a new train line, landmark commercial development or public space.

The Virtual Reality Revolution: The Vision and the Reality 25

Without a driving interest by the professional planner to use VR in urban design and
planning, its application over the last two decades has been limited to the exceptional case.
Even today with GIS to easily show a city’s buildings in 3D, models of a city are largely
inaccessible to planners who often lack training and access to their corporate GIS.
Though planning has embraced the charette, open house and web-based survey, the
discipline has yet to grab hold of design in real time. In part, this is a problem of logistics
and cost. Finding facilities adequate to hold even half a dozen individuals is difficult. For
those wishing to display 3D worlds in stereo, the price of glasses, special projectors or
displays makes the technology out of reach for most city governments (Howard & Gaborit,
2007). Finally, there is a cultural dimension of planning practice which limits the adoption of
VR. Planning is still largely done in a 2D world. Zoning maps and plot plans are easily
stored, visualized and analyzed in 2D. Even for planners who have received their education
during the last decade, an introductory course in CAD or GIS may not have been required.
The older generations of planners, now in more senior positions, are even less likely to be
knowledgeable GIS and CAD users ( Mobach, 2008; Wahlstrom, M, Aittala, M. Kotilainen,
H. Yli-Karhu, T. Porkka, J. & Nyka¨nen, E. 2010; Zuh, 2009).
Potentially, the impact of land use change on future development could be better
understood using simulation tools of the kind used by transportation planners in designing
and maintaining a road system for a city. Yet, most planning departments rarely use such
modeling approaches. In contrast, the game world since 1985 has had a simulation tool, SIM
City, which allows anyone with a PC to manage a city’s budget and understand the impact
of land use planning on the future development of the city (Simcity, 2012). Interestingly, a
land use planning tool designed for professional city planners has yet to be become the
norm in urban planning practice. Without the vision for what simulation can do for
planning, serious tools have yet to appear in practice. Without the commitment to a vision
of what potentially could be accomplished through the application of computer technology,
these tools will await future development. Furthermore, land use policy can be
implemented and enforced without the benefit of an advanced information system. In fact,
VR and other advanced visualization technology may be counter productive to the planning
process. Visualization of proposed development, if not carefully introduced to the political
electorate, may incite adverse reactions from the public and create more work for the
planners and their staff (Al-Douri 2010, Forester 1989; Mobach, 2008). Advanced modeling
and simulation for this reason may not always be seen as a beneficial by practicing planners.

2.2. The rebirth of physical urban models
Recent innovation in 3D printing may actually reinforce the use of a physical model over
that of the virtual world, when it comes to visualizing the future urban form of cities. With
lower costs associated with 3D printing, it is now possible to create plastic models directly
from CAD models. In the past, the expense of creating a model of a city with all of its
buildings was not a simple task. Scale models of an entire city required teams of artists and
cartographers to complete. Unlike paper maps and drawings, you would also need a large

26 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

space for storage and examination. Brest, Cherbourg and Embrun are examples of a few
cities for which scale models were commissioned by Louis XIV and constructed under the
direction of Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban (Marshall of France, b1663-d 1707) Known for
his publications on siege and fortification, Vauban supervised the creation these models as
important tools in the preparation of military defenses (de Vauban, 1968) Ultimately, more
than 140 of these models were constructed for the King of France(Lichfield). In the 20th
century, there are numerous examples of these types of large scale models. The most
impressive include those representing Daniel Burnham’s Plan commissioned for the
Chicago Foundation in 1909, a model of Rome commissioned by Mussolini, the model of
Los Angeles built under the WPA’s in the 1930’s and a model of Moscow completed in
1977(Itty Bitty Cities, Urbanist).
In the 1980’s under Donald Appleyard, Director of the Environmental Urban Lab,
University of California, Berkeley, College of Environmental Design, a full scale model of
San Francisco was constructed(Environmental Simulation Laboratory). Prior to the use of
computer modeling, this physical model served an important role in assessing the impact of
new development on the immediate surroundings. By employing a video camera mounted
with a model scope fixed to a moving gantry, it was possible to drive along roads and view
the existing city and proposed developments. These models lit by an electric lamp were also
capable of simulating the sun and shade at various times of the year. By examining
alternative plans for development within this physical model it was possible to have a tool
for facilitating public review of urban projects.
With the recent introduction of inexpensive 3D printing, it is now possible to create 3D
models of entire cities. Like models of the past, such models of Tokyo, Toronto, and New
York offer a bird’s eye view of a large area (Itty Bitty Cities, Urbanist). Though the virtual
version would offer greater flexibility in data retrieval, viewing alternative design concepts,
understanding impact of zoning, and having physical representations are considered highly
desirable by government officials, planners and architects. Like Lego Land and doll houses
there is a strange attraction to such miniature worlds that is difficult to comprehend on a
rational level.

2.3. Architecture and the art of image making
Advancements in BIM (Building Information Modeling) and CAD has given the architecture
profession new tools for creating buildings. BIM can offer designers a completely interactive
design space. Buildings can be designed from the ground up in a virtual environment.
Using a host of simulation tools it is now possible to work collaboratively with the client
and other consultants on the design of a building. Though it would appear to offer
advantages over more traditional tools, it is yet to be an approach universally accepted by
architects within their culture of design (Levy 1997; Novitski 1998). Since the Renaissance, it
was through the art of drawing that architects distinguished themselves from the building
trades. Even today architects differentiate themselves from engineers and urban planners by
their artistic abilities and talents. Beginning in the 15th, architects of the stature of

The Virtual Reality Revolution: The Vision and the Reality 27

Michelangelo, Sebastiano Serlio Palladio and Bramante employed the plan, elevation and
section to create their designs(Kostoff 1977; Million 1997; Palladio, 1965). Knowledge of
these drawing conventions, first mentioned in the oldest surviving architectural treatise by
Vitruvius, Il Quattro Libri (1st Cent AD) are still considered essential skills for architecture
students today (Kostoff 1977; Vitruvius 1960). One important aspect of orthographic
constructions (plan, section, elevation) is the ability to take direct measurement from the
scaled drawings. Borrowing from these established drawing conventions, CAD applications
reflect the architect’s preference for working in plan and elevation for determining design
solutions. Visualizing the design in perspective occurs after the architect has created his
concept in plan.
Perspective as a tool emerged during the Renaissance with the inventive work of Filippo
Brunelleschi (1377-1456). Borrowing from the theory of optics and the mathematics of the
period, Brunelleschi should be credited in creating the first augmented reality device. Using
a set of mirrors, Brunelleschi was able to position a perspective drawing of the Baptistery of
Florence onto a view of it in the Piazza Santa Maria, thus demonstrating that the new
science of perspective drawing could simulate reality. The actual device consisted of two
mirrors. The first of the two mirrors would be positioned in front of your eye. A small hole
at the centre would allow you to view a second mirror, which was placed showing a
perspective view of the Baptistery. When standing in front of the Baptistery in the exact
same location from which the perspective was constructed (as a mirror image) the observer
would see the image of the perspective reconstruction of the baptistery superimposed over
its actual location. Varying the distance between the two mirrors would change the size of
the perspective image relative to the actual surroundings. By removing the mirror furthest
from the eye, the observer could compare the actual image with the perspective
construction. Offered as proof that perspective was a tool for presenting how an architect’s
design would look when constructed, perspective would become a device for presenting
both the real and the imagined (Collier, 1981; Edgerton, 1974). In the 16th and 17th century,
perspective would become particular useful in the design of stage backdrops for fantastic
architectural scenes used in opera and the theatre. Giovanni Maria Galli-Bibiena is perhaps
one of the most important artist of this period whose work would grace the opera houses of
Europe and would later be published as engravings by Christopher Dall'Acqua, and JA
Ambrose Orio Pfeffel in 1731 (Pigozzi 1992).
Though a perspective drawing is an important visualization tool for architects, it is mostly
relegated to the role of a presentation graphic. Often created for the client’s benefit,
perspective drawings are not the working tools of architects. Instead, it is the plan and
elevation that serves the architect during the conceptualization and construction process. In
published works by Andrea Palladio and Inigo Jones, their skillful use of plan and elevation
is still studied by today’s architects (Kostoff, 1977; Million 1997; Palladio, 1965). Later this
approach to design would be adopted by the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris. With an
emphasis on acquiring a high level of proficiency in creating high quality images in ink and
color washes, the school’s graduates would dominate the teaching ranks of architecture in
the US and Europe during the period in the 20th century prior to emergence of modernism.

28 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

Even with the emergence of the Bauhaus in the 1920’s, programs of architecture in the US or
Europe would still demand expert draftsmanship from their graduates (Kostoff, 1977, Levy
1980).
Once a design is approved by the client, architects create the working drawings needed for
the bidding and construction phase. In the past, working drawings were drawn in pencil or
ink on velum to create the needed blueprints. The process of creating “working drawings”
was a significant part of practice, consuming many hours of draftsmen’s time. Photos of
architects’ offices from the last century often show junior architects working on drafting
tables producing the drawings, which today would be printed on wide carriage plotters. In
practice, changes and additions are part of the design process. With paper drawings, even a
simple change, like the replacement of one window style with another could require hours
of redrawing. Beginning with the introduction of CAD (computer aided design) in the
1980’s, architects were relieved of the burden of having to make endless changes to paper
drawings. CAD offered advantages over the traditional drawing methods used by architects
since the Renaissance, but for many architects, the art of drawing distinguished them from
engineers and technicians (Kostoff, 1977; Levy, 1997). Even when the interactive age of
design seemed imminent, CAD was never widely adopted. Today, the culture of
architectural design has yet to fully embrace the use of advanced CAD tools in design.
Within an architectural firm, decisions rest with the senior partners; often, they are
uncomfortable with the new CAD technology. For this reason, these new tools are the used
primarily by technicians to create construction documents. Virtual reality design, a hopeful
prospect in 1990’s has yet to be fully developed or implemented.
With the advancement of BIM in recent years, architects have new tools for design and
construction management. With BIM, an extension of CAD tools from the 1980’s, it is
possible to create integrated design solutions from concept to finished drawings. The design
process begins with the development of a massing solution that responds to the urban
context of zoning, adjacency of other buildings, and topography. Once a massing solution is
produced, architects can move to the next phase of the interior space plan, which must
respond to the needs of the program. At this stage, design becomes a multi-dimensional
problem. BIM can provide both the senior and junior architect with a testing environment.
BIM tools encompass the full range of design activities including the structural frame,
HVAC system, and the electrical and mechanical systems. It can even analyze the flow of
pedestrians responding to an emergency evacuation. Potential conflicts can be resolved
early in the design process, rather than after the project begins, when changes and additions
would need to be made to working drawings. In a virtual design environment, the
production of documents for bidding is a matter of freezing the design solution. Unlike the
past when drawings were inked on vellum, these virtual buildings can now be sent
electronically to the general contractor responsible for the actual construction of the
building. Using software like Autodesk’s Navistar, it is now possible to plan for every
aspect of the construction process. This includes the critical placement of cranes that
accommodate the lifting of all materials to higher floors in the case of commercial buildings
(Autodesk, 2012).

The Virtual Reality Revolution: The Vision and the Reality 29

2.4. Accommodating the design process: The work environment and architecture
Design requires the participation and involvement of a team of professionals. For a large
scale project, sharing and working with a large number of documents, drawings and CAD
models requires a versatile and flexible work space. Traditionally, at the early stages in the
development of a design, critical decisions are reviewed by sitting around a boardroom
table with documents strewn on the table’s surface. With drawings pinned to the walls,
architects with notebooks and pens in hands, sketch, take notes, and exchange ideas about
possible design solutions. The history of VR is one marked by the need for specially
designed hardware and rooms needed to view a virtual world. This includes some of the
earliest hardware, Sensorama in 1956, the work of Ivan Sutherland in 1960’s, followed by
more advanced hardware used for flight simulators and CAVE installations in the 1980’s
and 1990’s. Hardware solutions required for interactive viewing has always been expensive
and cumbersome to use in group settings. Imagine conducting a group design session with
HMD’s or wearing shutter glasses in a CAVE environment (Benko, Ishak & Feiner 2003,
2004; Coltekin 2003; Sutherland, 1965; Zhu, 2009). The cultural context of design always
needs to be considered if VR technology is to gain greater acceptance among architects. If
VR is to be used in the design, then it needs to support the culture of design. Visiting a dark
room or isolating individual users with helmets and gloves will probably be never
acceptable for architects.
Internet-based solutions for distributing work among collaborators may have had a greater
impact on architecture design than VR. Today, a process of distributing work is becoming
the norm in architectural practice. At the commencement of a project, a senior designer
meets with the client to discuss objectives and concerns. Drawings, sketches or simple
massing models created in a program like Sketchup may be used to establish the constraints,
opportunities and context of the project. Commonly, many senior designers without
education in CAD, provide their sketches or even models to staff for later conversion into
CAD models. Frank Gehry, the architect of the Walt Disney Concert Hall and Guggenheim
Museums in Bilbao and the Experience Music Project in Seatle is often cited as an architect
who works from models which are later converted into CAD format by his staff architects.
Once in CAD form, models can be shared between client, partners in other offices and
consulting engineers (Kolarevic, 2003). For larger international firms distributing these tasks
over several offices is the trend. By passing a project at the end of the day to associates in
another part of the world at the beginning their day, a project can be completed more
quickly by using a full 24 hour working day. This approach has two significant advantages.
First, it allows firms to shorten the time required to complete a single design cycle. More
important, firms can take advantage of lower wage scales abroad. Over the last decade
architectural offices have employed designers, drafters, and CAD technicians in China and
India, where the wages are significantly lower. By engaging firms that specialize in
architectural design and production, a dramatic reduction is possible in the cost of working
drawings, specifications and computer models used to produce high quality animations and
renderings (Bharat, 2010; Pressman, 2007).

30 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

VR is making progress in changing the approach to design for interior design by major
house ware retailers. IKEA now offers on-line a design tool that gives the prospective
buyer an opportunity to layout a complete kitchen. The user can begin with the floor
dimensions of their kitchen area and then add cabinets and appliances. Working in 3D
they can alter styles for the cabinet, wood finishes, materials for the kitchen tops and the
choice of appliances. By examining these designs in 3D, the client has an opportunity to
create a virtual world of their future kitchen. Once completed, an order list and price
sheet is generated for the store to complete the sales transaction with the client. Already,
IKEA is experimenting with home design and will complete a major housing project in
Europe in 2012. Perhaps the future of interactive design lies with manufacturers of
homes where complete environments are delivered to the job site for quick assembly.
(IKEA, 2012).

2.5. Archaeology and VR
Virtual Rome, developed under the direction of Bill Jepson at UCLA, was one of the first
projects to take advantage of the rendering capability of the SGI ONYX reality engine. Using
technology first developed for the film industry a computer model of the entire ancient city
of Rome could be rendered in real time. A major attraction at conferences like SIGGRAPH
and AEC (Architects, Engineering and Construction), this model of Rome was displayed on
large panoramic screens in 3D. With the support of GOOGLE in recent years, the Virtual
Rome Project can now be viewed in Google Earth, though the visual impact is much less on
the small screen. The success of the Virtual Rome Project has fostered the creation of other
virtual historic models including those of Jerusalem and Pompeii. More than models, these
worlds can support virtual tours complete with guides that provide historical background
and information. When viewed in 3D environments, on panoramic displays or in Geodes,
like the one found in Paris, researchers and the public have a new venue for viewing and
studying these ancient sites (Fore and Silotti, 1998; Frischer; 2004 Firscher, 2005; Rome
Reborn; 2012; Ancient Rome, 2012)
With the appearance of long and short range scanners, archaeologist have been capturing
data on historic sites and building. Once captured, it is possible to use this data to
reconstruct these sites in their entirety by reproducing missing elements. One of the more
notable projects involves the reconstruction of the Parthenon. Under the direction of Paul
Debevec of UC Irvine, a team was assembled to scan both the Parthenon in Athens and
plaster copies of the Elgin Marbles, which are preserved in Bern Switzerland. By adding the
missing sculptures found in the pediment to the virtual model, it was possible to see for the
first time in almost 200 years the Parthenon complete with all of its sculptural detail.
Animations and images from this model were later used to promote the Olympics in Athens
2008. The ability to recreate an environment free of smog may be an additional benefit of
viewing these models in virtual space (Addison 2000; Addison, 2001; Eakin, 2001; Levoy,
2000; Tchou, et al, 2004; Stumpfel, et al, 2003).

The Virtual Reality Revolution: The Vision and the Reality 31

2.6. Medicine
Visualization technology has been instrumental in the advancement of medical science,
beginning in the Renaissance with the printing of Vesalius, De Humani Corporis Fabrica
Librie Septem in 1543 (Saunders, 1973; Vesalius, 1998). Though theory perpetuated by the
Galen still persisted long after his death in 199 AD, the publication of this treatise would
eventually transform medical science. The illustrations contained in this tome were based
completely on human dissection, revealing all the organs and skeletal structure of the
human body and transforming the study of medicine and anatomy. With the advancement
of imaging and computing, this approach has been extended. It is now possible to transform
an individual’s MRI data into a virtual model of the individual patient, opening new doors
to medical diagnosis. Using advanced 3D imaging, the “Lindsay Virtual Human” allows a
student of medicine to examine the human anatomy at any scale: organs, tissues and cells.
Furthermore, unlike the printed page, this virtual human is completely interactive. With the
ability to simulate physiological processes, the virtual human can be used to help medical
students understand life processes in real time. Viewed in stereo displays or mobile touch
devices, “Lindsay Virtual Human” provides access to a virtual living being ( Lindsay, 2012;
Von Mammen, et al, 2010).
In the use of virtual models in surgery, a major challenge has been to develop haptic
peripherals that allow the surgeon to have needed feedback to perform delicate operations.
Without sensitive feedback from surgical instruments, the response of actual tissues and
organs to incisions made by surgical tools would not be experienced realistically in the
virtual world. In many areas of surgery, including removal of brain tumors, the virtual and
the real have merged to create an approach for performing challenging surgical operations.
In the 1980’s during early days of robotic surgery, only pre-operative images were used to
guide the surgeon. Robots compatible with MRI’s in 1990’s were developed that provided
the surgeon with images reflective of the patient’s condition throughout the surgery. Over
the last two decades improvements to neurosurgical robots have included better imaging
technology that can distinguish soft tissues, a robot with a full 6 degrees of freedom, and
greater precision in the actual surgical instrumentation. Filtering out a surgeon’s hand
tremor has made for a much higher level of precision in these delicate procedures. Though
robotic surgery is still far too expensive for general use, its continued development shows
promise. With improvement in artificial intelligence, kinesthetic feedback and user interface,
neurosurgery will see more robots assisting surgeons in the operating room (Greer, 2006;
Howe & Matsuoka, 1999; Sutherland, 2006).

2.7. Games
VR has had the greatest universal impact on society in the merging of play and computing
(Johnson 1999; Shaffer et al, 2004). Even in the early days of computing when all computing
was done on mainframes, a first space war game created by Steve Russell at MIT in 1962
allowed the user to control a spaceship in a world where gravitational forces shaped the
strategy for destroying adversaries. Later this game would be released as an arcade game in

32 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

1971 and became one of the first games to employ vector graphics. Interestingly, this early
arcade game can still be purchased in its arcade form by game officinatos (Space Wars,
2012). With each improvement in graphics and computing power, games were able to attain
a higher level of realism. Better shadows, real water, particles, photorealistic lighting, and
more life-like characters provided gamers with experiences that mirrored those found in the
real world. Today, games can simulate every aspect of life, real or imagined, on PC’s or
game consoles. Driving games, flight simulators, fantasy, role playing and war games are a
few of the genres that have spawned from an industry that competes with the movie
industry in size and value. With each new release, higher levels of graphics and realism are
anticipated by gamers. It is now possible to simulate photo realistic lighting and
architectural details as a game player drives through European cities while competing in the
Grande Prix. In simulations of military combat, series like “Call of Duty” have re-created the
war theatre for many of the famous engagements in Europe during the Second World War II
(Call of Duty, 2012). More recently Activision, the developer of “Call of Duty’, has turned to
military engagements in the Middle East and wars placed in the future. Within these game
environments, groups of combatants are able to play against each others (MMOG). Success
in these MMOG’s requires both time and dedication. The addictiveness and interest in war
games has not been lost on the US Military( Johnson, 2004; Johnson, 2010; Stone, 2002). With
America’s Army 3, developers have created a game that that allows participants to
experience life in the military in a massive on-line experience. In this world, you can fire
weapons and participate in elite combat unites ( US Army, 2012). Perhaps the military’s
most successful recruiting tool, America’s Army Game, this virtual world allows you to
assume roles and responsibilities of battle field soldiers and to train for a variety of missions.
Virtual worlds are not limited to recent historical events. In the Assassin’s Creed series, the
opportunity is given to engage enemies in worlds that mix historical fact and fantasy. In
Assassin’s Creed series the gamer is placed in 15th Florence and Venice. Strangely set in the
21st century, the central character Desmond Miles, having escaped from Abstergo Industries,
is forced to relive past memories in a virtual past. Rendered in high detail, this world would
provide a class in art and architectural history with a virtual classroom to view some of the
greatest achievements of the Renaissance. Assassin’s Creed with its open world play
environment established a new level of visual accuracy in detail for a virtual world even if
there is an occasional mixing of content from different historical periods.(Assassin’s Creed,
2012) Unfortunately, time is of the essence in this game. The mission to avenge the murder
of father and brothers leaves little time to gaze upon architectural wonders of the past.
Gamers who demand a high level of emersion in their visual filed of view can now purchase
3D TV’s and 3D monitors that offer the quality of a 3D movie experience at a price only
slightly higher than that of the average display. With movie theaters and production
companies capitalizing on the 3D movie experience, this feature can now be added to most
game experiences. Many games today are 3D ready and only require a video card that
supports 3D, as well as either a 3D TV or a computer screen. By purchasing peripherals
developed to support a specific game genre, a completely immersive experience is possible,
whether flying a plane, driving a car or fighting off the enemy.

The Virtual Reality Revolution: The Vision and the Reality 33

The Wii in 2006 introduced a new level of interaction and immersion to gamers. No longer
did the user need to rely on a game controller that required hours of practice to master.
Instead, the Wii controller uses motion sensing, a few buttons and gesture to control the
virtual world. Using the Wiimote, a tennis rackets or a sword can be simulated and with
purchased attachments, the action of a driving wheel and other devices can be imitated
(Nintendo, 2012). Since the introduction of the Wii by Nintendo, Microsoft and Playstation
have introduced game player controllers. Furthermore, the Kinect by Microsoft, employs
real time mapping of the human form and gives gamers a sense of freedom by eliminating
the need for any game controller (Microsoft, 2012). Even the youngest of game players
quickly learn how to ski jump, play tennis or bowl in these virtual games. After several
decades of experimentation, virtual reality has a universal audience of devoted gamers.

2.8. Military applications
The demonstrated value of flight simulators in training would spawn other applications of
VR to the field of military training. Tank simulators are an example where VR would
provide a valuable training environment. Inside an enclosed replica of an actual tank,
gunners and drivers can maneuver and fire. Because tanks have a limited field of vision,
simulating their view does not require high resolution graphic displays and expensive six
degrees of freedom motion control platforms. Like a MMOG, tanks can be networked
together. With coordination from central command, tank groups can practice field
maneuvers. Today, the ability to link together training environments consisting of planes,
tanks, and ships provides the military with opportunities to train and test strategies that
require the coordination from central command of numerous combatants in the field, the air
and on the sea (Johnson, 2004; Johnson, 2010; Stone, 2002).
Coordinated efforts of actual infantry on the ground in a true simulation of actual battles are
the ultimate VR challenge. One solution which has been used for decades is to build mock
villages for soldiers to practice their engagements. Still used today to prepare soldiers for
conflicts in the Middle East, these towns and villages are inhabited by actors speaking the
language of the countries where the troops are to be stationed. More recently, a completely
virtual experience has been created using the most advanced motion capture and immersive
technology. VIRTSIM, designed and developed as a joint venture between Ratheton
Corporation and Motion Reality, Marietta, GA, is similar to the holodeck featured in Star
trek from TV and film. In a space as large as a basketball court, a dozen soldiers wearing
high resolution wireless 3D glasses can engage simulated combatants in a completely virtual
world. Being able to view each member of the platoon as they engage virtual combatants
provides the trainers with a unique perspective. In addition, it is now possible reconstruct
actual troop engagements based on pervious battles logs from GPS transponders. To
simulate battlefield conditions, each soldier wears electrodes that respond to virtual bullets
and bomb blasts (Economist, 2012; Virtism 2012). Though perhaps the most expensive
interactive video game environment ever created, these virtual training environments were
outside the limits of computing and visualization until recently.

34 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

Not all simulated military training require the holodeck. In developing training
environment to teach members of the US military Arabic and Farsi, an inexpensive PC based
solution was deployed. In the Tactical Language Training System, students are introduced
to Arabic, Farsi and Levantine languages and culture through participation in a virtual
world. Like a video game, this role playing is used extensively. In these worlds, students
have an opportunity to be immersed in a game space where they interact with animated
characters in settings based on urban, rural and village life found in Iraq. An interactive
story environment engages the learner; animated characters provide feedback on both
pronunciation and dialogue. Speech recognition technology, which focuses on the most
likely responses, gives the student feedback on appropriate responses with native speakers.
This approach has shown promise even with students having limited prior experience in
foreign language instruction (Johnson et al. 2004, Johnson 2010).

3. Augmented reality
From the early days of Virtual Reality and AR (augmented reality), researchers shared any
of the same issues. Both required knowing where the user is relative to the scene in view. In
AR, it is critical to superposition computer generated content accurately on the objects and
architecture in the real world. In the early history of AR, a portable computer capable of
generating even simple wire frames of models in 3D was no small feat. Then, projecting the
content on to glasses worn by the user was an additional challenge. Cumbersome HMD
(glasses) were expensive, heavy and difficult to wear for long periods of time. Making this a
mobile solution would be almost impossible given the weight and size of laptops, batteries,
video cameras and glasses. Not surprising, the early days of AR transformed the user into a
borg-like image from Star trek. Finally, there was the need to access a database of places and
associated attributes. The potential to store some information on a PC or PDA about a
building or city existed, but a solution that would work in any locale would need to access
the Internet. In the days before Wi-Fi and cell towers, access to the internet was not assured
(Benko, Ishak & Feiner 2003, 2004; Coltekin 2003, Sutherland, 1965).
Within the last decade, AR has finally become a reality with the miniaturization of portable
and wearable technology. The diffusion of inexpensive smart phones and tablets provide a
platform capable of supporting AR based applications. With a video camera, GPS and
compass, a smart phone can access a database of content and superimpose directly into the
view of the touch screen. With the introduction of applications like Google Goggles and
Layars, developers can use the power of an image search database. Though AR applications
are still in their infancy, opportunities to apply this technology will be greatly expanded
with the diffusion of tablet computers. With the potential for displaying a larger image in
view, tablets with two video cameras, a powerful processor and access to the Internet will
make AR applications exciting for a range of uses including, tourism, architecture,
engineering, medicine, and education. Today, a foreign tourist can take a picture of a
restaurant sign and gain access to the menu in his or her own language. It would also be
possible to provide the specials of the day and the local critic’s reviews all translated in real

The Virtual Reality Revolution: The Vision and the Reality 35

time. Similarly, AR could provide a tourist with a guided tour through an historic
neighborhood and learn about the people and events that happened in the past. Filters
could be added to confine the information to recent history or perhaps, to provide the
architectural history of significant buildings in the area (Benko, Ishak & Feiner 2003, 2004;
Bimber 2005; Gutiérrez, Vexo & Thalmann 2008a, 2008b).
One limitation of GPS is that it works only in open space. Furthermore, GPS will not
provide precise superposition of content on the scene. Another strategy is to rely on object
recognition. By capturing views and matching them against a library of known objects, it is
possible to determine what the user is looking at and to provide the appropriate content
overlayed or tagged to the object. However, even when image search is not feasible, it is
possible today to use the camera in a smartphone to capture a QR Code marker, which links
to web-based content. A perfect solution for educational institutions or museums,
individuals with either a smart phone or a tablet can access text, images, video and 3D
objects (Schneider, 2010).
If carrying and pointing devices at buildings and signs feels unnatural for some users, in the
future, it may be possible to have a hands free AR environment by wearing contact lenses or
light weight glasses. Research is already promising in this area. Companies like NOKIA can
project web content onto lightweight stylish tinted glasses, complete with wireless earbuds
and a haptic wrist controller. Ultimately, it will be the users who will decide if this approach
is acceptable (Nokia, 2012).

4. Conclusions
In the 1980’s, VR was only capable of producing a scene composed of wire frame images.
Even finding a screen that could show graphics was beyond the reach of most researchers.
In 1990’s the development by SGI of high resolution real time graphics made simulators
possible and met a critical need for the military and civil aviation. Over the last two decades,
VR has been used to train pilots in simulators and provided surgeons with real time models
of the human body. Since the beginning, building a market for VR has been a challenge.
Other than commercial games, the audience for VR has been fairly limited. In creating
applications for a narrow group of users, the cost of development has restricted its diffusion.
The cost of application development includes building models, designing and animating
characters, coding behaviors and responses and building the GUI interfaces. Even a modest
virtual world requires considerable financial resources. If there are few users to bear the true
cost of development, then the application’s price will restrict it to a limited audience. If the
use of virtual environments for training and education in the workplace, home or school is
to have a promising future, reducing development costs is key.
With better scripting tools it may be possible to reduce the costs and time of developing a
VR application. Software like FlowVR, now offers programmers an integrated solution.
With FlowVR, it is possible to build worlds that merge the on-line worlds created in Second
life with Layar Augmented reality (FlowVR, 2012). By using Microsoft Xbox Kinect and

36 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

Emotiv (thought controlled headset), inexpensive hardware can be used to view and control
virtual worlds for training and education. For those who only require a simple navigation
through a virtual world, Unity, an inexpensive game engine offers a cost effective solution
for architects, planners and archaeologists to visit virtual worlds on a PC.
In the history of technology it is often difficult to predict the impact inventions will have on
society. When computers were being used to solve business problems after WWII, the
transformative power they would have on society would have been hard to imagine.
Though the exact path VR has followed may not have been predicted, its development as a
force owes much to those who had the vision and belief in its potential use to train, educate,
and entertain. Hardware and software will always be a limiting factor in the development of
VR. Similarly, an acceptable immersive solution for visualizing content will also be part of
this equation. The need to wear cumbersome head mounted displays or visit a remote site to
view a design in an CAVE has certainly limited the diffusion of VR. In creating VR
solutions, the technology must accommodate the professional culture of the user. For
architects sitting around a boardroom table or a surgeon in an operation room, the
technology must do better in the context of professional practice. Perhaps the promise is
portable personal devices like tablets and smart phones. The capability of these devices
increases with each new model. With a projected world wide use of over two billion by
2015, this platform offers the greatest hope for the future of both AR and VR (Parks
Associates, 2011). Everyone has one, and we carry them everywhere. Developers will finally
have a market sufficiently deep to create applications that serve every market and
profession. Perhaps VR is not dead, but merely ported over to a more universal accessible
platform.

1. Introduction
Virtual reality is now used as an aid to teaching and practice in a wide range of ﬁelds. In
education, surgery, architecture and many other disciplines, virtual reality provides a tool
that allows users to experience situations that could not be readily reproduced in the real
world. As virtual reality technology becomes more pervasive, there will be a rising demand
for improvements in the quality of VR displays, both in the accuracy with which they portray
the location, shape and surface detail of objects and also the speed and ﬂuidity with which the
images on the display change in response to the observer’s head movements, becoming ever
closer to the visual feedback that observers experience in the real world.
The ultimate goal of virtual reality is to present to the user computer-generated scenes in
such a manner that the user should not be aware that they are in a virtual reality system
at all – a sort of Turing test [29] for VR. To achieve this, the images should be of such high
resolution that the individual pixels cannot be distinguished, the display should change with
the observer’s head movements without perceptible lag and the rendered scenes should be
exquisitely detailed with realistically rendered three-dimensional models.
Current capability in virtual reality falls some way short of this ideal. Nevertheless, recent
advances in head tracking technology and pixel-drawing speed make this a useful point to
pause and consider the state of the art in presenting high-ﬁdelity immersive virtual reality.
Issues that we will address in this chapter include approaches to minimise tracking latency;
detection of and compensation for spatial distortions in head mounted displays and methods
to check that a rendered scene corresponds well with the real-world rays of light that are
being simulated (or ‘virtualized’). These questions are, to a large extent, independent of the
technology used.
To clarify terminology and lay a framework for subsequent discussion, we consider a
virtual reality system to be comprised of three subsystems: tracking, rendering and display.
Furthermore, we consider a ‘data pipeline’ to consist, broadly, of a real world event being
sampled by the tracker, the generation of an appropriate scene on the VR graphics computer,
and the ﬁnal rendering of pixels in the display device. In this chapter we will examine the

sources of error in each of these three subsystems, as data travels along the pipeline. First,
though, we brieﬂy consider the differences between ‘virtual’ and ‘augmented’ reality in the
context of the VR Turing test.

1.1. Virtual and augmented reality
Given the speed at which computer graphics is developing and the increasing realism of ﬁlms
based on computer-generated scenes, there is a strong argument that augmented reality will
be the ﬁrst virtual technology to pass the VR Turing test and fool observers completely as
to whether they are viewing a real or a virtual scene. Augmented reality – superimposing
computer drawn graphics on the real world – is at present best achieved with a video
see-through HMD, which uses small cameras to capture real-world images and displays them
in the HMD. The digital images can have computer graphics overlaid, augmenting the real
world scene. In practice, most systems suffer from an incorrect placement of the optic centres
of the images – the optic centres of the two cameras do not coincide with the observer’s
eyes’ optic centres, and thus lead to a mis-match between proprioception (‘muscle sense’) and
vision. In practice, appropriately placed mirrors can minimize this mis-match [12] although
most video-see-through augmented reality (AR) systems do not yet go to this trouble. There
are distinct advantages to video-see-through AR. Because only a small portion of the entire
scene is being computer-generated a great deal of computing power can be devoted to
rendering the virtual objects accurately and in detail. Also, the problem of spatially aligning
the virtual object so that it sits stably on a real surface is much easier to handle when both
the real and virtual scenes are available in electronic form. Algorithms for ensuring that this
alignment is correct can be run on each frame before display to the user, an option that is
not possible in see-through augmented reality where the user sees the real world directly and
virtual objects are superimposed, for example using a half-silvered mirror. Results in this area
even for cameras with very rapid, jerky movements, are impressive [19].
On the other hand, a technology that is unlikely to fool observers completely is a CAVE.
In a CAVE, the rendered VR scene is projected on up to 6 surfaces enclosing the observer.
Their key advantage is that the observer need only wear a light-weight pair of shutter glasses,
which provides the stereo signal to the observer’s eyes. However, CAVEs suffer from various
physical limitations, including the amount of space they require, and the fact that they can
only really accommodate one observer at a time. But most signiﬁcantly, the effective resolution
of the VR scene is dependent on the distance of the projection surface to the observer and, for
a freely-moving observer, this effective resolution will change. For our goal of virtualizing the
rays an observer would see in the real world, a CAVE-based VR system will never sufﬁce.

1.2. Head mounted displays
The majority of head-mounted displays – as the name suggests – involve miniature displays
mounted to a helmet-like structure which rests on the observer’s head, such that the displays
lay in front of the eyes. Helmet designs range from fully-enclosed helmets, typically found in
military applications, to bare-minimum ski-goggle like systems.
At present, all systems have non-negligible weight, which can be a problem for prolonged use.
Even in the shorter term, having such a weight mounted on the head will restrict freedom of

High Fidelity Immersive Virtual Reality

High Fidelity Immersive Virtual Reality3 43

movement, and introduce rendering errors during high acceleration head movements – even
when tightly strapped to the head, the weight of the headset under acceleration will ‘twist’ the
scalp and the resulting non-rigid motion will appear as lag between the observer’s movement
and the viewed VR scene.
Furthermore, all present HMDs are tethered to some form of control box. This control box
typically converts the video signal generated by the VR graphics computer, sent via VGA or
DVI cable, into the proprietary-format signal required by the custom display in the HMD. To
reduce damage from the continual usage, these tethering cables are generally sturdy, robust
and comparatively inﬂexible. VR users will be aware of the cable, and may modify their
behaviour to reduce any ‘tugging’ that the cable might cause on the HMD. This makes our
ideal “freely moving” observer less free to move. Some HMD systems offer wireless HMDs,
with the control box transmitting the video signal which is in turn detected by a battery
powered receiver connected to the HMD. While this can alleviate many of the problems
associated with thick tethering cables, the encode-transmit-receive-decode cycle of the video
frames will introduce extra latency into the system (e.g. one contemporary wireless system
adds “2 video frames latency”), which can be problematic in itself.

2. High ﬁdelity virtual reality
Consider a VR application that attempts to virtualize a natural scene – consisting of a wide
spectrum of colours, and numerous objects (e.g. trees, rocks) spanning a considerable distance
in depth. While observing this scene, the user is free to move around the scene, turn their
head, and to shift their gaze. At any moment in time, there will be an array of light rays
hitting each retina, and it is these rays – their direction, intensity and wavelength – that we
wish to duplicate in our VR system. If this is achievable for an object that is viewed from a
wide range of viewpoints (in theory, all viewpoints), then it is justiﬁable to claim that the real
object has been re-created in virtual reality, or ‘virtualized’.
With this goal in mind, what are the obstacles preventing us from creating such an application
with present-day hardware? Ultimately, these obstacles are issues of accuracy which we
discuss here in terms of spatial, temporal and spectral components.

2.1. Spatial accuracy
Spatial errors are due to a misalignment of the real and virtual rays, and can arise from an
incorrect estimation of the observer’s head pose or location, or due to mis-calibration of the
head mounted display. The ﬁrst is a technology limitation, but the latter is a largely-soluble
calibration issue.
2.1.1. Tracker accuracy
All tracking systems monitor movement by sampling changes of some continuous variable
which is sensitive to motion. Magnetic systems sample the tiny current induced in sensors
as they move through a (static) magnetic ﬁeld generated by an emitter. Inertial systems use
extremely sensitive accelerometers to sample changes in acceleration in any of the three planes
of movement. Mechanical systems use articulated arms to modify potentiometers at the joints

44 4Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

Will-be-set-by-IN-TECH

of the arms to produce a single 3D location. Finally, optical systems use three or more cameras
to reconstruct movement in 3D from multiple 2D images.
All these systems have numerous advantages and disadvantages, and the choice for any given
VR system will depend on many factors, including cost, the size of volume to be tracked, and
the types of actions/movements that will be expected in the application (e.g. walking versus
object manipulation by hand). Consideration should also be given to whether a given system
needs to combine the signals from several sensors, which may lead to discontinuities as a
tracked object moves between sensors [3].
For high-ﬁdelity VR, we have found that optical systems offer the best attributes. Multiple
cameras can be mounted to the perimeter of the tracked volume, and will track the position
of passive markers on the observer (notably, on the HMD) and on tracked objects. Modern
optical systems are real-time, using high-resolution, high-frame-rate cameras to sample the
tracked volume to a high spatial and temporal accuracy (typically less than 1mm and 10ms
respectively).
2.1.2. Spatial calibration of head mounted display
We consider the correct spatial calibration of the HMD to be one of the most critical
components of a VR system. Without calibration, users can misinterpret the virtual world
(for example, they often underestimate distances to objects which can be a symptom of an
incorrect calibration [11]). Users can also experience premature fatigue and, with severely
mis-conﬁgured HMDs, even nausea. [17, 18, 22].
Each of the HMD’s displays are characterized by a frustum, which completely determines how
3D vertices in the VR world are transformed to pixel locations in the display (see ﬁgure 1). The
frustum is determined from the HMD’s resolution in pixels (w and h), and the horizontal and
vertical ﬁeld-of-view (FOV) in degrees (x and y). From these we can compute the centre pixel
c
(c x = w2 and cy = 2h ) and the focal length ( f x = tancx( x) , f y = tany(y) ), and then compute the
intrinsic matrix:

The near- and far-clipping planes (ncp and fcp) are application dependent. The intrinsic
matrix, P, describes how view-centric 3D coordinates are transformed to 2D pixel locations.
The view-centric coordinates are obtained via the extrinsic matrix, S, which transforms the 3D
world coordinates relative to the position and orientation of the display:

where R is a 3 × 3 rotation matrix and T is a 1 × 3 translation matrix.

Using the manufacturer’s speciﬁcation, it is possible to create a pair of intrinsic matrices
for a stereo HMD. Conversely, the contents of the extrinsic matrix are entirely determined
by the position of the ‘tracked centre’ – the point that is reported by the tracking system
to the VR graphics computer – which depends on how the tracked markers are attached
to the HMD. Unfortunately, manufacturer speciﬁcations are rarely of sufﬁcient accuracy to
qualify for high-ﬁdelity VR display, and it can be very difﬁcult to obtain accurate physical
measurements from within the conﬁnes of a small HMD for the extrinsic matrix.
Instead, we need to calibrate the display. Yet, a thorough calibration is often neglected,
perhaps understandably given the difﬁculties in obtaining suitable calibration values.
We approach HMD calibration using a technique from camera calibration [27], called
photogrammetry. If we treat the HMD displays as virtual cameras, we can use a modiﬁed
version of this method to calibrate our HMD.
In Tsai’s method [27], the objective is to take multiple pictures of a calibration object of a
known geometry, and to pair the object’s corners with their corresponding pixel locations
in each of the images. Given sufﬁcient images, these point correspondences can be used to
constrain a minimization function, whose parameters are the intrinsic (ﬁve parameters: width,
height, focal length and location of the centre pixel) and extrinsic properties (six parameters:
3D position and pose) of the camera.

Our method is as follows. A camera is mounted on a table in such a way that the HMD
can be placed atop the camera and removed without moving or otherwise disturbing the
camera. The HMD is positioned in such a way that the camera can ‘see’ as much of one of
the displays as possible. A simple chequerboard grid is shown in this HMD display, and an
image of this grid is captured and saved by the camera. Each of the vertices in this image
(automatically extracted with image processing) can be paired with the known coordinates
from the generated grid in the HMD display and, hence, we have a means of converting any
camera image location to the corresponding HMD image location (see [4] for more details).
We subsequently express all captured camera image coordinates in HMD coordinates and,
crucially, we derive estimates of the HMD display frustum instead of the camera.
Ultimately, we need to know the display’s extrinsic parameters relative to the tracked centre of
the HMD. Yet, photogrammetry will give us the extrinsic parameters relative to the tracker’s
origin. If we record the HMD position and orientation at this time, we will be able to compute
this relative transform (the component D in ﬁgure 1).
The next step is to record the image locations of a tracked calibration object. Somewhat
counter-intuitively, this step must be carried out without the HMD in place. It is essential
that the camera is not moved at this time, since this preserves the relationship between the
recorded HMD chequerboard image and the corresponding 3D marker projections. Thus, we
are able to relate any camera image features to the corresponding HMD display location, as if
the HMD were in place and transparent.
Now we capture multiple images of a moving tracked marker. For each captured image, i,
we will obtain 5 numbers – the marker’s 3D location (in tracker coordinates, Xi ), and the 2D
pixel coordinate of the marker projection in the camera. At this point (and henceforth in this
section) the camera image coordinate are transformed into the corresponding HMD image
location (xi ).
The set of 3D coordinates X and 2D projections x are linked by a unique relationship – the
11 parameters which describe the frustum at the time the coordinates were recorded. The
aim of photogrammetry is to ﬁnd the 11 parameters that deﬁne this relationship. A proper
treatment of this approach is beyond the scope of this chapter (see instead [5, 7, 27] for more
information). Brieﬂy, for any hypothesized frustum, we can compute the projection of X in the
frustum image plane, to give y. The difference between x (the original 2D projection) and y
(the computed projection from X) can be used as an error measure, and minimized to provide
an estimate of the frustum’s 11 parameters (see ﬁgure 2).
We thus obtain estimated values for the HMD display’s intrinsic parameters, and its position
and pose (denoted S P in ﬁgure 1) relative to the tracker’s origin. As we discussed earlier, since
we also know the HMD tracked centre in the same coordinate frame (S T ), we are now able to
compute the transformation between the two (D):
1
D = S P S−
T

Consequently, for any HMD position (S�T ), we can now compute the appropriate optic centre
and principal ray for the HMD display.

Figure 2. The ith 3D point (Xi ) projects to the camera image plane (solid lines) as pixel xi (solid line). We
estimate an HMD frustum (dashed lines) based on the projections for many i, and from this frustum are
able to compute where Xi will project to in the new, hypothesised frustum (yi ). Due to measurement
errors, this estimate will be wrong, with an error of |yi − xi | for all i. The difference in position and shape
of the camera and frustum has been exaggerated here for illustrative purposes – after calibration, there is
typically less than one pixel error per point, and the camera and frustum will almost be coincident.

For virtual reality applications, we can easily use the estimated frustum in common 3D
graphics languages like OpenGL:
// Switch to intrinsic (projection) matrix mode.
glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION);
// Load intrinsic matrix, P.
glLoadMatrix(P);
// Switch to extrinsic (modelling) matrix.
glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW);
// Load HMD_to_optic_centre transform.
glLoadMatrix(D);
// Incorporate the latest tracker transform.
glMultMatrix(S_prime_T);
// Draw the left-eye’s scene.
drawScene();
// Repeat for the right-eye scene...

Values must be resolved for 11 parameters for each display. Inherent noise in the measurement
systems (camera and tracker) means that many samples must be captured to allow robust
estimation of these parameters. The method can be generalized to that of a single tracked
point being dynamically moved within the ﬁeld of view of the frustum. The camera, in

48 8Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

‘movie mode’, records the 2D locations of xi in real time, permitting a high number of point
correspondences to be gathered in a short period (see ﬁgure 3). We have found that 100
such correspondences are necessary for an accurate calibration, with 1000 or more being
desirable [5].

Figure 3. Graphical reproduction of one of the calibration trajectories and its projection into the frustum
image plane (not all ≈3000 points are shown, for clarity).

With the modiﬁed photogrammetry method described above, we have obtained HMD
display calibrations with a mean error less than one pixel. For reference, deriving intrinsic
parameters from the HMD manufacturer’s speciﬁcations, and extrinsic parameters by manual
measurement yielded a mean error in excess of 100 pixels. This error would be very noticeable
to the user, and is largely due to mis-measurement of the display’s principal ray when
measuring the extrinsic parameters. With trial and error this value could be reduced, but
this is precisely the kind of error that proper calibration avoids. For example, keeping our
calibrated extrinsic parameters but retaining the manufacturer’s speciﬁcations for the intrinsic
parameters gave an error of 13 pixels. In other words, an out-of-the-box HMD calibration will
be at least this bad.
We believe this is a marked improvement over existing HMD calibration methods [15, 20, 28],
although these papers did not provide pixel errors and so could not be compared directly with
our method. These methods also require many judgments from a skilled human observer
which, as we outlined above, would take a prohibitive amount of time to capture enough
samples to robustly estimate the display parameters.
Note that the optic centre and principal ray obtained using this method are actually those of
the camera, and not of the display. Our early constraint that the camera should be positioned
in order to capture as much of the HMD display as possible will generally ensure that the
difference between these two will be small. We return to this issue at the end of the chapter.

2.2. Temporal accuracy
To recreate natural viewing conditions, the latency between a head movement and the visual
consequences of the movement should be minimized. Delays at any point of the VR pipeline
will result in the perception of virtual objects lagging behind a hand or head movement, as if
attached by elastic. At moderate levels of lag (≈300ms) users begin to disassociate their own

High Fidelity Immersive Virtual Reality

High Fidelity Immersive Virtual Reality9 49

movements from the VR movement [8, 13]. In the worst cases, latency can cause usability
issues, including nausea [1, 10]. We consider now a procedure for measuring total system
latency and discuss individual elements that contribute to this. Delays will primarily arise
from the rendering system, and the tracker.
2.2.1. Rendering latency
Rendering typically involves reading coordinates from the tracker, positioning the
virtual frustum accordingly, rendering the objects in the scene, and then swapping the
freshly-rendered ‘back’ buffer to the ‘front’ buffer, which is controlled in hardware to coincide
with the sending of pixel data to the display device. The rendering step must be repeated for
the second display in a stereo HMD, and the whole cycle usually repeats at 60 Hz or more.
Thus, rendering time can be split into the following components: coordinate capture from
the tracker; graphics pre-processing (e.g. determining what to draw based on the current
coordinate); graphics rendering; swapping the ‘back’ buffer for the ‘front’ buffer (which will
introduce a delay while the graphics hardware awaits the ‘vertical sync’ of the display device,
in order to provide tear-free rendering). For a typical VR system, the HMD displays will be
updated 60 times per second, which means the total rendering time must be less than 16.7ms
if smooth animation is to be achieved (see ﬁgure 4, top).
Ultimately, the speed at which frames are rendered (and, hence, how smooth the VR scene
moves) is determined by the swapping of the display buffers, which is the last event in the
rendering cycle. This means that the tracker coordinate from which the current frame was
rendered could be nearly 16.7ms old. For simple VR scenes, rendering may only take a few
milliseconds (<4ms), and coordinate retrieval and processing could be less than a millisecond
(measured using internal timestamps in the VR application). This would mean that there
could be as much as 10ms delay introduced just waiting for the display device’s vertical sync.
Dynamically monitoring the delays at each stage of the rendering cycle would allow the
application software to alter an initial delay to accommodate a dynamically changing VR
scene, where some frames will require more rendering time than others. To the VR user, this
delayed rendering is not evident, except as reduced lag.
Speciﬁcally, the VR application software should inject time stamps into the rendering cycle,
monitor how long coordinate retrieval, rendering, etc, take and introduce a small delay to the
start of rendering each frame, before coordinates are retrieved from the tracker. In the above
example, introducing a 10ms delay at the start of the rendering cycle means that the resulting
graphics would have been rendered using a tracker coordinate that was only 6ms old, which
is a signiﬁcant reduction in latency (see ﬁgure 4, bottom).
For complex VR scenes, graphics rendering will consume more time, reducing the advantages
obtained by this delayed rendering method. Even so, the speed of rendering of complex scenes
can be improved using techniques like frustum culling, multiple-level-of-detail models, and
GPGPU programming, a proper treatment of which is beyond the scope of this chapter. The
reader is guided toward the multitude of real-time graphics books available.

Figure 4. Minimizing tracker latency in a frame-rate limited VR application. Most of the computer’s
time is spent waiting for the display’s vertical sync, which can mean that any given VR scene is from a
tracked coordinate as much as 16.7ms old (top). By inserting a deliberate pause before capturing
coordinates, the computer spends less time waiting for the display’s Vsync, and the resulting VR scene is
much younger (bottom).

2.2.2. Tracker latency
The tracking system will inevitably introduce a delay between a real world event (such as
a head movement) and the corresponding movement of the VR scene in the HMD display.
The real world event must be sampled using, for example, video cameras, which will have
their own inherent frame rate and transmission time of the captured event to the motion
processor. The motion processor must interpret the incoming signal, estimate the 3D structure
of the tracked objects (e.g. from multiple camera images), apply ﬁltering to reduce noise, and
package the tracking data into a suitable data protocol before sending the data down the
output medium (e.g. serial or Ethernet cable) to the graphics computer. Even on the very
fastest hardware, this whole procedure takes a ﬁnite amount of time, and the latency – or
lag – introduced will be ultimately manifest in the HMD display as a disassociation between
movement and visual scene, especially for movements with high acceleration. Indeed, tracker
latency has been described as “the largest single error source” in VR systems [9, page 134].

In the following section we describe a method for measuring the overall latency of the system.
Computer graphics processing is now so fast that it contributes little to the overall latency,
leaving the tracker as the largest source of delays.
2.2.3. Measuring overall latency
It is important to be able to measure the overall latency from head movement to image change
for a VR system. It is not simple to deduce this value from manufacturers’ speciﬁcations as
there are several steps in series with potentially important delays between each.
An easy way to measure latency is to use a standard video camera to record a movie of a
tracked object being moved in a roughly sinusoidal motion, fronto-parallel to the frustum.
Also within the camera’s ﬁeld of view, is a computer monitor showing a VR scene of the
tracked object. Using image processing, it is possible to extract the 2D coordinates (in pixels)
of the tracked object, and its corresponding rendering on the computer monitor. This results
in two streams of sinusoidal coordinates to which a root-mean-squared error (RMS) can be
assigned to indicate the difference between the two streams. Minimizing the RMS error (e.g.
with a gradient descent algorithm) yields the latency between the real-world event, and the
commensurate changes in the HMD display (see ﬁgure 5).
Unfortunately, we are not just measuring the latency of the tracker, but also of the
communication system between tracker and graphics PC, the decoding of tracked coordinates,
the rendering of the 3D model, the delay before the rendered pixels appear on the monitor
display, and the delay before those pixels are captured by the camera. However, we know
the refresh rate of the monitor (60Hz, in this case, so a new image every 16.7ms) and of the
camera (100Hz), and the amount of time the graphics PC spends on decoding coordinates and
rendering (less than 1ms). We can thus assume the mean latency added by our measurement
procedure to be 16.7/2 + 10/2 + 1 ≈ 12ms. We can subtract this number from the total
measured latency to obtain the delays introduced by the tracker and communication protocol.
Using this method, we have measured latencies in three different tracking systems. An
acoustic/inertial system added between 15 and 45ms depending on how many tracked
devices were attached. A magnetic tracker showed latencies varying between 5 and 12ms
for a single tracked object. A real-time optical tracker, with nine cameras tracking a single
object with 4 markers, had a mean tracker latency less than 10ms.
Note that this method is independent of any possible latency introduced by the video
camera. Since all coordinates are extracted from the frames of the recorded movie, latency
in the camera’s own image capture, compression, and storage do not impact the subsequent
analysis.
Also note that the method does not include any additional delays that may be introduced by
the controller for the HMD displays. Some HMDs may render the incoming video stream
directly to the HMD displays resulting in no additional delay. Other systems, particularly
those using digital wireless transmission, will need to decode the incoming signal to internal
video store before forwarding to the HMD displays, adding at least one frame of latency. Such
delays can only be measured by repeating the above procedure with the camera mounted
inside the HMD, yet still able capture images of the real world. The compact nature of most
HMD displays makes this a technical challenge.

extraction of the centroids of the tracked object (solid line, overlaid onto camera image) and virtual
object (dashed) easier (b). Plotting the lateral component of the two trajectories, aligned by camera
frame, shows a small horizontal offset between the peaks (c). Finding the horizontal displacement of the
tracked object which minimizes the RMS error (dotted line) between the two curves gives a measure of
the latency in the system, about 60ms in this example (d).

2.3. Spectral
In our quest for true virtualization of light rays, we must consider the intensity and spectral
composition (wavelength) of the rays, and how well modern HMD displays are able to
produce such rays. Here, though, are numerous problems:
• display gamut – the displayable range of colours (gamut) of modern display technologies
is signiﬁcantly smaller than the gamut of the human eye.
• contrast – most modern HMD displays use some variation of liquid crystal display (LCD)
technology. While these displays have many attributes making them suitable for HMDs,
they do rely on back-lighting (illumination behind the crystals) to make the image visible.
Unfortunately, the crystals can not be made completely opaque and will still allow some of
the back-lighting to permeate through, so it is impossible to create a true black pixel. This
can lead to contrast ratios (luminance of the brightest possible pixel to the darkest) as little
as 100:1. At the time of writing, organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays are maturing
rapidly and, as their name suggests, they emit light where needed, without the need for
uniform back-lighting, and can achieve contrast ratios of 1000000:1.

• colour generation – some display technologies employ some ‘tricks’ to generate or
improve colour appearance, but which can introduce artifacts. The authors have used a
cathode-ray-tube (CRT) HMD, where the CRT itself was a greyscale unit, but a clever set
of colour ﬁlters permitted colours to be displayed. While the gamut produced was on-par
with other true-colour CRT systems, slight mis-alignment of the colour ﬁlters did introduce
a distinct purple tinge toward the bottom of the display, which was not user-correctable.
In another HMD based on liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS) technology, the display was
only capable of displaying colours to 6 bits resolution per colour channel. It used a Frame
Rate Control algorithm to create the appearance of more colours. While the end result was
generally agreeable, such a display would be unsuitable for high-ﬁdelity colour work.
• miniaturization – the desire to make the displays small and portable may lead to
compromises in their construction, which may manifest as compromised colour ﬁdelity.
• customer needs – For most VR users, colour ﬁdelity is less of an issue than spatial and
temporal accuracy. Manufacturers will therefore place less emphasis on colour ﬁdelity
when choosing displays for their HMDs.
Assessing the spectral properties of a conventional computer monitor would require pointing
a spectrometer at a region of the display and recording the CIE 1931 xyY values for a set of test
colours, and computing the gamut. Performing the same procedure for a given HMD display
is made somewhat harder by the limited access to the HMD displays – quality spectrometers
are large and will not ﬁt within most helmet-based HMD designs. Furthermore, modern
LCD-based HMD’s are likely to be more difﬁcult to calibrate satisfactorily [23]. Even so, it
maybe possible to calibrate an HMD to some extent using a visual comparison technique [2].

3. Applications
One of the applications of virtual reality is in vision research. Immersive virtual reality
allows experimental control of the visual scene in ways that would not be possible in the real
world. This ability is critical for exploring the mechanisms of human vision in freely moving
observers. Free movement is, of course, the normal, general case but vision is rarely studied in
this state by comparison with the intensive investigation of static-observer vision. It is not just
a practical issue. Many experiments are carried out in real-world scenes with parameters such
as the direction of a pointer or the distance of a comparison object being changed physically
and, of course, virtual reality circumvents these laborious aspects allowing data to be gathered
in much larger quantities. In addition, though, virtual reality permits stimuli that would be,
to all intents and purposes, impossible to create in the real world and yet which are critical
in distinguishing between hypotheses about the workings of the visual system. We shall
illustrate this with examples.
Before the results of experiments that use such ‘impossible’ stimuli can be considered, it is
vital to establish that immersive virtual reality can recreate the conditions of the real world
at least to the extent that performance on the task under investigation is similar to that in the
real world when the virtual scene is designed to mimic a real scene. Hence, the emphasis
on precise calibration that we have discussed here and on tests of performance in a variety
of tasks under conditions that simulate, in relevant respects, the real world. For example,

54 14
Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

we have shown in our experiments that walking blind to previously-displayed objects has a
similar accuracy to that in a real environment [26]; we have shown that biases in the judgment
of distance [25] and object size [6, 21] are small, as is the case under real-world conditions.
Having established that participants behave as expected under ‘normal’ conditions, the
implications of performance in manipulated environments should be taken seriously. The
expanding room demonstration from our laboratory is a good example. As participants walk
from one side of a virtual room to the other, the room expands by as much as fourfold but
participants fail to notice that anything odd has happened (see ﬁgure 6). They believe they
are in the same, static room and are amazed when told about the change in size. We have
demonstrated the room to well over 100 participants and only one or two experienced stereo
observers, who knew in advance about the phenomenon, reported being able to detect any
change in room size. How can this be? The trick, which is only possible in virtual reality, is
that the room expands about a point that is half way between the eyes (the ‘cyclopean point’
after the Cyclops, from Greek mythology, who had only one eye). What this means is that
as each object in the room gets further away it also gets larger in such a way that the image
(as seen by the cyclopean eye) remains the same. Given only the images that the cyclopean
eye receives, the expanding room is indistinguishable from a normal stable room. But two
cues that are usually thought of as providing reliable information about the 3D structure of
the world, binocular disparity and motion parallax, are still present and should be just as
effective at signalling the true size of the room as in a static room. We have investigated this
phenomenon in a number of experiments [6, 21, 24, 25]. The important point here is that the
isolation and manipulation of binocular disparity and motion parallax cues in this paradigm,
independent of other depth cues and while still allowing observers to explore an environment
freely, could not be achieved without virtual reality.
Another example from our laboratory shows how virtual reality can be used to test hypotheses
about the signals people use when they are interacting with moving objects. Footballers
running to head a ball could, in theory, compute the three-dimensional coordinate of football
relative to their head and calculate how to move in order to intercept it. This is not considered
a serious possibility in the neuroscience community; instead the argument in the literature is
about what type of simple visual parameters might be used as control variables in determining
how a player moves to intercept a ball. Many studies looking at players catching balls have
analysed the curved trajectories they make as they run and ﬁtted these using different models.
However, a key test is to manipulate the variables in question during the ﬂight of a ball and
measure the effect that this has on the player’s movement. We used virtual reality to do this
using experienced football players as participants. Although they did not report noticing any
difference between trials on which the ball travelled in a normal or manipulated trajectory,
there were clear differences between the movements of players in these two conditions which
could help discriminate between opposing hypotheses [16].
One heroic study by Wallach (1974) did not use virtual reality and serves as an illustration of
what can be done by building elaborate physical apparatus instead. Wallach was interested
in the mechanisms underlying visual stability. He arranged for a patterned ball to rotate
so that on some trials it faced the participant as they walked while on other trials it would
counter-rotate. The participant wore a headband that was attached via a series of pullies

to the ball, with a variable gearing affecting the ball’s rotation. Generating a very similar
stimulus in virtual reality, we were able to collect a signiﬁcantly larger set of data and show
that a static ball is reliably perceived as rotating away from them as they move (at least under
these conditions, where the participant knows that the ball’s rotation may be yolked to their
own movement) [26]. Instead of building more elaborate mechanical devices, virtual reality
allows the rotating-ball experiment to be extended to many different cases in which the visual
change of a given object caused by an observer’s movement (rotation, expansion, change in
slant) can be manipulated independently from other features of the image (such as those that
deﬁne the location of the object with respect to others in the scene). Such a systematic and
comprehensive study of the parameters of visual stability has yet to be carried out, but it
seems unlikely that it could be done in freely moving observers without using immersive
virtual reality.

4. Future challenges
4.1. See-through augmented reality and eye tracking
We brieﬂy touched upon augmented reality (AR) at the start of the chapter, and return to
it here due to the inevitable fusion of AR and VR that is likely to take place as display
technologies advance. With see-though OLED panels in early stages of development, it is
likely that a “one-size-ﬁts-all” HMD design will emerge which would be suitable for both AR
(in see-though mode) and VR (in some form of black-out mode). Yet, an enduring problem
with see-through HMD’s is their inability to obscure rays from the real world. Creating truly
opaque virtual objects is beyond current display technology.
However, such an HMD will present a new challenge which has not been met with existing
video-based AR headsets, or conventional (non-see-through) VR HMDs. The challenge is that
when the observer changes gaze direction, the eye does not rotate around its optic centre,
but around some other point which will shift the optic centre. Thus, any static calibration
(such as that obtained from our method described above) will fail to align virtual objects
with their real-world counterpart. The misalignment will be worse for more extreme gaze
angles. A possible solution would be to use a miniature, passive eye tracking system mounted
within the HMD to track the gaze direction, report this to the graphics generating computer,
which will modify the graphics frustums accordingly. Whether this can be done rapidly and
unobtrusively remains to be seen.

4.2. High-resolution foveal rendering
While we wait for technology to catch up with our idealized VR system, and deliver the rich,
high resolution scenes necessary to truly virtualize the real-world, there are ways in which
the VR experience could be improved, for example using selective rendering. The human
eye’s fovea has a much higher spatial sensitivity than peripheral vision and, hence, rendering
a high-detailed scene in regions of the HMD display that project to the eye’s periphery is a
waste of computational resources. Instead, eye tracking technology like that described above
could be used to render a small, highly detailed sub region of the scene where the observer
is ﬁxating. The remainder of the display would comprise a low resolution rendering of the
scene, which to peripheral vision is indistinguishable from highly detailed rendering. This
type of technique has been used in reading research for many years [14].

5. Conclusions
Virtual reality is likely to have an increasingly pervasive inﬂuence on our lives in the future,
driven in part by progressive advances in the realism of computer graphics and the ability,
through augmented reality technology, to mix real and virtual objects seamlessly in the visual
scene. Virtual reality technology still falls short of a full and accurate re-creation of the spatial,
temporal and spectral properties of the rays arriving at the eye as an observer explores a
real-world scene but, as we have discussed, great progress has been made towards this
goal. Finally, we have emphasised the unique possibilities opened up by virtual reality for
investigating the mechanisms of human vision and how, in this case, a rapid and faithful
reproduction of the rays arriving at each eye is particularly important.

1. Introduction
With the aggravation of the population aging in the world, more and more nations and
communities attach importance to the research on the rehabilitation of the aging and the
disabled. Nevertheless, the conventional rehabilitation apparatus dramatically have a
number of problems, regardless of their good rehabilitation effects. For instance, the
conventional training techniques require enormous physical therapists such as doctors,
nurses and so forth to assist the patients in completing a series of activities, so that it would
waste a lot of unnecessary expense and manpower. As a result, there is an increasing
emphasis placed on the rehabilitation robot which may be a solution to the problems in
conventional rehabilitation technique.
Some research job is about the lower-limb, and the researchers have designed many
practical devices. Y. H. Tsoi and S. Q. Xie (2008) have invented a robot which could recover
the patients’ ankles. However, the training environment might be boring for most patients,
for it lacks of a virtual game interface which may be full of entertainments. Meanwhile,
there are also a lot of researchers who pay attention to the upper-limb rehabilitation robot.
Koichi Kirihara, Norihiko Saga and Naoki Saito (2010) have designed a robot which has five
degrees of freedom by virtue of its link mechanism. A pneumatic cylinder, arranged and
integrated with the device, was used to operate it. Nonetheless, the safety could not be
assured in this device, for the control of the pneumatic device often brings about fierce
impulse which may do harm to the patients. Janez Podobnik, Matjaž Mihelj and Marko
Munih (2009) also have made a HenRiE (Haptic environment for reaching and grasping
exercises) device with two hemiparetic subjects. The HenRiE device is intended for use in a
robot-aided neurorehabilitation for training of reaching and grasping in haptic
environments. But the researchers fail to add an impedance environment to the patients
who are being trained so that the patients’ arm muscles could not be fully stimulated.

62 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

Ken’ichi Koyanagi, Junji Furusho, Ushio Ryut (2003) and Akio Inoue, T Kikuchi, K
Fukushima, J Furusho and T Ozawa (2009) have developed a practical haptic device
‘PLEMO-P1’，in which adopts ER brakes as its force generators. Although, by using the ER
brakes, it is safer and more convenient than other similar rehabilitation robots, the ER
brakes still have some disadvantages such as the leakage of the inner liquid.
This chapter mainly gives a description of a new upper-limb rehabilitation robot using the
magnetic particle brake (MPB), which is named RRR-I (Remote Rehabilitation Robot-I). The
robot is shown in Fig.1. After the passive training technique in the rehabilitation field is
applied to the design of the robot, the MPB is made full use of to generate an impedance
environment for the patients. Furthermore, in order to make the training process more
interesting and more attractive, a kind of virtual reality technique is put into training
process. For example, a human-machine interaction interface is devised, so that the patients
could play some particular computer games to enhance their arms’ movement ability and
then the researchers could assess their rehabilitation level. Finally, by using some correlative
mathematical statistics methods, we create a kind of evaluation technique and basically
obtain a good result.

2. The PNF technology in upper limb rehabilitation
PNF (proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation) is a therapy which promotes the response
ability of nerve and muscle through simulating proprioceptors. PNF was founded by
Herman Kabat who was American physician and neurophysiologist in 1940s. It was
originally used in cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis patients, medical practice has proof
that it also can apply to the stroke upper limb rehabilitation (2008).

A Novel Rehabilitation Evaluation Method on Virtual Reality Based on RRR-I 63

According to common movement mode of human daily activities, PNF technology was
founded based on the human body development learning and neurophysiology principle.
One of the most commonly used PNF technology is diagonal mode (diagonal D), which is a
kind of gross motor that can be seen in most function activities. It is the movement that
formed by the interaction of three muscle in flexionandextension, internal and external
exhibition, internal and external spin. Also diagonal mode is the last and highest form of
normal development. All the diagonal movement is the merger of rotating component,
which can promote the interaction of both left and right body sides because of the path
across the body centre line. Common action: right hand touching left ear, resisted motion.
The resisted motion was shown in Fig. 2.

Figure 2. Resisted motion

Command:

A short and concise command can stimulate patients to active force;
2.

Visual cues:

Make patients take exercises by watching in order to help to exercising and coordinating;
3.

The body location of therapists:

The therapists should be close to patients and move stable together with patients while
providing resistance through their own weight;
4.

Input of ontology sense:

According to the situation of patients, the resistance on the patients’ sicken limbs should be
suitable. The resistance will be ok while it allowing patients to do slow, stable and
coordinated movement with no abnormal movement occurring.

64 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

3. Design of RRR-I
Fig. 3 shows the structure of the RRR-I. The robot mainly consists of robot arms, a handle,
two balance blocks, a screen, a connection box, a computer box, a controller box and other
parts. By referring to the Parallelogram Linkage Mechanism (PLM), we design the robotic
arms which have balance blocks to keep the arm’s balance. The absolute encoders are fixed
in the connection box as well as the MPBs. But they have distinct functions. The encoders
are used to attain the arms’ rotation angles while the MPBs are applied to the resistance
moment support. In order to control the pitching angle of the robot, which may change
according to different patients, we make an attempt to design a rotation handle at the
surface of the connection box. Meanwhile, the force of gripping is obtained through a force
sensor on the handle. And the DSP in the controller box would receive the sensors’ data
information and then send the control information to the MPBs after a data analysis. In the
end, a game interface would be displayed to the patients in the screen.

Figure 3. Overall Structure of the RRR-I

3.1. Upper limb rehabilitation robot system
The upper limb rehabilitation robot system and diagram of the whole robot system were
respectively shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5. The hardware consisted of three parts: control unit,
detect unit and execution unit.

3.2. Control unit
The micro control chip was one 32-bit fixed-point DSP TMS320F2812 made by TI, in charge
of the control calculation of force feedback system, handle position and communication with
PC; PC was responsible for the human-computer interaction.

A Novel Rehabilitation Evaluation Method on Virtual Reality Based on RRR-I 65

3.3. Detection unit
Detection unit consisted of position detection and force detection.
The handle was a force sensor which can sense force in four directions and measure the
force to limb. Because of the low moving speed of sicken limb, AD7705 with low working
frequency was choose as A/D conversion chip. AD7705 can receive the weak signal directly
came from sensors. Thus, error caused by the analog signal amplifier circuit can be avoided
and the circuit was greatly simplified;
As the position detect unit, 14-bit accuracy absolute encoder ensured the movement tracking
precision of patients’ upper limb.

Figure 4. Upper limb rehabilitation robot based on magnetic powder brakes

66 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

Figure 5. Diagram of upper limb rehabilitation robot system structure

3.4. Execution unit
As actuators, two magnetic powder brakes were responsible for the generation of resistance
of 2 DOF. Two magnetic powder brakes were respectively linked to the inner and outer
shaft through belt, so as to realize independent torque control of the inner and outer shaft of
2 DOF, as shown in Fig. 6.
Based on the principle of electromagnetic, magnetic powder brakes convey torque through
magnetic powder, where relationship between torque and exciting current is linearity. So
the torque can be easily controlled by changing exciting current. Normally, the relationship
between exciting current and the conveyed torque is proportion linearity (2009) in the range
of 5% to 100% of rated torque.

Figure 6. Braking force diagram of 2 DOF

A Novel Rehabilitation Evaluation Method on Virtual Reality Based on RRR-I 67

When exciting current remain unchanged, the conveyed torque wouldn’t be influenced by
the differential speed between master driver and follower (sliding speed), i.e. there is no
difference between static torque and dynamic torque (2004), so the constant torque can be
stably conveyed. Then magnetic powder brakes only generate resistance torque result from
its fixed follower. Magnetic powder brakes parameters were shown in table 1. Because of the
feature above used in the handle force control, the required force to sicken limb can be
achieved simply and effectively.

3.5. Software
In this chapter, the man-machine interface of whole upper limb rehabilitation robot was
realized by Visual C++. The interface consisted of virtual mechanical arm display and basic
information display.
1.

Virtual mechanical arm

This section displayed the real-time virtual mechanical arm, which gave patients more
intuitive feelings. At the same time, path strategies, resistance strategies and command
stimulating strategies were set in this section according to different mode, which would be
mainly introduced in next chapter.
2.

Basic information

This section recorded and displayed some information, e.g. running time, rehabilitation
level, rehabilitation status and rehabilitation period, which would be the basis for doctor’s
diagnosis and rehabilitation plan.

4. Transformation of coordinate
Because the coordinate in the virtual reality has to be associated with the coordinate in the
reality and the data obtained from the absolute encoders is just about the arms’ angles, it is
crucial for us to make a coordinate transformation in order to make an easier analysis on the
arms’ movement.
At first, it is necessary to set a coordinate system for the robot arms in the reality. Referring
to the paper of Chieh-Li Chen, Tung-Chin Wu and Chao-Chung Peng (2011), we set the 2D
rectangular coordinate system showed in Fig. 7.

68 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

Figure 7. The Rectangle Coordinate System in which the Robot Arms Move

Since the arms’ lengths in the virtual reality are not required to equal to the ones in the
reality, it is assumed that the arms’ lengths are all equal. It means
 ൌ  ൌ  ൌ  ൌ  ൌ 

(1)

Furthermore, in order to attain the coordinate figure of the handle (point D), we have to
transfer the angle data got from the encoders to the position data in the XOY coordinate.
However, because the range of the data from the encoder is from 0 degree to 360 degree and
the positions of the 0 degree lines from two encoders are more likely to be different, it is a
little complicated for us to deduce all situations. Thus, we initially consider only one
situation showed in Fig. 8.

Figure 8. Coordinate transformation graph. OG and OH are the 0 degree lines from two encoders, OA,
OB, BC and ACD are the robot arms.

A Novel Rehabilitation Evaluation Method on Virtual Reality Based on RRR-I 69

According to Fig. 8, obviously, the position of D is:
� � O� � O� ∙ ��s� � � ∙ ��s�

Because the angle from the encoder is only measured clockwise, in Fig. 8, � � � � � � � ,

After analyze other situations, we eventually conclude that (4), (5), (6) are the same while (3)

5. Strategies of upper limb rehabilitation

According to the introduction of PNF technology in the second section, some strategies of
upper limb rehabilitation were presented. These strategies are just designed in ordinary
frames and the detailed proposal will be described in the section 6.

5.1. Path strategies
In order to imitate diagonal movement form, such as resisted motion and right hand
touching left ear, movement path of parallel lines and vertical lines was set. Before
setting path, firstly, the current movement range of the patients’ upper limb would be
testing.
Push the handle to the foremost point;
Push the handle to the far left point;
Push the handle to the far right point.
The reachable zone of current sicken limb would be obtained through these three points
above. The right upper limb movement path was shown in Fig. 9, which mainly consisted of
horizontal lines. Three black points in Fig. 9 respectively represented the foremost point, the
far left point and the far right point, which formed a triangle zone where patients’ sicken
limb can move safely. In Fig. 9, the solid line was specified path and the black dotted line in
the middle was body center line.
The movement above was just in plane. Therefore, for the purpose of expanding the range
of rehabilitation movement, the angle of pitch of pedestal can be changed through the
regulating handle, as well as adjusting seat, so that patients had a relatively comfortable
initial position, as shown in Fig. 10.

A Novel Rehabilitation Evaluation Method on Virtual Reality Based on RRR-I 71

Figure 9. Schematic of right upper limb specified path

Figure 10. Rehabilitation robot under different angles of pitch

5.2. Resistance strategies
Resistance control was divided into two periods: basic period and improve period.
Basic period: the closer to the specified path, the smaller resistance was. This method can
guide patients do movement along the specified path. The period should be changed into
the improve period when the movement accuracy of patients’ sicken limb was improved.
Improve period: the closer to the specified path, the bigger resistance was. This method can
make patients do movement along the specified path more difficult, so as to further improve
the flexibility and motion precision of patients’ sicken limb.

72 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

A healthy people was made do the same path respectively in basic period and improve
period, the result was shown in Fig. 11 and Fig. 12. The dotted line of two figures
represented specified path. From these two curves of actual movement, we can see that the
difficulty of tracking was bigger in improve period compared with basic period.

5.3. Command stimulating strategies
In the PNF promote method, command whose effect was important can stimulate patients
to active force, also can give them encouragement and care.
When patients completed a movement in process, some suitable encouragements and
praises can be given in speech way.
When the patients’ sicken limb stopped moving in process, some encouragements should be
given, e.g. “come on”, “force”, “you can do it”.
When patients completed the whole process, some praises should be given, e.g. “very
good”, “such rapid process”, “well done”.

A Novel Rehabilitation Evaluation Method on Virtual Reality Based on RRR-I 73

6. Medical training design and data analysis based on virtual reality
In this section, a medical training game, which is originated from the design in the section 5,
will be presented. And, a novel data processing method will be introduced. All designs are
based on a virtual game.

6.1. Virtual rehabilitation game design
According to the strategies presented in section 5, a game based on the virtual reality is
designed, as showed in Fig. 13(a). The patient would hold the handle on the robot arm and
move his or her hand along the trajectory in Fig. 13(a) in the virtual game. The trajectory is
designed to move across human midline. It means the hand would move from the right of
the human body to the left and then repeat circle again. Meanwhile, referring to the
resistance therapy, we would apply three different resistance forces in trajectory OA, AB
and BC to the patient’s hand. Besides, F�� � F�� � F�� .

Figure 13. Virtual game’s coordinate transformation graphs. The XOY coordinate system will move
along the trajectory in (a), so it seems that the OABC rope is straightened to OX axis direction. (c) is
obtained after the X axis in (b) is transferred to the time axis.

6.2. Data analysis method
In Fig. 13(b), the sample observation data ���� , y�� �, ���� , y�� �, … , ���� , y�� �will be obtained
according to the correlative observation time t� , t � , … , t � . If the horizontal axis is changed to
the time axis, a new coordinate system showed in Fig. 13(c) would be set up. Then the
sample observation data would become �t� , y� �, �t � , y� �, … , �t � , y� �. Referring to the book
written by Cook, R. Dennis (1998) and the book written by Irwin Miller, Marylees Miller
(2004), it is appropriate to apply a variance function σ� to the rehabilitation evaluation.

Because the evaluation goal is to judge whether the trajectory of the patient’s hand is the
same with the expected one, we assume y� � �. Then
�

�

σ� � ���y � y��� � � � ∑�����y� � y��� � � ∑���� y��

(18)

74 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

Considering that σ� may be zero and the time is a vital factor, we improve (18) to (19).
χ � �1 � σ� �t

Here the unit of the t is millisecond.

(19)

As a result of three different resistance forces, the variances and improved variances in OA,
AB and BC should be calculated respectively. Then we obtain χ�� , χ�� and χ�� .

Based on the AHP method by Lan Gan, Xuehu Wang, Rong Li (2009) and the importance of
the three trajectories, we construct the judge matrix:

� � ���� ����
To solve the characteristic roots in (21)

We attain that λ��� � 3����2

1 1�2 1�3
� �2 1 1� �

3 2

�� � λ��� I�ω � �

(20)

(21)

And

�� I �

���� ��
���

� ������

�� I � ����

�� � �

���

���

� ������

(22)
(23)
(24)

Because the random consistency ratio �� � � ��1�, judge matrix will get a satisfactory
consistency. Then value of ω would be got:
ω � �ω�� , ω�� , ω�� �� � ���1�3�,��2���,���3����

(25)

γ � ω�� ∙ χ�� � ω�� ∙ χ�� � ω�� ∙ χ��

(26)

Therefore, finally, we define a rehabilitation evaluation function γ :

Theoretically, according to the properties of the time and variance, the same patient would
become better, if the value of γ becomes smaller.

6.3. Experiment and results analysis

Through using Visual C++ and OpenGL, we eventually design a shovelboard 3D game
interface showed in Fig. 14. The patient would move the robot handle of the RRR-I along the
trajectory in the game. Meanwhile, the patient would feel resistance forces which are
different in different area in the game. Moreover, the timer starts to record when the ball
begins at the start line and ends in the finish line.

A Novel Rehabilitation Evaluation Method on Virtual Reality Based on RRR-I 75

Figure 14. Shovelboard 3D game interface

Figure 15. Shovelboard curve analysis graph.

76 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

After a healthy individual plays this 3D game by using the RRR-I, a curve such as the one in
Fig. 13(c) would be measured and then displayed. And the parameters such as OA ,  AB ,
 BC and  would be calculated and then showed. Although the proportions of the resistance
forces in the three different areas always remain unchanged, the size of the forces under the
circumstance showed in Fig. 15(b), it is three times larger than the one showed in Fig. 15(a).
In comparison with the two different curves and parameters’ values in Fig. 15(a) and Fig.
15(b), it is obvious that, in Fig. 15(b), the values of every parameter become bigger.
Meanwhile, the length of the time in every area also changes longer. It means the
individual would spend more time to complete this game. Besides, the fluctuation of the
curve in Fig. 15(b) is evidently fiercer. It means the movement of the individual’s hand
becomes harder. In a word, we could observe the changes by checking the variation of the
value of every parameter.

7. Conclusion
In this chapter we realized an upper-limb rehabilitation robot named RRR-I and a new
virtual 3D game used to recover patients. A new variance method and the AHP method are
applied to the analysis on the rehabilitation level of the 3D game. Through an experiment on
a healthy individual, a good consequence is obtained. In the future, the patients should be
invited to participate in this experiment so that the effects of the RRR-I and other research
could be proved more convincible. Besides, some new rehabilitation methods would be
applied to the training on the patients.

Virtual Reality to Simulate Adaptive Walking in
Unstructured Terrains for Multi-Legged Robots

1. Introduction
Walking robots posses capabilities to perform adaptive locomotion and motion planning
over unstructured terrains and therefore are in the focus of high interest to the researchers
all over the world. However, true adaptive locomotion in difficult terrains involves various
problems such as foot-planning, path-planning, gait dynamic stability and autonomous
navigation in the presence of external disturbances [1]. There is a large volume of research
work that is dedicated to the development of walking robots that exhibit biologically
inspired locomotion. In this context, an insect-sized flying robot [2], an ape-like robot [3], an
amphibious snake-like robot ACM-R5 [4], for-legged robots like Big Dog and Little Dog, an
ant-inspired robot ANTON [5] and LAURON [6], are some well-known examples of biomimetic robots. A related study [7] describes an implementation of a neurobiological leg
control system on a hexapod robot for improving the navigation of the robot over uneven
terrains.
However, the crucial problem that the general approaches suffer is the challenging task of
achieving accurate transition between different gaits while maintaining stable locomotion in
the presence of external disturbances [1]. In natural rough terrains, prior knowledge of the
terrain information is not always available therefore, this chapter aims to make use of virtual
reality technology to inspect adaptive locomotion over unknown irregular terrains for
possible improvement in gait mobility and stability in the presence of unexpected
disturbances.
In order to evaluate and inspect the dynamic characteristics of an adaptive locomotion over
an unstructured terrain, it is difficult and time consuming to conduct real-world
experiments often. Therefore, virtual prototyping technology serves a prime role that results
in better design optimization and allows inspection and evaluation of the mathematical
models specifically those which are complicated or impractical to estimate using real

prototypes in real-world [16-18]. Virtual Reality Technology provides a rapid method of
validating several characteristics of a mathematical model using dynamic simulations for
the identification of potential errors in early design stages [8]. Possible defects can be
identified and removed by modifying the simulation model itself which is less time
consuming and practical if to be performed often. Thus, the complete control algorithm can
be analyzed using the simulation model [8].
The chapter is structured as follows: second section describes the mathematical modelling of
a hexapod robot using kinematics and dynamics equations. In the third section, gait
generation is described for planning cyclic wave and ripple gaits. Fourth section is
dedicated to the gait analysis over flat and uneven terrains. Finally, the chapter draws
conclusion on the significance of using a simulation-based approach for rapid-prototyping
of gait generation methods in multi-legged robots.

2. Mathematical modeling and design
The studies conducted in [8] & [9] use SimMechanics software to construct a simulationbased model of a six-legged robot which comprises of several subsystems interconnected to
each other as described in Fig. 1. The physical robot is represented using a subsystem
known as “plant”. Another subsystem which represents the kinematic engine contains the
forward and reverse kinematics of the robot. Other subsystems include a gait generation
block and an environment sensing block as shown in Fig. 1. The aforesaid subsystems are
further described in the following subsections.

subassemblies. Each leg attached to the main body is considered as a 3-degree of freedom
serial manipulator which acts as the actuating element in the overall simulation model.
Furthermore, the block diagram shows joints to describe appropriate connections between
the rigid bodies which provide an opportunity for actuation and sensing. Fig. 3 & Fig. 4
show the respective subsystems of a hexapod robot as investigated in [8, 9].

2.2. Kinematics engine
The kinematic model of the robot reported here uses forward and inverse kinematic
equations of a 3-DOF serial manipulator to control the foothold in 3D-space. The research
studies [8 - 14] describe the mathematical modelling of a 3-DOF leg in 3D space in terms of a
forward kinematic model. The details are given in the following subsections.

2.2.1. Forward kinematics
Each leg is modelled as a 3-DOF serial manipulator comprised of three members as: coxa,
femur and tibia inter-related using pin joints. The joint connecting the body with the coxa
(BodyCoxa-joint) is represented by �� , the joint connecting coxa with the femur
(CoxaFemur-joint) is represented by �� , and the joint connecting the femur with the tibia
(FemurTibia-joint) is represented by �� . The position of the foothold [���������� with respect
to BodyCoxa-joint motion axis is obtained using Denavit Hartenberg convention and
expressed as a general homogenous transformation expression as given by (1). Table1 enlists
the D-H parameters of the robot leg shown in Fig.5.

3. Gait generation

Gait generation is the main topic of investigation in the field of legged locomotion. Mobility
and stability are two important factors which require specific attention while planning a gait
for locomotion in natural environments. Generally, the gaits found in nature feature sequential

prototype robot over a smooth flat surface.

Virtual Reality to Simulate Adaptive Walking in Unstructured Terrains for Multi-Legged Robots 91

motion of legs and the body. A large volume of work [5-14] deals with biologicallyinspired gaits to replicate this sequential motion pattern found in insects into real
robots. The gaits investigated here are cyclic periodic continuous gaits (wave gait &
ripple gait) as investigated in [10 & 12]. Gait generation occurs in the gait planner
shown in Fig. 1, where commanded foothold locations and orientations are combined
with gait sequences to generate a sequential pattern of footholds in 3D-space. The
computed leg-sequential pattern is submitted to the inverse kinematic model to
determine appropriate joint angles to achieve the desired location. The motion of each
leg is determined by the mathematical model. The sequential patterns of leg-lifts for a
12-step ripple gait and a 19-step wave gait are shown in Fig. 16 while, Fig. 6 shows a
pictorial demonstration of the gait generation in simulation model and the actual
prototype robot over a smooth flat surface.
SimMechanics provides a diverse library of software sensors to obtain information from
the environment. These sensors mainly include rigid-body sensors and joint sensors. As
shown in the figure, the sensors subsystem outlines a network of sensors employed at
each leg and their respective joints. Sensors attached to the legs are used to obtain the
absolute location and orientation of each foothold in 3D-space while the joint sensors
provide information about each joint’s linear and angular rates and accelerations. This
sensory network acquires the information from each sensor, filters the data to reject noise.
Motion planner, uses the feedback to compute corrections between the commanded data
and the recorded data. A Butterworth high-pass 6th order digital filter is used to filter the
sensor noise.

4. Dynamic simulations
The objective of carrying out dynamic simulations is to test the validity of the mathematical
model and perform gait analysis over uneven terrains. In order to realize the first objective,
the mathematical model is simulated first in forward dynamics mode and then in inverse
dynamics mode. The robot is commanded to walk between two fixed points 2 meters apart.
Straight line walking is achieved with an attitude control using GPS and Compass sensors
feedback. Fig. 7 show respective views of robot straight-line walking achieved over flat
surfaces using Microsoft Robotics Studio [15].

4.1. Test 1 – Forward dynamics mode
In forward dynamics mode, the objective is to analyze the torques produced at the joints
provided each joint is actuated with a motion profile consisting of joint rotation, velocity
and acceleration. The robot is steered with a periodic cyclic gait. The footholds planned
by the gait generator are passed to the kinematics engine and appropriate joint angles
are computed in return. The obtained joint angle profile of each joint is differentiated
to compute joint rates and accelerations. Finally, the computed joint motion profiles are fed
to the joint actuators to simulate the motion. Joint sensors are used to record the actual

the simulation and those determined by the dynamic model are plotted as shown by Fig.

study the errors. The comparative representation of actual motion data and desired data is

confirms the validity of inverse model for walking over flat surfaces.

4.3. Test 3 – Gait analysis over an uneven terrain
The objective of this test is to conduct a gait analysis in terms of robot speed, joint reaction
torques and reaction forces at the foothold during robot-environment interactions.

4.3.1. Reaction forces at the foothold and reaction torques at the joints
In order to study an adaptive gait over an uneven terrain, we must first describe the joint
reaction torques due to the reaction forces which arise at the footholds during the leg-terrain
interactions.

4.3.2. Gait analysis over an uneven terrain
The uneven terrain as shown in Fig. 13 is modelled in Microsoft Robotics Developer Studio.
A terrain is modelled with random regions of depression and elevation so that the gait can
be analyzed under the influence of unexpected disturbances. The robot is steered between
defined waypoints and the joints torques are investigated with different gait patterns. Fig.
12(A) shows a comparative representation of torques computed by our mathematical model
and those obtained through joint sensors provided by the simulation engine. The results
shown in Fig. 12 are those obtained when the robot was steered with a fast-speed ripple gait.
As evident from the forces plot shown in Fig. 12(B), friction force is close to the normal
reaction point at some points and exceeds the normal reaction force at some other points
which signifies that the robot experienced significant degrees of slip/drift which walking

through those regions of the terrain. As a consequence, the mathematical model failed to
determine adequate torques at the joints to counter the drift each foothold is experiencing
while the locomotion. Therefore, the fast-speed ripple gait was found inefficient over an
unexpected terrain due to the non-uniform distribution of payload about the two sides of
the robot body in its support pattern.

In the second run, the robot was steered with a slow-speed wave gait in which each leg is
lifted whereas the remaining supports the body. This confirms an even sharing of payload
on either side of the robot. The results of this simulation run are shown in Fig. 14 and Fig.
15. As evident from the Fig. 15(B) that the friction force data never exceeds the normal
reaction force which confirms that the robot never experienced a slip/drift over the same
track when using the wave gait. As a consequence, close matching of computed torques
and the sensed torques during this simulation run as shown by Fig. 15(A) signifies the
validity of our proposed mathematical model to realize adaptive walking over uneven
terrains at slow speeds. Additional simulation results are exhibited in Fig. 14 which
portrays the track of the centre of gravity of the robot and its speed profile. Fig. 15(C) &
Fig. 15(D) show the profiles of body rotation angles and rates about x, y & z-axes. As
evident from the Fig. 15(C), the roll and pith rotations of the body are minimal which
confirms the validity of our attitude control for maintaining the body flat over an
unknown irregular terrain.

5. Conclusions
This chapter outlines a study on signifying the importance of employing virtual reality
technology in realizing legged locomotion over unknown irregular terrains. The objective is
to emphasize that how virtual reality technology can serve a prime role in the improvement
of legged locomotion by performing gait analysis over unstructured terrains which is often
time intense and complex to conduct in real-worlds. The objective has been achieved by
analyzing an adaptive gait of a six-legged hexapod robot with two unique support patterns
namely: ripple and wave. A complete mathematical model of the robot is presented at the
start of the chapter to equip the reader with the basic knowledge of forward and reverse
kinematic equations used in robot kinematics. Robot dynamics is further described with a
computed-torque control technique to incorporate the forces and moments at the feet. To
validate the proposed mathematical model, simulation tests are first carried out in a
constraint simulation environment using SimMechanics and results of mathematical model
are compared with those obtained from on-board sensors. For gait analysis, the robot is
steered over an unknown irregular terrain first using a fast-speed ripple gait and then using
a slow-speed wave gait. Reaction forces at the footholds and the reaction torques about the
joint motion axes in a leg are investigated which reveal that the wave gait is slow but more
secure for adaptive locomotion over an unknown irregular terrain. This even sharing of
active payload on either side of the robot body in wave gait results in greater stability
especially in the regions of possible slip/drift. However, when using a fast speed ripple gait
in which the force-distribution on either side of the robot body is not uniform, the support
pattern fails to provide enough friction force against the normal reaction force that may
prevent the slip/drift. As a consequence, ripple gaits provide high mobility and are effective
over flat terrains however, wave gaits are more suited to walking over unknown irregular
terrains.

1. Introduction
The product development process (PDP) generally involves a sequence of gathering
requirements, conceptual design, engineering, manufacturing and finally a market release.
Successful product development depends on collaboration and communication between
stakeholders (e.g. designers and engineers, but also end-users, marketeers or managers)
throughout the phases in the development process. Tools that support this communication
and collaboration primarily focus on internal communication. For instance, sketches and
drawings facilitate communication between designers, CAD models facilitate
communication between engineers and presentations or reports are used for communication
between departments. Supporting external communication (i.e. communication between
people inside the development process and people outside the process) is more challenging
because external stakeholders (such as end-users or customers) are usually not trained in
being involved in a PDP.
This chapter describes how Virtual Reality (VR) can facilitate the involvement of external
stakeholders in the PDP. Stakeholder involvement can improve the information quality and
quantity; end-user feedback for instance facilitates concept generation and selection, or
identifies usability issues in an early stage. However, with only limited design information
available it is difficult to provide stakeholders with a clear presentation of a product concept
and future use context. We therefore propose to use VR technologies to create realistic
concept representations in the early stages of the design process. VR technologies create an
alternative reality in which worlds, objects and characters can be experienced that may not
yet be available in reality. As such it allows stakeholders to not only see the future product
(which could also be achieved with a concept sketch or mockup), but also experience the
product and the interactions with its use context.

106 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

In this chapter we first elaborate on stakeholder involvement in the PDP, and highlight
the importance of involving future end-users in particular. We also depict some of the
characteristics that make VR suitable for facilitating stakeholder involvement. The main
body of the chapter comprises a set of industrial case studies that illustrate how VR can
be applied to achieve different levels of user engagement in various phases of the PDP.
This overview and comparison of case studies leads to conclusions regarding the
selection of appropriate VR techniques for specific types of user involvement in product
design.

2. Background
Traditionally, the PDP is referred to as a problem solving activity in which the result is
determined by a series of technical decisions [1, 2]. Recently, the product design process is
more and more considered to be a group activity in which communication and collaboration
between stakeholders plays a central role [3,4].
The importance of including these stakeholders, and in particular potential users, in the
design process becomes clear when one considers the task-artefact cycle [5]. New products
are designed to fulfill a certain task or activity, i.e. solve the signaled problem. However, the
introduction of the new product will in return influence the identified problem. New
problems may arise as well as new opportunities may be identified. As [6] explains: ‘Design
is always indeterminate, because design changes the world within which people act and
experience’ (p. 48). To support a continuous iterative design approach, a close and timely
involvement of end-users in the design process is therefore required.

2.1. Facilitating user involvement
To successfully include end-users, a design process needs to have appropriate facilitating
characteristics. In [7] the following set of conditions for effective and efficient participation
of end-users is proposed.






A direct and explicit communication between designer and end-user needs to be
established. The way of communication should minimise the chance of
misinterpretation on either side.
End-users should be enabled to have a realistic interaction with the design information.
They should be able to reliably assess the exact functioning and experience of the
design under a wide range of circumstances.
End-users should be enabled to reliably become conscious of and assess the
consequences of design decisions. Consequences of design decisions should be made
explicit and presented in a manner that is comprehensible regardless participant’s
training or discipline.

VR potentially provides solutions meeting all three conditions for successful user
involvement. It supports a realistic interaction with design information: design
information is presented in a way that is comprehensible regardless discipline or

Facilitating User Involvement in Product Design Through Virtual Reality 107

training, whereas consequences of design choices can be experienced rather than
imagined [8]. The latter is especially beneficial when stakeholders (e.g. end-users) are
unfamiliar with the product to be designed or with the technology that is suggested to be
incorporated. The actual experience of design information and consequences will sincerely
improve the reliability of the input provided by stakeholders to the design process.
Furthermore, by using VR simulation, misunderstandings between human actors are less
likely to occur compared to when using more abstract or symbolic representations of
design information (such as natural language, sketches and CAD drawings). Another
benefit of using VR simulation is that it eliminates the necessity to make physical
prototypes. It not only saves money and time, but also allows for evaluation of candidate
designs in an earlier phase of the design process [9]. Evaluation of candidate designs
under dangerous or rare use circumstances is furthermore supported without
compromising safety or efficiency.
While VR in principle meets all the proposed conditions, it is argued that VR is rarely a
solution on its own. Integrating VR technologies with the PDP requires supporting
principles to 'embed' the technology in the design process. In our case studies we primarily
make use of scenarios and gaming techniques to do so.
Scenarios are explicit descriptions of hypothetical events concerning a product during a
certain phase of its life cycle [10]. A scenario can be expressed by displaying a prototype
(either real or virtual) in an environment (either real or virtual). Within design processes,
scenarios are used to address problems, needs, constraints and possibilities. Like VR, the use
of scenarios facilitates explicit communication of design information among involved
stakeholders.
Gaming is generally described as a play with props following specific rules and often with
an element of competition between players and decided by chance, strength, skill or a
combination of these [11]. Within design, playing games is a way to generate ideas in a
situated and participative way. Due to rapid developments in the gaming industry, the
trend to use games as a design tool no longer means just board games and card games, but
also computer games. Within a (computer) game, information is simultaneously generated,
represented and evaluated. Therefore, design iterations can be performed very quickly.
Furthermore, playing games helps to develop a common language between designers and
users [12].
The majority of the case studies presented in this chapter use scenarios that were explicitly
defined to serve as a frame of reference, whereas gaming techniques were added to trigger
user participation.

3. Framework
This section introduces the framework through which the VR applications are presented
and compared. The framework is based on the work of [13], who presents an overview of
user involvement in product design methods. Each of our case studies will be positioned

108 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

according to two dimensions, namely the design phase in which it is used and the intended
level of user engagement.
The first dimension of the proposed framework represents the phase in the design process
in which VR is applied. VR applications in product development (e.g. virtual prototyping,
virtual assembly or virtual manufacturing) traditionally rely on CAD systems and
consequently focus on advanced stages of the PDP, such as the engineering and
manufacturing phase [14] for a survey). In this chapter however, we focus on the early
stages (also known as the fuzzy front-end) of the PDP. The lack of concrete information in
this stage of the PDP is challenging for designers, but also allows end-users to still have
considerable impact on design decisions. The case studies will illustrate how the benefits of
VR mentioned in the previous section facilitate various design activities in these early
stages. To further characterise the case studies, the first two phases of the original
framework (specification and conceptual design) are split into a specification phase, a
concept generation phase and a concept evaluation phase. This allows for a differentiation
between generative and evaluation applications that take place in the concept development
phase.
The second dimension that is used to characterise the case studies is defined as the level
of user engagement. User engagement is related to the extent to which a user is involved
or participating in the design process. Interviews and surveys require a low level of
user engagement, as the actual product development is on on behalf of the users
(referred to as 'design for' in the original framework). A higher level of user
engagement is achieved when users are allowed to try, evaluate and/or select proposed
product concepts. This is referred to as 'design with' in the original framework. The
highest level of user engagement is achieved through co-design activities, in which
users actually generate product concepts themselves. This is referred to as 'design by' in
the original framework.
Both dimensions have a continuous scale, meaning that there is no strict border between
phases in the design process or level of stakeholder involvement. Some of the cases we
present comprise an integrated design approach that spans the entire product development
process, while other cases focus on a particular phase in the process.

4. Case studies
The case studies presented in this section originate from various research projects in which
industrial partners participate by providing a design case. Consequently, there is a wide
variety in application domains, ranging from automotive design and consumer electronics to
healthcare and mechanical engineering. Furthermore, the industrial partners range from
large multinationals to small or medium sized enterprises (SMEs). The involved industrial
partners only had experience in the application of VR in the later design stages. Main reason
was the unawareness of the involved industrial partners of the potential use of VR in the
early stages of design; VR is associated with CAD applications, expensive user interfaces and
technically complex tools. Showing demonstrations of early stage VR applications (often

Facilitating User Involvement in Product Design Through Virtual Reality 109

implemented using off-the-shelf technology) triggered the participants to explore new
opportunities.
Each case study is placed in the framework according to the dimensions introduced in the
previous section, as shown in Figure 1. As mentioned in the previous section, several case
studies span multiple design phases. The detailed case study descriptions elaborate on this
by explaining how some applications can indeed be useful across several design phases.
Furthermore, the application context, technical implementation and the specific contribution to
user involvement is explained.

development process and the achieved level of user engagement.

Table 1. Brief descriptions of the ten case studies and their application domains.

4.1. Lane change support system in driving simulator
Application Context – To investigate user preferences for a new lane change support system, an
immersive driving simulator was developed [15]. A lane change support system helps a
driver to safely change lanes on a highway, for instance by warning the driver about
vehicles in a blind spot. The driving simulator allowed end-users to configure the user
interface of this support system themselves, for instance by setting the level and type of
support. In this case study a group of participants was asked to configure their ideal
interface and evaluate it in a simulated traffic scenario.
Technical Implementation – The driving simulator uses a physical mockup of a car, positioned
in front of a large semi-spherical display. The car mockup is equipped with configurable
dashboard displays, audio speakers and actuators to provide various output modalities
including visual cues, auditory cues and tactile feedback (see figure 2). The dashboard also
features a Wizard-like application that guides participants through the dashboard
configuration options.

configurable dashboard.

The background shows the wall display with the virtual room.

User Involvement - The approach that was used in this case study supports designers in
determining stakeholders’ preferences and finding the best compromise between those
preferences. This resulted in a hierarchy of information that is a detailed, consistent and
reliable image of users’ preferences. The hierarchy provides the designer insight in the
relationship between user characteristics, use circumstances and desirable or undesirable
product characteristics. The evaluation revealed that the new participatory design approach
is viable in the sense that people understood their role in the design process, were able to
perform the specified activities, and that these activities yielded actual results. Users were
enabled to directly express their preferences and realistically experience the consequences of
their decisions. Moreover, determining users’ preferences has happened while immersing
them in the relevant context, but without putting them in dangerous situations.

4.2. Room layout configurator
Application Context – This case study was carried out in cooperation with a design
department particularly interested in ambient experience design [16]. Designers currently use

112 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

physical replica rooms to test different lighting and sound concepts in various contexts.
These physical rooms are not very flexible and cost efficient; a special room has to be built
depending on the theme that is under investigation (e.g. hospital rooms, hotel rooms or
living rooms). In this case study a VR application was developed to help designers with
easily creating room layouts and evaluating the ambient experience.
Technical Implementation – The application consists of a Microsoft Surface Table (a table-size
horizontal multi-touch display) connected to a large projection wall (see figure 3). The wall
shows a 'first-person' view of a virtual room. The arrangement of furniture, as well as the
first-person camera perspective can be controlled using tangible objects located on the
Surface Table that are traced using visual tags underneath each object.

Figure 5. The virtual aircraft galley allows users to interact with the virtual model.

User Involvement – The setup is designed to facilitate multidisciplinary group meetings. The
Surface Table interface enables a group (e.g. designers, end-users, experts, etc.) to
collaboratively compose and review the layout of the room, regardless of the background
and expertise of the group members. Each participant has an equal share in determining the
room layout and everyone is able to explain his/her perspective on the design case. While
group participants are able to create and change the layout of the room, the application
primarily targets concept evaluation tasks; product concepts can be demonstrated and
'experienced' in different settings.

Facilitating User Involvement in Product Design Through Virtual Reality 113

4.3. Virtual aircraft galley
Application Context – In [17] a synthetic environments consultancy approach is proposed that
supports small and medium-sized enterprises in identifying VR opportunities for their
product development process. To evaluate this approach, a case study for a design agency
was performed that concerned the redesign of an aircraft galley. The redesign aims to
achieve weight reduction, extra chairs in the cabin, easy exchangeable equipment and
improved ergonomics. The consultancy approach guided the design agency through a series
of workshops in which the designers identified potential bottlenecks in their development
process. The approach used scenarios extensively to communicate the findings of these
workshops between the researcher and the designers; for instance to describe potential
implementations of VR in the design process.
Technical Implementation – In the end, the design agency decided to use an interactive walkthrough model of the aircraft galley, projected on a large mutli-touch wall display (see
figures 4 and 5). The application for instance allowed designers to virtually walk through
the galley, and open doors or trays. The space in front of the multi-touch wall display is
furnished such that it represents the space in the galley.
User Involvement – The case study illustrates how a 3D interactive visualisation can support
multidisciplinary meetings for the design agency. The setup facilitates scenario visualisation
but also triggers more interactive behavior in the group; session participants are encouraged
to step in and show other participants what they have in mind in a particular situation.

4.4. Urban planning game
Application Context - 'Serious Games' facilitate decision making processes concerning
complex problems. Urban planning is such a complex problem; developing cities, countries
or regions is bound to involve many stakeholders and has many physical variables and
constraints. This case study features the design of a serious game targeting the development
of new city neighborhoods.
Technical Implementation – The resulting application is a multi-player collaborative serious
game played on a Microsoft Surface Table. The table displays a top view of a city in which
the neighborhood is to be developed (see figure 6). Game participants use tangible objects
(e.g. bricks representing houses, trees, buildings, etc.) to modify the city design. The table
responds to the bricks by immediately showing the results of a proposed solution. Game
elements such as time restrictions and turn-taking are used to structure the game sessions.
User Involvement - The game eases communication about complex problems using simplified
graphics and allows players to safely explore the solution space of various Urban Planning
issues in a neighborhood planning project. Each player takes the role of a stakeholder (e.g.
the mayor, an inhabitant or a housing corporation). Through this role, players are able to
suggest and place solutions in the neighborhood (projected on the surface table) and see the
effect. All players, as a team, have the opportunity to negotiate, discuss and decide which
solution is most beneficial to the group (see figure 7). The primary aim of the game is not to

114 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

role in the game.

directly generate solutions, but rather to trigger discussions and explore new possibilities in
early stages of an urban planning project.

4.5. Virtual usability lab
Application Context - The Virtual Usability Lab was created during a case study for a
manufacturer of professional office machinery (primarily printers). The company had
already achieved some level of user involvement in the early stages of their design process
by asking future clients to evaluate new graphical user interface (GUI) prototypes.
However, the reliability of these evaluations is reduced by the fact the GUI concepts were
not evaluated in a realistic use context; the GUI concept is not connected to a physical
printer, so evaluation participants have to imagine what the interaction with the real
machine would be like. The Virtual Usability Lab addresses this shortcoming by providing a
realistic virtual use context in which virtual office machinery can be evaluated by end-users.
Technical Implementation - During the case study two technical implementations for the
Virtual Usability Lab have been developed and evaluated with company participants. Both
implementations include a virtual office environment in which existing and future virtual
printers can be operated (e.g. paper refill, start/stop printing, etc.). The first implementation

Facilitating User Involvement in Product Design Through Virtual Reality 115

uses hand-held augmented reality tablets to visualise the interactive virtual environment.
Pointing the AR tablet on specific AR markers allowed users to see and interact with virtual
objects. The second implementation provides the user with a first-person interactive walkthrough on a wall display. The first implementation enables users to physically navigate the
virtual office by moving between markers and pointing the AR tablet. The second
implementation uses a more traditional interface, but does allow for a more immersive
visualisation. After an evaluation of the two implementations (involving participants from
the case study company) the fully virtual environment was considered more effective for
representing the use context (see figure 8 and 9). While the augmented reality environment
did allow for more physical interactions (e.g. really walking around an object), it failed to
keep the designers ‘immersed’ in the virtual environment. The fully virtual environment
was found to provide a more integrated experience.

Figure 8. A screenshot of the first-person perspective of the virtual usability lab.

Figure 9. Designers (on the right) using the virtual usability lab in a test case.

User Involvement – The case study showed that the application primarily helps with
analysing high-level task flows, such as operator movement between different machines or
locations in the office. Being able to track and analyse these movements, as well as the
actions that take place at each location adds a lot of useful knowledge to the early design
phases. The presented application allows designers to capture this knowledge (i.e. by letting
real operators act out a 'day at work' in a future virtual office), but also to communicate this

116 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

knowledge to other designers, engineers or marketeers who are usually not aware of certain
real-life situations. Physical analyses, such as testing out different positions of paper trays
on a virtual printer, were found to be less useful. Unless the virtual environment would also
simulate weight, friction and other tactile aspects it is usually more effective to evaluate
those aspects using physical prototypes.

4.6. Virtual nursery room
Application Context – The Virtual Nursery Room case study comprised the design of a
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) patient area [18]. A NICU houses premature babies in
incubators and includes a large number of medical appliances to monitor and nurse the
newborn. The involvement of end-users in the design process of such a room is important,
since particularly in medical design few designers are familiar with and can therefore
anticipate the specific use situations of the product and the demands that arise from it.
Neither can the emotional situation of the parents that have their child lying at the NICU be
envisioned to the full extend by persons that have not experienced a similar situation. A
participatory design approach was used to evaluate room design concepts in a very early
stage of the project.
Technical Implementation - For an optimal evaluation with regard to both emotional and
usability aspects, it is essential that users can actually experience the room designs.
Therefore, it was chosen to conduct a participatory session in a mixed reality setting: In an
evaluation session hospital staff engaged with virtual representations of the candidate
designs and judged them on usability as well as on emotional impact. The concepts were
presented on a screen as pictures and in three similar animations. Afterwards, rendered
pictures of the designs were projected life-size on a concave screen. A simple physical table
was placed in front of the projection, representing the incubator. A baby dummy was placed
on the table, fitted with medical material (see figure 10).

Figure 10. Participants acting out scenarios in front of a projected nursery room.

User Involvement - Participants, consisting of nurses and doctors were asked to play out
nursing scenarios within the setup. The participants started with making a first concept

Facilitating User Involvement in Product Design Through Virtual Reality 117

choice based on how they estimated the emotional impact of the concepts. After playing out
the nursing scenarios, the participants concluded that their first choice (based on emotional
impact) had some usability issues. The case study illustrates how relatively simple mixed
reality environments can help participants to better understand (future) situations, and
review them from various perspectives. In this mixed reality sessions participants were able
to evaluate concepts on both emotional and usability aspects.

4.7. Haptic machine lid simulation
Application Context – This case study aimed to demonstrate how VR can help with shifting
design decisions regarding physical components to an earlier stage of the design process
[19]. The case study features the design of the machine lid of which the hinges were to be
chosen. The specification of these hinges (for instance their stiffness) affects the use
experience of the whole machine. Instead of building several prototypes with various hinges
a virtual prototype was created using a haptic feedback device.
Technical Implementation - For a realistic simulation of the lid hinges, an FCS-CS Haptic
Master was used. A grip from a real machine was connected to the haptic arm. The haptic
device was synchronised with a digital visualisation of the machine; moving the haptic
device up and down allowed users and designers to open and close the virtual machine
model (see figure 11). The haptic device could be configured to simulate various types of
hinges.

Figure 11. A designer testing the haptic lid emulator. The display on the right shows a digital
representation of the machine that is linked to the haptic device.

User Involvement – Unlike most of the other case studies presented in this chapter, this case
study focused on simulating physical product aspects. The use of the haptic device allows
designers to efficiently and realistically evaluate various hinges.

4.8. Operating theater design
Application Context - This case study comprises the design and evaluation of a VR design tool
for operating theaters [20]. The application supports stakeholders of dedicated endoscopic

118 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

operating theaters, such as surgeons, nurses and anesthetists, with the design of a ceiling
mounted arm (CMA) systems in a virtual operating theater environment and gain insight in
consequences of design decisions.
Technical Implementation – The VR application consists of a Microsoft Surface Table, a large
wall display and miniature physical models of the CMA systems. The Surface Table
displays a top down view of an operating theater, in which participants can create CMA
concepts by placing the miniature CMA models (see figure 12). The models correspond to
digital CMA systems in the virtual environment, projected on the large wall display. The
wall display allows participants to walk-through the operating theater while still modifying
it on the Surface Table (see figure 13).

Figure 12. The Surface Table with tangible CMA (Ceiling Mounted Arm) systems used for the
operating theater design case study.

Figure 13. Operating theatre design; the surface table is used as an interface for the virtual theater
(shown in the background)

User Involvement – The setup allows session participants to immerse into the environment by
the use of movable virtual avatars and experience the consequences of the design decisions
they have made. The effect of re-positioning a CMA system (which is difficult in real-life) is
immediately visible for everyone on the wall display. As such the application can be used to
evaluation CMA design concepts, but also to reenact use scenarios with future CMA
systems, list priorities, etc.

Facilitating User Involvement in Product Design Through Virtual Reality 119

4.9. ADAS feedback modality simulator
Application Context – The design of advanced driver assistance systems faces the challenge of
providing automated support behavior that complements the human driver safely and
efficiently. Driving simulators can be used to test these new systems, as illustrated in the
Lane-Change Support case study. However, developing accurate virtual prototypes of these
systems is time consuming. This case study therefore investigated the use of human
emulation as a simulation alternative (known as the Wizard of Oz approach) [21].
Technical Implementation - An automated and an emulated version of a lateral support
system were compared in a fixed-base driving simulator setup. Test participants are given a
driving task (e.g. follow a preceding car). During this task they are given a cue on which
they have to respond. The driver support was either generated by a predefined automatic
version or by a human co-driver that emulated the support behavior. Co-drivers were
seated behind a curtain and drivers were unaware of their presence and task. Co-Drivers
controlled a secondary steering wheel which was connected to the drivers’ steering wheel.
User Involvement – The case study addresses the same topic as the Lane-Change Support
System case study, but provides users with predefined designs rather than asking users to
generate solution concepts themselves. As a result, the technical complexity of this setup is
reduced. The case study revealed that the behavior of a future driver support system can
effectively and realistically be programmed as a human operator instead of a virtual
prototype of the system. Consequently this approach is considered very useful for early
concept selection.

Figure 14. ADAS Feedback Modality Simulator: on the left, a human operator can send cues (e.g. haptic
cue via steering wheel) to a test participant in the simulator (on the right)

4.10. AR discussion table
Application Context – The Augmented Reality (AR) Discussion Table was developed for a
manufacturer of industrial dough processing machines. The client was interested in

120 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

increasing end-user involvement in their product development process. The primary
challenge in this case study was the communication between machine engineers, end-users
(machine operators) and decision makers (customers). Especially when customers have to
decide whether or not a proposed machine design meets their requirements it is sometimes
difficult to reach an understanding between the stakeholders.
For this application an Augmented Reality (AR) table was developed to provide a more
intuitive visualisation of machine design proposals. While the engineers currently use 2D
technical drawings and sometimes renders of CAD models, the AR table provides an
interactive 3D visualisation of an entire machine layout.
Technical Implementation – The AR Table uses an off-the-shelf web camera that is pointed on
a table surface. The camera stream is sent to AR tracking software to identify and track
specific markers. The position and orientation of each marker corresponds to a specific
machine CAD model, resulting in a 3D interactive representation of the machine layout.
Each machine can be rotated and re-positioned by moving the markers on the table, or by
rotating the camera around the table. The entire 3D scene is projected on a large display next
to the table.
User Involvement – Similarly to the Room Layout Configurator this application offers a lowthreshold multi-user interface for manipulating 3D scenes. The AR table can be used to
support meetings between the engineers, sales department and potential customers,
allowing all participants to change or inspect the machine setup.

projected on top of these markers.

5. Review
The overview of case studies illustrates the diversity of opportunities for VR applications in
the early stages of the product development process and confirms the industrial need for
this type of applications. Structuring the case studies according to their position in the PDP
and the achieved level of user engagement provides several insights regarding the
facilitation of user engagement through VR.

Facilitating User Involvement in Product Design Through Virtual Reality 121

5.1. Application scope
The majority of the presented VR applications have a relatively narrow scope, meaning that
they target a particular phase in the early stages of the PDP. Only the development of
entirely new complex systems (such as driver assistance systems) benefits from VR support
throughout the first three phases of its development: virtual prototypes can elicit product
requirements, can be tested and improved by end-users, and serve as an evaluation or
validation platform in the final stages of concept design. In return for a relatively high
investment this offers a safe, flexible and time efficient development approach. For redesign or incremental innovation projects on the other hand, VR can be particularly useful
for evaluating multiple concept directions. For instance, the re-design of office machinery
does not usually involve radical modifications, but would benefit from being able to quickly
evaluate several minor modifications to existing products.
As explained in section 2 of this chapter, scenarios and gaming techniques proved to be
useful supporting principles in several case studies. Scenarios have been used to embed a
specific VR technology in a more extensive approach, as illustrated in the Office Machinery
and the Aircraft Galley case studies; participants act out predefined scenarios in a virtual
environment. The use of the virtual environment strengthens the realism of the scenarios,
while the scenarios add 'meaning' to the virtual environment. In the Urban Planning Game
game elements made 'wicked problems' manageable for non-expert stakeholders, for
instance by using metaphors and simplified scoring systems.
Specifying a proper balance between VR, supporting principles and other tools and methods
turns out to be case dependent. In the automotive case studies for instance, the VR
simulation and evaluation platform forms the basis of the method. The NICU case study on
the other hand shows a more traditional participatory design process of which VR is a
relatively small part.

5.2. User engagement
While it is not possible to strictly allocate an application to a certain level of user
engagement, the majority of the early stage VR applications facilitates evaluation tasks, and
aims to 'design with' end-users. A higher level of user engagement is possible, but often
requires technically complex VR applications. With this level of engagement, the VR
application needs to provide an appropriate user interface and flexible modeling features.
Furthermore, end-users may need additional training or instructions to participate. In the
ADAS interface configuration case study for instance, participants received instructions on
how to create their personal user interface. However, emerging interface technologies such
as multi-touch displays allow for more intuitive interactions, making it easier for end-users
to participate in generating or at least modifying product concepts, as shown in the case
studies that used a Surface Table as input device. When using VR to support the lower level
of user engagement, it is obvious that VR facilitates the design process, but the added value
with respect to user engagement is usually less obvious compared to the higher levels of
engagement.

122 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

6. Conclusion
The case studies show how VR facilitates user involvement in various phases of the design
process. While it should be noted that the review of case studies is currently limited to our
own experience, the resulting insights could be valuable on a more generic level as well. The
case studies were characterized based on the design phase application as well as the level of
user engagement. The majority of the VR applications aims to 'design with users' in concept
evaluations. From an industrial point of view, this type of application offers clear 'value for
money'; they are not as complex as for instance the concept generation tools, yet offer clear
benefits with respect to user engagement. Nevertheless, new interaction technologies more
and more reduce the threshold for exploring concept generation and modification
applications.
Successful deployment of VR in the early stages of a product development process is still
very much case dependent. Incremental development seems to benefit from task specific
applications while for new product development a wider scope of VR support could be
worth the investment. Furthermore, supporting principles such as gaming techniques and
scenarios can extend and strengthen the applicability of VR; VR can become part of a
scenario based approach, or scenarios and gaming techniques can be used to give meaning
to a VR application.

1. Introduction
The main aim of a research project (Sampaio and Gomes, 2011), now in progress at the
Department of Civil Engineering of the Technical University of Lisbon, is to develop virtual
models as tools to support decision-making in the planning of construction management
and maintenance, PTDC/ ECM/67748/ 2006, Virtual Reality technology applied as a support tool
to the planning of construction maintenance. A first prototype for the lighting system had
already been completed (Sampaio et al., 2009). A second prototype concerning construction
planning is now complete (Santos, 2010) and two Virtual Reality (VR) models concerning
maintenance of the closure of interior (Rosário, 2011) and exterior (Gomes, 2010) walls are
also finished. This chapter describes these three later models created as part of the overall
research project.
Applications based on Virtual Reality technology for use in construction and maintenance
planning of buildings were developed (Fig. 1).

The first, applied to construction, is an interactive virtual model designed to present
plans three-dimensionally (3D), connecting them to construction planning schedules,
resulting in a valuable asset to the monitoring of the development of construction
activity. The 4D (3D+time) application considers the time factor showing the 3D
geometry of the different steps of the construction activity, according to the plan
established for the construction.
A second VR model was created in order to help in the maintenance of exterior closures
of walls in a building. It allows the visual and interactive transmission of information
related to the physical behaviour of the elements. To this end, the basic knowledge of
material most often used in façades, anomaly surveillance, techniques of rehabilitation,
and inspection planning were studied. This information was included in a database that
supports the periodic inspection needed in a program of preventive maintenance.

A third VR model is an application concerning the maintenance analyses of interior
wall allowing the visualization of the degradation over time of the painted elements of
a building. The virtual model support the inspection activity helping to choose the
anomalies, the provable causes and the most adequate repair methodologies. In
addition, a chromatic scale is created and associated with the walls covering elements to
evaluate their degradation since they are painted until they reach their expected
durability, and needed to be repainted.

Figure 1. VR models of construction and coating elements of exterior and interior walls.

This work brings an innovative contribution to the field of construction and maintenance
supported by emergent technology. The building lifecycle is in constant evolution, so
require the study of preventive maintenance, though, for example, the planning of periodic
local inspections and corrective maintenance with repair activity analysis. For this reason,
the VR models facilitative the visual and interactive access to results, supporting the
drawing-up of inspection reports. The focus of the work is on travelling through time, or the
ability to view a product or its components at different points in time throughout their life.
In maintenance, the time variable is related to the progressive deterioration of the materials
throughout the building’s lifecycle.

2. 4D and VR models in construction
These interactive models integrate VR technology and applications implemented in Visual
Basic (VB) language. The models allow interaction with the 3D geometric model of a
building, visualizing components for each construction. They are linked to databases of the
corresponding technical information concerning the maintenance of the materials used as
interior and exterior closures. The principal objective of the interactive VR prototypes is to
support decision-making in the area of maintenance planning.
Currently, the management of information related to the maintenance of buildings is based
on the planning of action to be taken and on the log of completed work. The capacity to
visualize the process can be added through the use of three-dimensional (3D) models which
facilitate the interpretation and understanding of target elements of maintenance and of 4D
(3D+time) models through which the evolution of deterioration can be visually
demonstrated and understood. Furthermore, the possibility of interaction with the
geometric models can be provided through the use of VR technology.

Construction and Maintenance Planning Supported on Virtual Environments 127

Information technology, namely 4D modelling and VR techniques, is currently in use both
in the construction activity and in education (Mohammed, 2007). At the Department of Civil
Engineering, some didactic models have already been generated. The research project
presented in this chapter follows on from that previous educational work: two 3D geometric
models which support activity in the rehabilitation of buildings (Sampaio et al., 2006); and
three VR models developed to support classes in Civil Engineering (wall, bridge and roof
construction) in Technical Drawing, Construction and Bridge disciplines (Sampaio et al.,
2010). The didactic VR models are in common use in both face-to-face classes and on an elearning platform.
In construction industry, from the conception to the actual implementation, project designs
are presented mostly on chapter, even though the two dimensional reading is often not
enough, as mistakes can be introduced in early stages of conception or elements
misunderstood on the construction site. 3D models present an alternative to avoid
inaccuracies, as all the information can be included with the necessary detail. Computer
systems used in construction for graphic representation have experienced a vast evolution,
allowing new ways of creating and presenting projects. 4D models, also labelled as 3D
evolutionary models, permit a better comprehension of the project throughout its life,
minimizing the information loss through the chain of events. In addition VR technology can
present a step-by-step guide in assembling complex structures in an interactive way. One of
the benefits of VR in construction is the possibility of a virtual scenario being visited by the
different specialists, exchanging ideas and correcting mistakes. Some applications are
already offering the possibility of communication between different specialties while
developing a mutual project (Yerrapathruni et al. 2003).
In construction management, over the years, technical drawings have played a crucial role
in communication between the numerous partners in a project. Generally, drawings
represent formal solutions, and often incompatibility mistakes are only detected at
advanced stages, on site, accruing additional costs. In this field 4D models promote the
interaction between the geometric model and construction activity planning, allowing
immediate perception of the evolution of the work. In planning, in correct evaluation and
the meeting of needs as they arise, 4D models constitute a positive contribution to decisionmaking when establishing planning strategies (Webb and Haupt, 2003).
Virtual Reality technology can support the management of data that is normally generated
and transformed or replaced throughout the lifecycle of a building. This technology
constitutes an important support in the management of buildings allowing interaction and
data visualization. At present, the management of building planning can be presented in 3D
form and various materials can be assigned to the fixtures and furnishing enabling the user
to be placed in the virtual building and view it from inside as well as outside. This study
contemplates the incorporation of the 4th dimension, that is, time, into the concept of
visualization. The focus of the work is on travelling through time, or the ability to view a
product or its components at different points in time throughout their life. In maintenance,
the time variable is related to the progressive deterioration of the materials throughout the

128 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

building’s lifecycle. It is implicit that the incorporation of the time dimension into 3D
visualization will enable the designer/user to make more objective decisions about the
choice of the constituent components of the building.
The chapter describes both (interior and exterior walls) maintenance models, highlighting the
constitution of the database supporting the models, and the organization of a user-friendly
interface designed to be used by an inspection worker. During the construction of these
models, the basic knowledge of the topics involved, such as aspects related to the materials,
the techniques of rehabilitation and conservation and the planning of maintenance is outlined
and discussed. In addition, methods of interconnecting this knowledge with the virtual model
are explored. These prototypes were trailed in an actual project. The lifecycle aspects of the
construction activity are in constant evolution, so require the study of preventive maintenance,
through, for example, the planning of periodic local inspections and corrective maintenance
with repair activity analysis. For this reason, the model facilitates the visual and interactive
access to results, supporting the drawing-up of inspection reports.
The construction model brings an innovative aspect to 4D modelling as usually applied to
construction planning, through the incorporation of pictures into the interface of the VR
model, an important support element in the comparison between what is planned and what
is in progress in situ after each construction task.

3. Construction planning model
Construction management can be defined as the planning, co-ordination and control of a
project from conception to completion (including commissioning) on behalf of a client
(Walker, 2002).
This requires the identification of the client's objectives in terms of usage, function, quality,
time and cost, and the establishment of relationships between the people involved,
integrating, monitoring and controlling the contributors to the project and their output, and
evaluating and selecting alternative solutions in pursuit of the client's satisfaction with the
outcome of the project. It is essential, therefore, that the project designer has the depth of
knowledge to be able to correctly identify the different stages of the construction planning,
as well as to take into consideration the logistics and resources involved in the project. The
construction planning used in the implemented prototype is realistic and considers the
graphic and written documentation, measurements and quantities map, specifications and
regulations relevant to the project (Leinonen et al. 2003).
A prototype based on VR technology with application to these demands of construction
planning, was created. This interactive virtual model presents the project in 3D, integrated
with the construction planning schedule, resulting in a valuable asset in monitoring the
development of the construction activity, compared to the construction planning already
drawn up. The 4D application allows the time factor to be considered in conjunction with
the 3D geometry of the different steps of the construction activity, according to the schedule
established for the construction, thus offering a detailed analysis of the construction project.

Construction and Maintenance Planning Supported on Virtual Environments 129

Additionally, VR technology allows the visualization of different stages of the construction
and interaction with the real-time construction activity. This application clearly shows the
constructive process, avoiding inaccuracies and building errors, thereby facilitating better
communication between partners in the construction process. This application was
developed in three stages:






Planning takes into consideration the final purpose of the presentation, and the
definition of tasks; the details, therefore have to be in line with this idea. Using Microsoft
Project 2007, the tasks are introduced and the relations between them defined;
Geometric modelling needs to relate correctly to the tasks as defined at the planning
stage. Using AutoCAD 2010 as a modelling tool, the layers make the distinction between
the different tasks and elements are created in enough detail to support correct
comprehension. The application also presents a real-time illustration of the evolution of
the construction through photographs of the site, taken at specific points in time;
The third stage, integration of the first two stages, makes use of two programs. EON
Studio 5.0 (2010) and Microsoft Visual C# 2008 Express Edition, where the first takes the
3D model created with AutoCAD and introduces it in the application developed using
the second.

3.1. Interface
The application, developed in C#, integrates all the components described with the interface
as shown in Fig. 2. The application his organized as outlined below: Virtual model; pictures
of construction site; planning task list; Gantt map.

Figure 2. Application interface.

130 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

The interaction with the application is made through Planning task list and Gantt map. Both
the task list items and Gantt map bars are buttons which, when pressed, send the
information to the EON for the task selected, and in return EON presents the model in the
current state, that is, it shows and hides specific elements depending on the specific stage of
the construction.
EON can interact with the model in a number of different ways. In this prototype only the
state of the elements and camera position is changed. The state of an element is presented by
its Hidden property, whether it is selected or not, whilst the camera position is determined
by translation and rotation coordinates. EON Studio also offers the possibility of changing
the material associated with each element, creating a more realistic model.
Any new objects can be introduced into the application, just by modelling the new elements
considering their positions relative to the ones already in the simulation and programming
the associated action in EON Studio.
Likewise, the application accepts any kind of construction project, as long as its
implementation imperatives are met. Additionally, with the appropriate models, it can also
be used in construction site management.

3.2. Programming details
The weakness of this prototype lies in the time needed to carry out the preparation for the
actual interaction with the application. Modelling a building may not be very extensive. The
programming of the actions in EON Studio, however, can be time-consuming.
In the application, the geometric model of the building is presented in a sequence simulating
the construction activity. For that, each modelled component of the building is connected to
the programming instruction: hidden and unhidden (Fig. 3).

Figure 3. Hidden and unhidden instruction.

This is one of the capacities allowed by the EON software. The command of unhide is linked
to each step (label of the list of activities and bar of the Gant map) and to each geometric
model. The identification both in the list/map and the related geometric model is established
by a number. The number corresponds to the sequence defined in the design project. An
action will begin when the user click over a label or a bar.

Construction and Maintenance Planning Supported on Virtual Environments 131

Fig. 4 presents a tree of links connecting the command of interaction (executed by the user)
and the instruction show of the respective element (see the instruction showelement_n linked
to the geometric model identified by the n number).

Figure 4. Diagram of actions hidden/unhidden for each element and the control of the camera.

In addition the control of the position and orientation of a camera (position, zoom and
orientation of the model in relation to the observer) must be defined in accordance with the
selected construction step. The position of the camera is controlled within the EON software
as shown in Fig. 4. A first position of the camera is defined in order to allow the user to
visualize adequately the selected detail of the building (Fig. 5). After that the user is free to
walkthrough inside and around the model. For that the user must interact with the 3D
model through the VR window of the interface.

Figure 5. Control of the translation and rotation movements of the model.

3.3. Example of application
As a method of testing the application, a construction project was undertaken, more
particularly, the structure of a building, using both its graphic documentation, that is, the
architectural and structural blueprints, and the project description and construction
planning (Fig. 6). The whole project was simplified to serve this chapter’s academic
purposes: the list of tasks was defined based on the more characteristic stages of a
construction process, and a few tasks focused on the construction details of certain elements.

132 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

Figure 6. Construction planning (list and Gantt map) and the 3D model of the building structure.

As a result, AutoCAD layers were created for each task defined and the 3D model
constructed. When finished, the 3D model was exported to EON Studio, where a diagram of
events was created, after which the application was ready to be used. As explained above,
the task list and the virtual model are connected: when selecting a task, the relevant
construction stage is presented (Fig. 7). The first scenario is the landscape and then the
foundation work is shown. There being no picture associated, the camera symbol becomes
visible instead.

Figure 7. Application's virtual model and task list.

Some construction details have been modelled. Progress across three different stages, of one
of the columns and a detail of the reinforcement and concrete of a slab, are shown in Fig. 8.
When constructing a building, the planning sometimes needs to be changed due to
unexpected occurrences. Implementing these changes in the prototype is actually very
simple, as the user has only attribute new start and finishes dates to the task in MS Project
and load the new file into the application.

Construction and Maintenance Planning Supported on Virtual Environments 133

Figure 8. Column and slab construction: reinforcement, formwork and concreting.

All steps have been modelled and linked to the planning chart. Fig. 9 shows the details of
the construction work. The date for each visualized task is shown in the upper left corner of
the virtual model window.

Figure 9. Sequence of the construction process.

When a task is selected in the construction planning chart the static position of the model is
presented. A first view is always linked to a task. This was established to provide easier
interaction with the 3D model, and to focus the attention of the user on the important
sections of each task, guiding them through the proper course of development of the
construction. Next, the user can manipulate the virtual model, in order to choose the
identical perspective as that shown in the photo. So, with the visualization of what is
planned and what has been done in the real building, the construction work can be better
compared and analysed (Fig. 10).
In addition by manipulating the model the user can walk through the virtual building
observing any construction detail he wants to compare. Comparing with other 4D models
the interaction with the present model is not completed allowed and the pictures obtain in
the construction place are not linked with the model (Casimiro, 2006). This VR model is
more intuitive. So the principal innovative contribution of the model is the incorporation of
updated pictures taken in situ. It helps designer to follow adequately the construction
process and he can introduce the necessary changes in the construction plan previously
established.

4. Interior wall maintenance model
The coating applied to building walls, naturally, performs an important aesthetic function: it
is, however, essentially a protective element for the substrate on which it is applied as far as
the action of environmental agents of wear and tear is concerned. The coating is
fundamental to a proper overall performance of a building throughout its working life.
Materials frequently used in the coating of ordinary buildings are: paint, varnish, stone and
ceramics (Eusébio and Rodrigues, 2009). In Portugal, where interior walls are concerned, the
most commonly used coating is paint. It is a multi-purpose material, used under a variety of
decorative effects, based on a widely-ranging palette of colours, patterns and textures and is
easily applied on any type of surface. In addition, paint, compared to other materials, is less
costly, not only as far as the product itself is concerned, but also in its application, since
relatively non-specialized labour is required. Nevertheless, as deterioration is a given,
maintenance is needed.
Factors such as the constant exposure of the coating to the weather, pollutants and the
normal actions of housing use, linked to its natural ageing and, in some cases to the
unsuitable application of systems of painting give rise to its deterioration and to the
appearance of irregularities, which can negatively affect its performance as both an aesthetic
and a protective element. According to Lopes (2004), in normal conditions of exposure and
when correctly applied a paint coating can remain unaltered for about five years.
Establishing suitable maintenance strategies for this type of coating is based on the
knowledge of the most frequent irregularities, the analysis of the respective causes and the
study of the most suitable repair methodologies.
The completed virtual model identifies the elements of the building which make up the
interior wall coating so that monitoring can take place. The application is supported by a
database, created for the purpose, of irregularities, their probable causes and suitable repair

Construction and Maintenance Planning Supported on Virtual Environments 135

processes, which facilitates the inspection process. The information is recorded and
associated to each monitored element, allowing subsequently, the inspection and repair
activity log to be consulted, thus providing a tool for the definition of a rehabilitation
strategy. In addition, the model assigns a colour to each of the coating elements, the colours
defined by the time variable, so that the evolution of the deterioration of the coating
material is clearly shown through the alteration in colour. The prototype is, then, a 4D
model.
The model integrates a virtual environment with an application developed in Visual Basic
programming language. This allows interaction with the 3D model of buildings in such a
way that it becomes possible to follow the process of monitoring the coating elements,
specifically, painted interior walls, in terms of maintenance, throughout the life-cycle of the
building.

4.1. Maintenance
The General Regulations for Urban Buildings (RGEU, 1951) applied in Portugal, stipulates
the frequency of maintenance work, stating that existing buildings must be repaired and
undergo maintenance at least once every eight years with the aim of eliminating defects
arising from normal wear and tear and to maintain then in good usable condition in all
aspects of housing use referred to in that document.
The time-limit indicated is applicable to all elements of the buildings generally. It is clear,
however, that the regulatory period is too long for some specific components and that,
frequently enough, the time-limits for action are not respected. There are, too, inefficient
rent policies, leading to long periods without rehabilitation, and that the prevailing culture
is one of reaction on the part of the various parties involved in the maintenance process. To
these aspects should also be added the defects sometimes registered during the construction
of property developments, exacerbating the poor state of repair of the buildings. This gives
rise to numerous irregularities which, in turn, frequently leads to inadequate safety
conditions.
According to Cóias (2009), the purpose of maintenance is to prolong the useful life of the
building and to encourage adherence to the demands of safety and functionality, keeping in
mind the specific set of conditions of each case and its budgetary considerations.
Satisfactory management of this activity is carried out by putting into practice a
maintenance plan which must take into consideration technical, economic, and functional
aspects arising with each case.
Collen (2003) points out that investment in the maintenance and rehabilitation sector in
Portugal is still weak compared to that in the same sector in the construction industry in the
other countries of the European Community. She makes it clear, however, on a more
positive note, that some measures have already begun to be implemented here: some urban
regeneration programs have been created, legislation, which focuses on the sustainability of
buildings, has been laid down, and the revision of constructive solutions has been carried

136 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

out, all with the objective of guaranteeing that the maintenance of built heritage be an
integral part of the construction sector.
The maintenance of buildings, then, is an activity of considerable importance within the
construction industry; its contributory aspects of conservation and rehabilitation work need
to be supported by correct methodologies of action, underpinned by scientific criteria and
by suitable processes for the diagnosis of irregularities and the evaluation of their causes.
This chapter aims to make a positive contribution to this field using the new computer
technology tools of visualization and interaction.

4.2. Pathologies in paint coatings
The technical document Paints, Varnishes and Painted Coatings for Civil Construction
published by The National Laboratory for Civil Engineering (LNEC) (Eusébio and
Rodrigues, 2009), defines paint as a mixture essentially made up of pigments, binder,
vehicle and additives. It has a pigmented, pasty composition, and when applied in a fine
layer to a surface, presents, after the dispersion of volatile products, the appearance of a
solid, collared and opaque film (Farinha, 2010).
The durability of the painted coating depends on the environment in which it is used, and
on the surface it is applied to as well as the rate of deterioration of the binder in the paint.
The influence of the environment is the result of the action, in conjunction or alone, of a
variety of factors such as the degree of humidity, the levels of ultraviolet radiation, oxygen,
ozone and alkalis, variations in temperature and of other physical or chemical agents whose
effect depends considerably on the time taken to apply it (Marques, 1985). When their
influence is not counteracted or minimized, imperfections can arise in the coating film, such
as, the appearance of defects in the layer or paint with the loss of functionality where the
desired aim of the application is concerned.
These irregularities manifest themselves in various ways and in different degrees of
severity. Based on the study made of the causes of the defects, specific methodologies for
their resolution were established. Fig. 11 shows common defects in painted interior walls.

Figure 11. Swelling, efflorescence, cracking and blistering (Moura. 2008).

The information gained from the pathological analysis of this type of coating was used to
draw up a database supporting the interactive application. These data support the creation
of inspection files related to the elements which are monitored in each case studied.

Construction and Maintenance Planning Supported on Virtual Environments 137

In order to form a user-friendly database of relatable data, groups of pathologies, shown
below in Table 1, were considered. This classification provides the required automatism of
access to the database and supports the presentation of synopses of the causes and repair
methodology inherent in each pathology.

- A yellow colour caused by ageing of the film of the paint
or varnish;
- Action of environmental agents (solar radiation,
temperature oxygen and humidity) on the binder in the
paint provoking changes in its molecular structure.
- Partial loss of colour of the film of paint coating;
- Action of environmental agents (solar radiation,
temperature, polluted atmosphere and chemically
aggressive bases of application) on the binder and/or the
pigments of the painted coating.

138 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

4.3. Interactive model
The completed application supports on-site inspections and the on-going analysis of the
evolution of the degree of deterioration of the coating. The following computational systems
were used in its development: AutoCAD, in the creation of the 3D model of the building;
EON Studio (2010), for the programming of the interactivity capacities integrated with the
geometric model; Visual Basic 6 in the creation of all the windows of the application and in
the establishment of links between components. All the systems were made available by the
ISTAR/DECivil (2011), of the Technical University of Lisbon (TUL).
The main interface gives access to the virtual model of the building and to the inspection
and maintenance modules (highlighted in Fig. 12). The first step is to make a detailed
description of the building (location, year of construction, type of structure....., Fig. 13) and
representative modelled elements of the interior wall coating, so that they can be monitored.

Figure 12. The main interface of the virtual application.

The model is manipulated in the virtual environment by using the mouse buttons
(movement through the interior of the model and orientation of the camera, Fig. 13). The
coordinates of the observer’s position and the direction of his/her point of view are
associated with the element during the process of identification. Thus, later, when an
element in the database of the application is selected using the interface, the model is
displayed in the visualization window so that the target coating can be observed.
Walking through the model with the aim of accessing all the elements of the building, the
user needs to be able to go up and down stairs or open doors or windows. The virtual model
has been programmed, using the EON system, in such a way that these capacities are
activated by positioning the cursor over the respective objects, in that way, the user is able to
walk through the whole model.

Each wall surface in each of the rooms of the house is a component which has to be
monitored and, therefore, to be identified. Using the model, the user must click the mouse
on an element, and the message New Element is shown (highlighted in Fig. 12). Associated
to this selected element is the information regarding location within the house (hall,
bedroom), wall type (simple internal masonry wall) and coating (paint).

4.3.1. Making an inspection
Later, on an on-site inspection visit, the element to be analysed it selected interactively on
the virtual model. The inspection sheet (Fig. 15) is accessed by using the Inspection button
which is found in the main interface (Fig. 12). The data which identify the selected element
are transferred to the initial data boxes on the displayed page (Fig. 14).

Next, using the database, the irregularity which corresponds to the observed defect, with its
probable cause (ageing) and the prescribed repair methodology (removal and repainting) is
selected (see highlighted area, Fig. 15). The current size of the pathology should also be
indicated since it reveals how serious it is (area of pathology, Fig. 15). In the field Observations,
the inspector can add any relevant comment (Fig. 14), photographs obtained on site can also
be inserted into the inspection window and the date of the on-site visit and the ID of the
inspector should also be added. Several different irregularities in the same coating can be
analysed (field Number of pathologies, Fig. 14) and other elements can be analysed and
recorded and defects observed. Later, the files thus created, associated to each of the virtual
model elements, can be consulted (Case history button in the Interface in Fig. 14). This same
window allows all the data referring to the building and to the completed inspection to be
shown, in pdf format (Fig. 16).

4.3.2. Maintenance monitoring
How long the working life of any construction component might be is an estimate and
depends on a set of modifying factors related to their inherent characteristics of quality, to
the environment in which the building is set and to its conditions of use (Webb and Haupt,
2003). In maintenance strategy planning the probable dates when adverse effects might
occur in each of these elements must be foreseen, and the factors which contribute to defects
must be reduced and their consequences minimized.
The completed model allows the user to monitor the evolution of wear and tear on the
paint coating in a house. For this, technical information relative to the reference for the
paint used, its durability and the date of its most recent application must be added (Fig.
17) to each element through the Maintenance Interface (also accessed from the main
interface, Fig. 12).

Based on these data, it is possible to link in the date the virtual model is consulted and
visualize, in the geometric model, the level of wear and tear as a function of time (see state
of repair, Fig. 17). The period of time between the date indicated and the date when the
paint was applied is compared to the duration advised, in the technical literature, for
repainting. The value given for this comparison is associated to the Red, Green, Blue (RGB)
parameters which define the colour used for wall in the virtual model (Fig. 18).
In this way, the colour visualized on the monitored wall varies according to the period of
time calculated, pale green being the colour referring to the date of painting and red
indicating that the date the model was consulted coincides with that advised for repainting
(Fig. 18). The data for painting and repainting are saved to a list of coating elements to be
monitored in the virtual model. When an element is selected from this list, the
corresponding element is represented in the virtual model, through the preview window, in
the colour that corresponds to the period of the consultation.

5. Façade maintenance model
Façade coatings play an important role in the durability of buildings, since they constitute
the exterior layer that ensures the protection of the wall against the aggressive actions of a
physical, chemical or biological nature. Naturally, they should also give the façade the
required decorative effect. Since this building component is exposed to adverse atmospheric
conditions it frequently shows an evident degree of deterioration, requiring maintenance
work. In order to arrive at the best solution for eventual maintenance and repair work, a
survey of defects and deterioration must be conducted.
In order to better understand the operation of façade coating, bibliographic research of
materials usually applied to this type of material was carried out and a table of
characteristics of these was drawn up. Subsequently, a survey was made of anomalies,
probable causes, solutions and methods of repair for each of the coatings studied. The
visualization of the maintenance data of a building and the impact of time on the
performance of these exterior closure materials require an understanding of their
characteristics (Gomes and Pinto, 2009) (Fig. 19):

Types of material: painted surfaces, natural stone panels and ceramic wall tiles;
Application processes: stones (panel, support devices, adherent products, etc.); ceramic
tiles (fixed mechanism, procedures, …); painted surfaces (types of paint products,
prime and paint scheme surface, exterior emulsion paints, application processes);
Anomalies: dust and dirt, lasting lotus leaf effect, covering power, insufficient resistance
to air permeability or weather-proof isolation, damaged stones or ceramic tiles, alkali
and smear effect, efflorescence, fractures and fissures and so on;
Repair work: surface cleaning, wire truss reinforcing, cleaning and pointing of stonework
joints, removing and replacement of ceramic wall tiles, removing damaged paint and
paint surface, preparing and refinishing stone panels, etc..

Figure 19. Different types of materials applied as façade coatings and some irregularities.

Depending on the role that the façade coatings play on the wall as a whole they can be
classified as finishing, sealing or thermal insulation. The most frequent materials used as
coating finishes are painting, tiling and, as sealing coating of the natural stone:

Paint coating contributes to the aesthetic quality of the building and its environment
and also protects the surface of the exterior wall against corrosion, deterioration and
penetration of aggressive agents (Ferreira et al.,, 2009);
The ceramic coating consists essentially of tiling panels, cement and adhesive and the
joints between the slabs. The application of ceramic tiling to building façades has
considerable advantages particularly as some degree of waterproofing is afforded by
the glazed surface along with a great resistance to acids, alkalis and vapour (Veiga and
Malanho, 2009);
The use of natural stone in the coating of façade surfaces is a good solution both
technically and aesthetically. The principal characteristics of the stones are: reduced
water absorption, sufficient mechanical resistance to bending and impact, abrasion and
shearing parallel to the face of the slabs.

5.1. Database
The most frequent anomalies that occur in the coated façades were analysed in order to
create a database linked to the virtual model that could support the planning of inspections
and maintenance strategies in buildings. This database contains the identification of
anomalies that can be found in each type of material used in façades and the corresponding
probable cause. For each type of anomaly the most adequate repair solutions were also
selected and included in the database. The following example, concerning deficiencies in
tiles, illustrates the methodology implemented in this virtual application (Table 3).

5.2. Interface
The implementation of the prototype system makes use of graphical software programming,
Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0, software to establish a suitable database, Microsoft office access,
graphical drawing system, AutoCAD and VR technology based software, EON Studio.
Many potential users are not computer experts. Human perceptual and cognitive
capabilities, therefore, were taken into account when designing this visualization tool with
the result that the model is easy to use and does not require sophisticated computer skills.
It uses an interactive 3D visualization system based on the selection of elements directly
within the virtual 3D world. Furthermore, associated with each component, there are
integrated databases, allowing the consultation of the required data at any point in time.
The interface is composed of a display window allowing users to interact with the virtual
model, and a set of buttons for inputting data and displaying results (Fig. 20).
For each new building to be monitored, the characteristics of the environment (exposure to
rain and sea) and the identification of each element of the façades must be defined. The data
associated to each element are the building orientation, the type of exterior wall (double or
single), and the area and type of coating.

Once each monitored element has been characterized, various inspection reports can be
defined and recorded and thereafter consulted when needed. An inspection sheet is
accessed from the main interface (Fig. 21). The inspection sheet includes the type of covering
(natural stone, Fig. 22), the anomalies (Cracking /Fracturing) and a list of possible causes to
be selected and associated to the element. Several photos can be added.

5.3. Case study
First, the 3D geometric model of a building was created (Fig. 23). In this case, the building
consists of a ground-floor, a 1st floor and an attic with dwelling space. The coating elements
of the walls were then modelled as independent geometric objects. In this way, each element
can then support characterization data of the applied material and different kinds of
information related to maintenance.

Figure 23. Steps in the geometric modelling process.

All coatings studied were considered in this case-study. Thus the main façade was assumed
to be tiled and the remaining façades painted while hall façades are of natural stone. Fig. 24
shows how to identify a façade in the virtual model of the building.
Fig. 25 shows the inspection report of an anomaly. The developed software is easy to handle
and transport for on-site inspections and comprises information of the causes, solutions and
methods for repairing anomalies.

6. Benefits of VR models in construction and maintenance
Technical drawings and explanatory texts often have little detail and are frequently
insufficient in fully comprehending the object. Using VR models means that mistakes can
more easily be caught before construction starts, which translates into time and cost
reduction. The construction planning model can be used with any kind of construction
project and, being a flexible application, accepts new data when necessary, allowing for a
comparison between the planned and the constructed. The prototype can also be expanded
to include other aspects of construction management, such as resource administration, or to
have real-time access to the construction, through the use of cameras installed on site. The
use of new mobile technologies could move the application to the construction site,
clarifying any doubts about location or position of each component.
The developed VR models to support the maintenance of walls interior and exterior
enables the visual and interactive transmission of information related to the physical
behaviour of the elements. As the VR models are linked to each database in an interactive
environment and have user-friendly interfaces with easily manipulation of the data, they
engender collaborative systems. With these applications, the user may fully interact with
the programs referring to the virtual models at any stage of the maintenance process and
can analyse the best solution for repair work. They can also support the planning of
maintenance strategies. The main aim of the application is to facilitate maintenance
enabling the rapid and easy identification of irregularities, as well as the possible
prediction of their occurrence through the available inspection record. This analysis has
been shown as playing an important role in conservation and in the reduction of costs
related to the wear and tear of buildings and contributes to the better management of
buildings where maintenance is concerned. The developed software is easy to handle and
transport for on-site inspections and comprises information of the causes, solutions and
methods for repairing anomalies.
In addition to the inspection component, a maintenance component was developed which,
being visualized in a VR environment, as well as being highly intuitive, facilitates the
analysis of the state of repair of buildings. By means of a chromatic scale applied to the
monitored elements, displayed in the walk-through of the geometrically modelled building,
it is possible to identify the elements which, predictably, will need timely action. With the
possibility of altering the time parameter freely, the user can carry out this analysis either for
past instants or for future events, being able, in this way, to forecast future operations. This
capacity of the model, therefore, contributes to the avoidance of costs associated to
irregularities which, with the passage of time, become more serious and therefore more
onerous.
The use of new mobile technologies could move the application to the construction site,
clarifying any doubts about location or position of each component. As each 3D model is
linked to a database in an interactive environment and has a user-friendly interface with

Construction and Maintenance Planning Supported on Virtual Environments 149

easily manipulation of the data, it engenders a collaborative system. With these applications,
the user may fully interact with the programs referring to each virtual model at any stage of
the construction and maintenance processes and can analyse the best solution for alternative
to construction plane and repair work. The maintenance applications can also support the
planning of maintenance strategies and promote the use of IT tools with advanced graphic
and interactive capabilities in order to facilitate and expedite the inspection process. The
virtual model, moreover, allows users to see, in the virtual environment, the state of repair
of the coating.
Two other VR models are now in progress, concerning the inspection activity of floors and
roofs of buildings. With these two other modules the research project will be complete. Then
the complete VR application will support different aspects of the maintenance process in
buildings.

7. Conclusions
Virtual Reality technology with its capability of interaction and connectivity between
elements was employed in the developed prototypes within a research project, offering
several benefits both in presenting and developing projects and in supporting decisionmaking in the construction and maintenance domain.
The models support construction activity. The VR construction model allows the
presentation of each step comparing what is planned with the real situation observed, the
pictures taken in situ. The model, therefore, helps the designer and owner to redefine the
early plan introducing changes to the work in progress. Thus, economic benefits of
updating the planning schedule are achieved along with better, error-free construction
with no unnecessary delays. The maintenance model supports the global analysis of the
need for repair tasks in a building, helping the designer to define an adequate plan of
rehabilitation work. The plan must incorporate the repair of all anomalies detected during
an inspection visit, which are reported, with the help of the VR model, it, too, bringing
economic benefits.
Both maintenance models show the characteristics of each element of the building in the
model and the information related to inspection, anomalies and repair works. The
information about pathologies, causes and repair methods, collected from a specialized
bibliography, has been organized in such a way as to establish a database to be used as a
base for the drawing up of a tool to support building maintenance.

1. Introduction
The human exploration of the Universe is a real challenge for both the scientiﬁc and
engineering communities. The space technology developed till now allowed scientists to
achieve really outstanding results (e.g. missions around and landing on the Moon, the
International Space Station as an outpost of the human presence, satellites and spaceships
investigating and exploring Solar System planets as well as asteroids and comets), but at
the same time further steps are required to both overcome existing problems and attain new
and exceptional goals. One of the harshest trouble is the operative environment in which
astronauts and rovers have to work in. Indeed, the outer space and extra–terrestrial planets
have such different physical properties with respect to Earth that both space machinery
has to be conceived selectively and manned crew has to be suitably trained to adapt to it.
Nevertheless the entire product assembly integration and test campaign are made on Earth
in 1G. Given so different ambient conditions, each phase in the whole life cycle of a space
product is thorny and tricky and should be therefore carefully engineered. In particular,
testing and operative phases could involve the most of risks because of the different product
environmental conditions. Micro–or zero gravity environments are both impossible to be
found and tough for a practical and realistic reproduction on Earth. In the past, for astronaut’s
tests, only parabolic ﬂights and underwater conditions lead to some limited success, but their
drawbacks – especially related to costs and dangerous situations – exceeded all the possible
beneﬁts and therefore, nowadays, they have a limited use.
The outstanding development of computer science techniques, such as virtual and augmented
reality, has provided an interesting way to deal with such problems. Indeed, computer
simulation of (portions of) real worlds is currently the best practice to feel one’s concrete
presence into a totally different environment, without being there physically. Virtual Reality

(VR in the following) high realism, immersion and easiness in interaction are the key
ideas for such applications. Realism is to faithfully reproduce those environments, but not
only from a graphical point of view: physical/functional simulation of objects presence
and behavior/(mutual) interaction is fundamental too, especially for those disciplines (e.g.
electrical, thermal, mechanical) heavily based on ambient reactions. Immersion is useful to
enhance perception of the new environment and allows users (e.g. Astronauts, Engineering
disciplines, Manufacturing) to behave as if it was their real world. At the end, interaction
is the user’s capability of communication with the simulation: the easier, the more effective
and expressive the experience; the more intuitive, the less the amount of time required by
(specialist and unskilled) users for practicing it; the more suitable, the better VR capabilities
at one’s disposal are exploited.
The space industry can largely beneﬁt of the virtual simulation approach. In this context,
the main help for aerospace disciplines is related to improve mission planning phase; its
advantages are to allow realistic digital mock–up representations, provide collaborative
multidisciplinary engineering tasks, and simulate both critical ground and ﬂight operations.
But beneﬁts can arise in a number of other ways too. For instance, due to the one–of–a kind
nature of space products, the only product after the spacecraft launch available on ground
is its digital representation. Second, complex, scientiﬁc data can be successfully represented
by VR applications. Indeed, data belonging to astrophysics and space mission domains are
usually very hard to be understood in all their relationships, essence and meaning, especially
those ones describing invisible properties such as radiations. In that sense, a suitable,
graphical representation can help scientists (and not specialized audience too) to improve
their knowledge of those data. Finally, VR laboratories can be organized to host virtual
training of human crews, by exploiting their capability to direct interaction and physical
behavior simulation ([26]).
Thales Alenia Space – Italy (TAS – I from now on) experience in virtual reality technologies is
mainly focused on considerably enhancing the use of such tools. Two main research branches
can be found there: user interaction with the virtual product/environment, and data cycle
(that is from their production till their exchange among engineering teams) management.
In the former case, the research is devoted to virtual reality technologies themselves – with
an emphasis on the way to visualize different scenarios and large amounts of data – while
in the latter case the focus is on the system data modeling. When put together, they shall
converge towards a complex system architecture for a collaborative, human and robotic space
exploration (see [2] for a more detailed insight). Our vision entails an unique framework to
enforce the development and maintenance of a common vision on such a complex system.
Therefore, recent advances in the entertainment and games domains coexist alongside the
most up–to–date methodologies to deﬁne the most complete and reliable Model–Based
System Engineering (MBSE) approach. This multidisciplinary view shall have an impact
on the way each actor could conceive its own activity. For instance, engineering activity
will beneﬁt from such representation because the big picture could be at its disposal at any
level of detail; it should be easier to prevent possible problems by detecting weakness and
critical points; it should improve the organization of the entire system, and check whether
all the mandatory requirements/constraints are met. Astronauts themselves ﬁnd this is a
worthwhile experience to gain skills and capabilities, especially from a training viewpoint. At
the end, scientiﬁc missions could be planned more carefully because the simulation of several
scenarios requires a fraction of time, can be easily customized by suitable set of parameters,

and provides valuable feed–backs under several forms (e.g. especially simulation data and
sensory perceptions). Collecting and analyzing data and information from there could help to
diminish the crash and failure risks and consequently increase the chance the mission targets
will be really achieved. For all the aforementioned reasons, the pillars of our research policy
comprise, but they are not limited to: concurrent set–up and accessibility; several elements of
4D (space + time), 3D and 2D features for data manipulation and representation; exploiting
immersive capabilities; easiness in interfacing with highly specialized tools and paradigms;
user friendly capabilities; adaptability and scalability to work into several environments (e.g.
from desktop workstations to CAVEs).
This chapter is organized as follows: paragraphs 2 and 3 will introduce the space domain
context and the current state of art of VR systems in this ﬁeld. The focus will be put especially
on its requirements, the key points of view of our researches and the objectives we are going
to meet. Progresses in VR ﬁeld focused on the collaborative features and the interdisciplinary
approach put in practice are described in 4. Section 5 is instead targeted on modeling complex
space scenarios, while paragraph 6 some practical example of space applications are given.
The chapter is ending up with section 7 illustrating both some ﬁnal remarks and a possible
road–map for further improvements and future works.

2. Motivation and goals
The aerospace domain embraces an enormous variety of scientiﬁc and engineering ﬁelds and
themes. Given the intrinsic complexity of that matter, space challenges could be successfully
tackled only when all the inputs from those disciplines are conveniently melt together in
a collaborative way. The lack of both a common vision and suitable management tools to
coordinate such several subjects can indeed limit the sphere of activity and the incisiveness of
researches in space sciences. Computer science in general and VR in particular could really
play an indispensable role for space scientists towards a signiﬁcant qualitative leap.
To show up the previous assessment, we chose to discuss a speciﬁc theme from a practical
point of view: the simulation of hostile environments. In this context, the term "hostile" is
referring without loss of generality to those places where either stable or temporarily human
presence is extremely difﬁcult because of harsh physical conditions. Indeed, that is really
the case of outer space and extra–terrestrial planets, but that deﬁnition could be extended to
some environments on Earth too. In the latter case, it could even denote built–up areas after
an outstanding event, such as natural disasters, and temporally unreachable, with limited
communication links, or altered topography. Virtual reproduction of such environments is
a particularly interesting activity according to several points of view. For that end, three
main steps could be outlined. For each of them, examples will be discussed in detail aiming
at presenting our modus operandi as well as some results we achieved. Given that practical
stamp, this chapter has been outlined to highlight the following ideas. First of all, simulation
of environments aids different disciplines to be complementary to each other. Indeed, we
consider our virtual reality tools as connectors between apparently separated research areas.
As connectors, we collect data coming from different disciplines, but describing similar
phenomena, and visualize them as a whole. This multidisciplinary approach is intended to
overcome partial views single disciplines could have and, at the same time, create new ways
to make them interact and combine their knowledge. Practically speaking, the simulation
of a speciﬁc environment in our case mainly involves research areas like astronomy, geology

and meteorology which hardly overlap: the sight they have individually is usually staggered
because they focus on different ﬁelds of investigation; their integrated sight, by spanning
all possible features, allows a complete description of it. A similar case applies also to
engineering disciplines, for instance, when space machinery models has to be conceived.
They could be seen as a complex set of different sub-systems (e.g. mechanical, plumbing,
energy), working together but designed separately from several group of people. People who
typically have the know-how in their own ﬁeld but could have some limitations in ﬁguring
out requirements from other engineering sources. Nevertheless, the real machinery has to
work properly despite splits in engineering knowledge domains. In this context, VR supplies
methodologies being able to simulate a portion of real world(s) according to its most relevant
features (i.e. inputs from different ﬁelds of knowledge) and in an uniﬁed way. Second,
for the sake of coherence with real operative environments, space simulations must reach
the highest degree of realism as possible. In this ﬁeld, realism gains a double meaning,
referring to both visual appearance and correct physical behavior models. For that end, it
is mandatory to deal with the most advanced techniques in computer graphics and engines
for physical simulation. This double faced is the basic element for all the functional aspects
of the simulation itself. Issues like aesthetics and photo–realism are especially very well
polished when a thorough visual feedback is required, such as for training sessions, virtual
assembly procedures and terrain exploratory missions. 3D models like terrain chunks, robotic
machinery and/or natural elements are a natural mean to show huge collections of complex
data and convey the right amount of information. Therefore, scientiﬁc and information
visualization techniques should be carefully taken into account for informative simulation
purposes. In this stage, advice and expertise from disciplines are fundamental to achieve the
most plausible results, especially in modeling properly operational behaviors in such hostile
environments and show related information. Last but not least, our discussion shall implicitly
focus on interactions among several actors when they are dealing with virtual simulations.
Indeed, we strongly trust in usefulness of such simulations for space disciplines, especially in
terms of information ﬂows and the gain each involved side could have by them. According
to that point of view, virtual reality facilities could be potentially the natural way out for
many disciplines. Indeed, its intrinsic way of conceiving multidisciplinary activities could
lead to a novel way to think about (and maybe re–arrange) the engineering process itself.
In this case, the aim of this part is to discuss our own experience in such a ﬁeld. In that
sense, we will introduce a typical example of complex scenario where lots of interactions
between several actors are required. Possible case studies could be collaborative meetings,
engineering brieﬁngs, training sessions and ergonomic and psychological surveys. The focus
is to emphasize the virtuous cycle among participants and aiming at the improvement of both
the simulation and all the engineering aspects of the represented product(s) (see Figure 1).

3. State of the art
The use of virtual reality (VR) and immersive technologies for the design, visualization,
simulation and training in support to aerospace research have become an increasingly
important medium in a broad spectrum of applications, such as hardware design, industrial
control and training for aerospace systems or complex control rooms. VR applications provide
a panorama of unlimited possibilities for remote space exploration, and their ﬂexibility and
power can impact many aspects of future space programs and missions. Modeling and
interactive navigation of virtual worlds can provide an innovative environment which can

core of such a process and, by interacting with it, communications among all the actors shall generate
added value, in term of both easiness in connections and knowledge acquisition / generation

be thought as an excellent medium for brainstorming and creation of new knowledge, as well
as to synthesize and share information from variety of sources. Nevertheless, they can serve
as a platform to carry out experiments with greater ﬂexibility than those ones conducted in
real world. In this section, a review of the projects and works related to the use of VR in the
ﬁelds of (1) planet rendering (see section 3.1), (2) remote space exploration (see section 3.2)
and (3) virtual prototyping (see section 3.3).

3.1. Planets rendering
Recently Google Earth, one of the most popular work related to the visualization of the
terrestrial environment in 3D, has enabled users to ﬂy virtually through Mars and Moon
surfaces, providing a three-dimensional view that aid public understanding of space science.
Moreover, it has given to researchers a platform for sharing data similar to what Google
Earth provides for Earth scientists. The Mars mode includes global 3D terrain, detailed maps
of the Mars rover traverses and a complete list of all satellite images taken by the major
orbital camera. Likewise the Moon mode includes global terrain and maps, featured satellite
images, detailed maps of the Apollo surface missions and geologic charts. Similar purposes
and results are achieved by a number of 3D astronomy programs and planetarium software.
The limited 3D modeling capabilities is their major drawback, nonetheless their usefulness in
terms of public outreach has been deﬁnitively demonstrated by the increasing interest among
the public audience in the space exploration.
In any case, they are somehow limited in providing suitable space industry services. The
importance of supporting scientists and engineers work by highly–specialized, immersive
facilities is a milestone at Jet Propulsion Labs and clearly described, among the others, in
[35]. In this paper, the authors remark the contributions of 3D Martian soil modeling in the
success in accurately planning the Sojourner rover’s sorties during Mars Pathﬁnder Mission.
The need for a well–structured and comprehensive reproduction of large amount of data,
collected during Mars probes (especially Mars Pathﬁnder and Mars Global Surveyor missions)
brought researchers to lay stress on VR coupled to astronomy and cartography applications
([29] [30] [31]). Indeed, frontiers of knowledge can achieve unprecedented and amazing
results as coupled with tailored VR tools: new research directions spent their efforts both
to increase the overall visual quality of the virtual scenes (e.g. see [3]) and improve the user’s
interaction with those VR facilities (e.g. [11] and [34]). In particular, the ﬁrst real, immersive
environment is the one described in Head’s work [11]. His ADVISER system (Advanced

158 6Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

Will-be-set-by-IN-TECH

Visualization in Solar System Exploration and Research) was conceived as a new form of
problem–solving environment, in which scientists can directly manipulate massive amounts
of cartographic data sets, represented as 3D models. Its novelty was in integrating both
hardware and software technologies into a very powerful corpus, being able to extend and
improve scientists’ capabilities in analyzing such data as they were physically on its surface.
On the other hand, a ﬁrst attempt to place side by side virtual and augmented reality tools
was described in [33]. In order to enrich the users’ experience, the authors created MarsView,
where they added a force feedback device to a topographic map viewer. Thus, the haptic
interface favors a more intuitive 3D interaction in which the physical feeling allows the users
to actually touch the Martian surface as they pan around and zoom in on details. The golden
age for Mars exploration from late 1990s onward has really generated an impressive data
mole, whose main challenge is represented by its analysis tools. In this sense, examples
above can illustrate how it could be efﬁciently faced by exploiting simulation and interaction
capabilities. Nowadays, they are considered as unavoidable winning points for time saving,
effectiveness, and catching complex interactions and relationships skills.

3.2. Virtual remote space exploration
Interactive 3D computer graphics, virtual worlds and VR technology, along with computer or
video games technology support the creation of realistic environments for such tasks as dock
landing, planetary rover control and for an effective simulation of the space–time evolution of
both environment and exploration vehicles.
In [19] the major characteristics of the available virtual worlds are described, along with the
potential of virtual worlds to remote space exploration and other space–related activities.
Here, a number of NASA sponsored activities in virtual worlds are described, like ’NASA
CoLab Island’ and ’Explorer Island in second life’ (the latter providing spacecraft models
and Mars terrain surface model based on real NASA data), ’SimConstellation’ that explores
a broad range of lunar mission scenarios and ’SimStation’, simulating the operation of the
ISS, and training the astronauts to work on the space shuttle and space station. This work
also describes some tools for virtual space activities, including Google Mars 3D and Google
Moon. Landing on planets and their later exploration in space missions requires precise
information of the landing zone and its surroundings. The use of optical sensors mounted
to the landing unit helps to acquire data of the surface during descent. The retrieved
data enables the creation of navigation maps that are suitable for planetary exploration
missions executed by a robot on the surface. In [28] a Virtual Testbed approach is used
to generate close–to–reality environments for testing various landing scenarios, providing
artiﬁcial descent images test–data with a maximum of ﬂexibility for landing trajectories,
sensor characteristics, lighting and surface conditions. In particular, a camera simulation
is developed including a generic camera model described by a set of intrinsic parameters
distortions; moreover, further camera effects like noise, lens ﬂare and motion blur can be
simulated, along with the correct simulation of lighting conditions and reﬂection properties of
materials in space. Besides these images are generated algorithmically, the known data in the
Virtual Testbed can be used for ground truth veriﬁcation of the map–generation algorithms.
The work in [13] describes a Human Mars mission planning based on the Orbiter space ﬂight
simulator, where the authors have used Orbiter to create and investigate a virtual prototype
of the design reference mission known as ’Mars for Less’. The Mission Simulation Toolkit
(MST) [21] is a software system developed by NASA as a part of the Mission Simulation

Facility (MSF) project, which was started in 2001 to facilitate the development of autonomous
planetary robotic missions. MST contains a library that supports surface rover simulation
by including characteristics like simulation setup, controls steering and locomotion of rover,
simulation of the rover/terrain interaction, power management, rock detection, graphical 3–D
display. In another work carried out by NASA Ames Research center [7], a visualization and
surface reconstruction software for Mars Exploration Rover Science Operations is analyzed
and described. It is based on a ’Stereo–pipeline’, a tool that generates accurate and dense
3D terrain models with high–resolution texture–mapping from stereo image pairs acquired
during Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) mission. With regard to lunar environment modeling,
a realistic virtual simulation environment for lunar rover is presented in [36], where Fractional
Brown motion technique and the real statistical information have been used to modeling the
lunar terrain and stones, forming a realistic virtual lunar surface, where main features may
be easily expressed as simulation parameters. In this work a dynamics simulation model is
developed considering the mechanics of wheel–terrain interaction, and the articulated body
dynamics of lunar rover’s suspension mechanism. A lunar rover prototype has been tested in
this environment, including its mechanical subsystem, motion control algorithm and a simple
path planning system.

3.3. Virtual prototyping
Prototypes or mock–ups are essential in the design process [25]. Generally a mock–up
involves a scale model, more frequently full size, of a product. It is used for studying,
training, testing, and manufacturability analysis. Prototyping, which is the use of mock–ups
for designing and evaluating candidate designs, can occur at any stage of the design process.
In a later stage, mock–ups are already completed in every detail and can be used for
testing ergonomic aspects. However, physical prototypes can be expensive and slowly to
be produced and thus can lead to delays in detecting eventual problems or mismatches in the
solution under development.
Computer science offers the opportunity to reduce or replace physical prototypes with virtual
prototypes (VP). A VP is a computer–based simulation of a physical prototype and having a
comparable degree of functional realism than a physical prototype but with the potential to
add some extra functionality. By using VP, different design alternatives can be immediately
visualized, allowing users to give real-time feedback about the design alternatives and their
use. Furthermore, changes to the solutions can be made interactively and more easily than
with a physical prototype, which means that more prototypes can be tested at a fraction of
time and costs required otherwise. The last feature is particularly crucial for the development
of ’one–of–a–kind’ or ’few–of–a–kind’ products.
The use of VR can contribute to take full advantage of Virtual Prototyping. In order to
test the design optimization of a VP product in the same way as the physical mock–up, a
human–product interaction model is required. In an ideal way, the VP should be viewed,
listened, and touched by all the persons involved in its design, as well as the potential users.
In this scenario VR plays a meaningful role since it can allow different alternative solutions to
be evaluated and compared in quite a realistic and dynamic way, such as using stereoscopic
visualization, 3D sound rendering and haptic feedback. Therefore VR provides a matchless
and more realistic interaction with prototypes than possible with CAD models [17].

160 8Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

By using VR tools, not only aesthetic but also ergonomic features could be evaluated and
optimized. There are several approaches for the ergonomic analysis in a VR scenario. The
ﬁrst involves having a human operator interacting with the VE through haptic and/or tactile
interfaces and the second is based on human virtual models that will interact with the VP, in
a pure simulation technique. These human virtual models can be agents, that are created and
controlled by the computer, or avatars, controlled by a real human.

4. VR for collaborative engineering
Model Based System Engineering (MBSE) is the term currently used to represent the transition
between system data management through documents (e.g. speciﬁcations, technical reports,
interface control documents) to standard–based semantically meaningful models, to be
processed and interfaced by engineering software tools. MBSE methodologies enable a
smoother use of VR in support to engineering teams, representing one of the most interesting
applications.
The core of a MBSE approach is the so–called system model, that is the collection of different
models, representing one of the possible baselines of the product, and formally describing
the different, characterizing features throughout the product life cycle. In particular MBSE
provides a consistent representation of data from the system requirements to the design and
analysis phases, ﬁnally including the veriﬁcation and validation activities. With respect to
a more document–centric approach, the different characteristics of a product are deﬁned
more clearly, from its preliminary deﬁnition up to a more detailed representation. This
shall ensure less sensitivity to errors than the traditional document–centric view, still widely
used for system design. MBSE methodologies have highlighted the capability to manage
the system information more efﬁciently compared to the existing approaches. This process
allows introducing advantages that draws attention particularly for commercial implications.
Indeed, since the last decade many industrial domains have been adopting a full–scale
MBSE approach through their research, developments and applications, as demonstrated by
INCOSE (International Council of System Engineering, [41]) initiatives in that sense. There
is not a unique way to approach MBSE. The main discriminating factor is the deﬁnition
of concepts, as a semantic foundation derived from the analysis of the system engineering
process. The resulting conceptual data model shall be able to support the product and
process modeling, with a particular emphasis on the data to be exchanged during the
engineering activities, considering both people and computer tools. The selection or deﬁnition
of the modeling and notation meta–models is speciﬁc to the needs of a particular domain,
and even engineering culture, but it shall be compatible with current efforts, so to assure
compatibility between tools and companies. A joint team from TAS – I and Politecnico di
Torino is currently involved in researches focusing on the latest developments in this domain,
with a particular emphasis on active participation on the related European initiatives. For
instance, worthwhile experiences are: the Concurrent Design Facilities for the preliminary
phases (lead by ESA experience in its CDF [38], but also in the ASI CEF&DBTE [23] and in
industrial practices inside TAS – I); the ESA Virtual Spacecraft Design on–going study for more
advanced phases [8]. The current developments have the objective to summarize the above
mentioned initiatives, giving the possibility to be in line with the ongoing standardization and
language deﬁnition efforts (e.g. ECSS–E–TM–10–25, ECSS–E–TM–10–23 ([37]), OMG SysML
[45], Modelica [44]). The deﬁnition of a system model generally involves several engineering
disciplines in a deeper way with respect to the traditional approach. The project team is

composed by experts belonging to engineering and/or scientiﬁc areas that are very different
among them. In this context the VR deﬁnitely becomes a useful tool in the management of data
available, providing the technology necessary for effective collaboration between different
disciplines. The VR allows viewing directly data and information that are often difﬁcult to
read for those who may not have technical background but who are otherwise involved in the
design process of a given system.
The MBSE methodology is commonly characterized by the deﬁnition of all the processes,
methods and tools that allow supporting and improving the engineering activities. In
particular it is possible to consider some of experiences that are evolving within various
organizations’ system engineering structure and procedures and that are spreading through
technical publications and studies. For instance Telelogic Harmony–SE represents a
subset of a well-deﬁned development process identiﬁable with Harmony [6]. In this case
activities as requirements analysis, system functional analysis and architectural design are
properly related each other within the context of life cycle development process. Another
example may be expressed with INCOSE Object–Oriented Systems Engineering Method
(OOSEM). The model–based approach introduced is characterized by the use of OMG
SysML™ as an instrument to outline the system model speciﬁcation. This language
enables a well-deﬁned representation of the systems, supporting the analysis, design and
veriﬁcation activities [20]. IBM Rational Uniﬁed Process for Systems Engineering (RUP SE) for
Model–Driven Systems Development (MDSD) may be considered an interesting methodology
similarly to the examples considered above. In particular this process is derived from the
Rational Uniﬁed Process (RUP ) and it is used for software development in the case
of government organizations and Industrial [16]. Vitech Model–Based System Engineering
(MBSE) Methodology is another example where a common System Design Repository
is linked to four main concurrent activities deﬁned as: Source Requirements Analysis,
Functional / Behavior Analysis, Architecture / Synthesis and ﬁnally Design Validation and
Veriﬁcation [32]. The elements that characterized the methodologies presented above as other
similar initiatives are particularly suitable for the management of complex situations, which
are difﬁcult to handle when the product development progresses over time. For instance
the study of hostile environments, such as the analysis of certain space mission scenarios,
generally leads to the deﬁnition of high complexity systems. In this case the management of a
considerable amount of data through a coherent and ﬂexible way has expedited the spread of
model–based methods. The growing complexity of systems that are analyzed often becomes
increasingly too difﬁcult to realize a proper collaboration, avoiding at the same time potential
design errors. The MBSE provides the necessary tools to formally relate the possible aspects
of a given system. A representation through the techniques of VR about hostile environments,
as well as a similar view of the data generated, points out many advantages. The VR allows,
in relation to the structure data available through MBSE approach, to deﬁne in an extended
manner the system architecture, while ensuring greater availability of information. Another
beneﬁt is also linked to the clarity with which the VR allows to report for instance the
development phases of a given system. Virtual model directly connected to the network of
information of a unique data structure also ensures access to the most current representation
of the system.
Based on the progress made in recent years VR allowed to generate an ever more faithful
representation of the reality about the possible physical phenomena that are analyzed. In this
manner it is therefore possible to consider the generation of virtual environments where to

162 10
Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

conduct realistic simulations of possible scenarios in which the system can potentially operate
so making use of the time variable (the 4D). The advantages related to this capability are
highlighted in the ability to reproduce situations for which the construction of a real mock–up
requires substantial economic investment. This becomes evident especially in the aerospace
industry where both the complexity of the systems involved, the high amount of changes to
manage and the possible operational scenarios require a limitation of the physical prototypes
that are built. Today space domain is becoming a free worldwide market so there is a clear
trend towards a reduction of economic costs that are incurred during the project and that
most affect the tests that are made on real physical systems. The generation of virtual models
has also the advantage to be able for example to analyze directly different possible design
alternatives. Through the use of VR in fact more people may be involved at the same time
in project activities for which there are discussions about equivalent system conﬁgurations.
Generally the development of virtual environments becomes necessary when there is the need
to face critical situations. VR in fact allows considering environments that commonly are not
possible to reproduce on Earth, as for instance in the case of space mission scenario: gravity,
dust. In a virtual model it is possible instead to recreate some of the characteristic features
that we can potentially ﬁnd during these situations. Moreover it is possible to manage the
system variables to proper modify the scenario, considering in this manner other different
conditions for the system under analysis. This capability could be difﬁcult to reproduce with
real physical elements mainly because of the economic investment that would require. The
simulations that can be realized in VR environment allows also to avoid all the possible unsafe
situations for the possible user. This characteristic becomes of particular interest for human
space activities where often certain actions may lead to harmful situations.
MBSE techniques applied to space projects are often associated to 2D diagram–based models
(e.g. an activity diagram in SysML, a control loop visualized in Simulink), or to 3D virtual
models (e.g. a virtual mock–up built with a CAD application, multi–physics analysis
visualized with CAE tools). These visualization techniques reached a high degree of maturity
in the last decade, deriving from different experiences performed at discipline level. Just as
an example, a SysML–like representation is closer to a software engineer than to a mechanical
engineer. In a multidisciplinary team, the integration of discipline–level deﬁned data in a
system–level Virtual Environment represent an effective way to assure the full understanding
by the whole team of the key system issues, representing a WYSIWYG at product level, such
as a modern word processor is for a document. Figure 2 shows a simpliﬁed example of
integration of tools in VR. The CAD model is used to deﬁne the physical conﬁguration, and
retrieve the related drawing. Current applications allow the user to calculate and/or store in
the same CAD model also relevant properties, such as mass, moments of inertia (MOI), center
of gravity position. Such values are of interest of the whole team and through dedicated
interfaces those properties may be extracted and related to the system architecture (product
structure, interfaces between elements). If in the same integrated environment the CAD model
is linked with the system model providing input for simulations (e.g. mass properties for
spacecraft dynamics) then the Virtual Environment allows a project team to visualize them in
the same place.
The above mentioned approach may be used to visualize products and their properties
(with precise values, such as mass properties or nominal values). As far as the product
elements are linked with the virtual reality elements, also their behavior may be associated
through the related parameters (e.g. instantaneous position). Behaviors are represented by

functions (e.g. Provide Locomotion, with related ports with the Distribute Electrical Energy
function, and the Environment functions for the terrain). Each function (or composition of
functions) can be represented by a model able to provide simulation capabilities. Figure 3
shows an example at data level of linking between virtual reality and Modelica code through
the system model. The integration of simulation models allow the Virtual Environment to
be the collector of engineering discipline analysis, but a complete system level simulator
is still far to be implemented in such way and it is subject of our current research. The
integration of several simulations requires a simulation process manager and a revision of the
simulation models to be able to include the multi–effects. As explained in previous sections,
the virtual environment may contain own simulation capabilities, thanks to an embedded
physical engine, able to simulate e.g. collisions, dynamics, soft bodies. These features may be
used for a rapid prototyping of the simulation, providing rapid feedback during concept and
feasibility studies, as well as during the evaluation of alternatives.
Product and operational simulations does not saturate the VR support capabilities for a project
team. The use of the VR with embedded simulation capabilities may also be used to validate
part of the AIT (Assembly Integration and Test) planning, supporting the deﬁnition and
simulation of procedures, or for training purposes. Procedures can be created in VR, they
can be validated and then made available using Augmented Reality (AR) format so that to
guide hands free assembly task execution (see Figure 4).

natural ﬁnishing line to improve all the designing phases and to support teams during their work.

object in a virtual world has a formal description at a higher level.

5. Modeling environments
Since space environments are extreme with respect to Earth’s ones, a careful model of them is
mandatory before undertaking any scientiﬁc mission. The study of real operative conditions

spans from understanding physical laws to deﬁning geological composition of the surface,
from measuring magnetic ﬁelds to analyze natural phenomena. Of course, the better the
knowledge, the greater the likelihood to succeed in a mission. That is, failure factors such
as malfunction, mechanical crashes, accidents and technical unsuitability are less likely to
happen, while crew safety, support decision optimization, costs reduction and scientiﬁc
throughput and outcome will increase consequently. The added value of VR in this context is
its ability in supporting this need for realism in a smart and effective way.

5.1. Physic laws
Technically speaking, a physic engine is a software providing a numerical simulation of
systems under given physical laws. The most common dynamics investigated by such
engines comprise ﬂuid and both rigid and soft bodies dynamics. They are usually based on
a Newtonian model and their contribution to virtual worlds is to handle interactions among
several objects / shapes. This way it is possible to model object reactions to ambient forces
and therefore create realistic and complex software simulations of situations that might be
hardly reproduced in reality: for instance, by changing the gravity constant to the Moon one
(that is more or less one sixth of the terrestrial value), it is possible to handle objects as they
were really on Earth’s satellite; similarly, precise space module conditions could be achieved
in order to train astronauts in a (close to) zero gravity environment. The great advantages of
these solutions are cheapness, ﬂexible customization and safety. Indeed, with respect to other
common solutions usually adopted, such as parabolic ﬂies, they do not require expensive
settings to work - a modern PC with standard hardware, graphical card and processing
power is more than enough to perform simulations of medium complexity. At the same
time, setting–up virtual world behaviors relies mainly on customizable parameters as inputs
for the simulation algorithms. Lastly, digital mock–ups can be stressed out till very extreme
conditions without their breaking physically occurs. And also ﬁnal users are not subject to
any risks while they are facing a simulation.
The two main components a modern physics engine typically provide, concern rigid
body dynamics, that is a collision detection/collision response system, and the dynamics
simulation component responsible for solving the forces affecting the simulated objects. More
complex cores allow engines to successfully deal with particle/ﬂuid, soft bodies, joints and
clothes simulations. Given all those features, it appears clear why a physic engine allows
studying natural and artiﬁcial phenomena with ambient conditions that are different from
the Earth ones: for example, testing dust behavior at gravity conditions on Mars (natural

phenomena), or driving a Martian rover acting on velocity, friction and external forces
(artiﬁcial phenomena). Virtual reality simulations are so ﬂexible that speciﬁc and reiterated
tests could be performed several times in a row. This could be accomplished for a variety of
scenarios: for instance, training crew in performing particular difﬁcult actions could lead to
ﬁnd the best practice for a given task; simulating different terrain conformations could help
in ﬁnding possible troubles on the way of an autonomous, robotic vehicle; pushing the use of
some mechanical component to the limit could suggest how resilient it is to external stresses,
its risk threshold and so on.
When physic engine results are connected to suitable input/output devices being able to
return perceptions to the user, then the realism of the simulation is deﬁnitely increasing.
Therefore, feedbacks making the user feel lifelike forces and sensations (e.g. bumps of an
irregular terrain while driving a rover or the weights in moving objects) push further speciﬁc
studies in complex ﬁelds. For example, by means of haptic feedback device and motion
capture suite it is possible to perform ergonomic and feasibility studies (i.e.: reachability test
to check if an astronaut is able to get to an object and then to perform a particular action
like screwing a bolt). On the other side, a primary limit of physics engine realism is the
precision of the numbers representing the positions of and forces acting upon objects. Direct
consequences of this assertion are: rounding errors could affect (even heavily when precision
is too low) ﬁnal computations and simulated results could drastically differ from predicted
ones, if numerical (small) ﬂuctuations are not properly taken into account in the simulation.
To avoid such problems, several tests on well-known phenomena should be performed before
any other simulation in order to detect the margin of error and the index of trustfulness to
count on.

5.2. Terrain modeling
To model planetary surfaces like the Moon and Mars ones, a Digital Elevation Model (DEM)
is required. Technically speaking, it looks like a grid or a raster-graphic image where
elevation values are provided at regularly spaced points called posts. Reference DEMs
come from NASA High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment and Lunar Reconnaissance
Orbiter missions (HiRISE [39] and LRO [42] respectively) and represent the most up-to-date
and precise advances in space geology measurements and cartographic imagery. In general,
ground data can be derived at a post spacing about 4X the pixel scale of the input imagery.
Since HiRISE images are usually between 0.25 and 0.5 m/pixel, each pixel describes about 1-2
m. Vertical precision is then also very accurate, being in the order of tens of centimeters.
The altitude computation is a very time intensive procedure and requires several stages
as well as careful pre–and post–processing data elaboration, sophisticated software, and
specialized training. During this process, image elaborations techniques could inherently
introduced some artifacts but despite this fact, a near-optimal reconstruction satisfy modeling
constraints is largely possible. For more detailed information about the complete (Mars) DEM
computation process, see [9] and the on-line resources at [40]. Instead, for a visual reference,
look at Figure 5.
Inserting a terrain model into a virtual scene is only the ﬁrst step we perform to achieve
environmental reconstruction. Indeed, the description of a planet could be more complicated
than it appears at a ﬁrst glance. In the next sub–sections, we will describe how to enrich the

166 14
Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

simulation of a planetary terrain by inserting more typical landscape elements and modeling
natural phenomena occurring on their surfaces.

photo (from http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08813); The original DEM computed as
described in [22]; A front view of our ﬁnal 3D model (raw model + texture)

5.2.1. Rocks
Almost every image taken from astronauts and/or robotic instrumentation shows Mars (and
somehow the Moon too) to be a very rocky planet. But those details do not appear into
reference DEMs, despite their astonishing resolution. Even if those small details cannot (still)
be caught by advanced laser instrumentation, the presence of rocks and stones poses a severe
challenge for robotic equipment because they increase the chance of a mechanical crash in
case of collisions. Then, for the sake of a better plausibility, we have to add rock models
on the so far reconstructed surface. In that sense, studies made for Mars, like [10] and [4],
are really useful because they describe a statistical distribution of them, with a particular
emphasis of those terrains visited during rover missions, like the Pathﬁnder site. Moreover
they can estimate both the density and rock size-frequency distributions according to simple
mathematical functions, so that a complete description of the area is furnished. Those data
turn to be really useful especially during landing operations or when a site has to be explored
to assess the risks in performing exploration tasks. For instance, those model distributions
estimate that the chance for a lander impacting a >1 m diameter rock in the ﬁrst 2 bounces is
<3% and <5% for the Meridiani and Gusev landing sites, respectively.
Our 3D rock models are inserted onto the terrain by following that statistical approach and
according to speciﬁc site parameters such as the total number of models, size and type.
During simulation sessions, that distribution could change. The aim is clearly at forcing
operational situations in order to analyze reactions of the simulated equipment in hardly
extreme conditions. In particular, thanks to the collision detection engine, it is possible
to evaluate impact resistance factors to guarantee the highest level of safety ever. From a
modeling point of view, the rock generation procedure could be summarized as follows: i)
generate a random set of points (rock vertices) in a given 3D space; ii) compute the convex
hull in order to create the external rock surface; iii) compute the mesh of the given volume; iv)
adjust and reﬁne the model (e.g., simulate erosion or modify the outer appearance with respect
to shape and roundness) in order to give it a more realistic look; v) statistically compute the
site on the planet surface where the rock will be laid; vi) put the rock onto that site according
to the normal direction in that point. Examples of rock skeletons (that is after the ﬁrst three

steps of the previous algorithm) are shown in ﬁgure 6, while complete rocks can be seen in
many ﬁgures spread across this paper.

Figure 6. Examples in generating rocks having both different shapes and number of vertices.

5.2.2. Dust
Another issue is represented by the presence of an huge quantity of dust laying down on
the soil. When any perturbation of the stillness state occurs (such as the rover transit or an
astronaut’s walk), a displacement of an huge amount of small, dusty particles is caused: they
could form big clouds raising up quickly and being in suspension for a long time period after
(because of the lower gravity). Scientiﬁc literature describes this phenomenon mainly for the
Moon because of the several lunar missions undertaken in 70s and 80s. For instance, studies
like [1], [15] and [5] show in details the typical behavior of dust when its particles are emitted
by a rover wheel: schemes and formulas are then given (for instance, to determine the angle of
ejection or the distance a particle covers during its ﬂight) with the aim of characterizing this
unavoidable effect, which should deﬁnitely modeled in our simulations since it affects any
operational progress. Indeed both the visual appearance and the physical behavior of dust
have to be carefully represented. In the former case, to test driving sessions under limited
conditions in the vision ﬁeld or to ﬁnd a set of man-oeuvre being able to lift the smallest
quantity of dust as possible. In the latter case, because avoiding malfunctions, especially for
those modules directly exposed to dust interaction (e.g. solar panels, radiators and wheels
joints), is still a high-complex engineering challenge.
5.2.3. Atmosphere events
A thin atmosphere is surrounding Mars. Even if it could not be compared to the Earth’s one,
some weak weather activities happen all the same in it, so that winds blow and seasons rotate.
The presence of winds in particular could be considered as an issue, especially during some
thorny task performance, like a capsule landing. Therefore even this new factor should be
simulated efﬁciently.
The Mars Climate Database (MCD, [43]) offers an interesting set of data particularly suitable
for that purpose. Indeed, it collects several observations (e.g. temperature, wind, chemical
composition of the air and so on), caught at different sites and over periods, and focusing
towards the deﬁnition of a complete 3D Global Climate Model (GCM) for Mars. In [24] and
[14] further details on such models can be found. A complete predictive model for Martian
atmosphere behavior is still far to come to a complete end, but some good approximations
could be achieved through a simpliﬁed version of the Earth’s weather models. In particular
and without loss of generality, a simpler version of equations described in [24] have been
considered throughout our experiments1 . Technically speaking, they are Navier-Stokes
1

Where the simpliﬁcation comes after considering Martian atmosphere distinctive features, such as extreme rarefaction,
(almost) absence of water vapor and heat exchange, lower gravity and so on

168 16

equations describing the 3D wind directions and changes in pressure and temperature. Since
our interest is on being able to describe the weather situation at a given interval of time and
with respect to a limited area of the planet (that is a landing site typically), they are used to
deﬁne a Local Area Model for which the input data come from the MCD itself. In other words,
the goal is to adapt global models to a smaller scale (meso-scale) for which both precision
and accuracy might be guaranteed at most for short-term forecasts. However, caution in
initializing data has to be undertaken because even small errors in them could potentially
have a huger impact for those reduced area.
First results made on the Pathﬁnder site showed a good approximation in describing the
wind activity, compared to different MCD entries. Visualizing them in a 3D environment
(see Figure 7) represent therefore a ﬁrst step towards a fully deﬁnition and integration of a
Martian weather ’forecast’ predictor. When this result will be achieved robustly, missions
deﬁnition will gain another powerful tool to ensure reliability and safeness.

the blowing directions while their size encodes their strength.

6. Scenarios
The goal of this paragraph is to show how virtual reality paradigm can be adopted for real
applications into the space industry domain. Case studies described in the following represent
only a small part of the most innovative activities undertaken at TAS – I. Nevertheless they are
really representative of how ﬂexible and effective VR simulations are for several challenging
and practical problems.

6.1. Rover driving
This is maybe the best example to explain the tight collaboration among several scientiﬁc
disciplines when there is the need to represent several data into a visualization application
only. Indeed, it comprises contributions from: astronomy and geology (high–resolution
planet surfaces and rocks modeling); physics (to handle the behavior of objects according to
speciﬁc environmental conditions); technical engineering disciplines (to set–up the 3D rover
model as a logic set of layers and sub–systems, considering for each of them its working
functionality as both a stand–alone and in collaboration with all the other ones); ergonomic (to
understand astronauts’ requirements about a comfortable and safe life on board and therefore
design suitable tools); human–computer interaction (to design interfaces to help crew in
understanding the surrounding environment and take actions accordingly).
Figure from 8 to 13 shows many of the features aforementioned. We present two different
scenarios: on Mars (Figure 8–10) and on the Moon (Figure 11–13). In the former case, we

Figure 8. The interface for rover driving: Mars scenario. When possible accidents are likely to occur, a
red hazard alert is shown to the driver (picture below).

Figure 9. Danger: the rover is falling down into the crater and crashing against a rock. Another
hazardous man-oeuvre: the rover is rolling over after going around a bend

reconstructed an area of approximately 1 km2 where the Victoria Crater, an impact one located
at 2.05◦ S, 5.50◦ W and about 730 meters wide, stands. Instead in the latter case, our attention is
paid to Linnè Crater in Mare Serenitatis at 27.7◦ N 11.8◦ E. The goal is to drive a (prototype of
a) pressurized rover –that is an exploratory machine with a cabin for human crew –onto those
surfaces, avoiding both to fall down into the pits and crashing against natural hindrances
(mainly massive rocks, such as those ones depicted in Figures 8 and 9). The task is made
more difﬁcult by the presence of huge clouds of dust which, according to the speciﬁc planets
conditions, are usually thicker, broader and take more time with respect to the Earth to
dissolve completely. Since in those situations the visibility could be extremely reduced, the
importance of being able to rely on secure instrumentation, prior knowledge of the terrain
to be explored and accurate training sessions is essential, because indeed, any error could
have wasting consequences on crew and equipment. Therefore, astronauts should be able
to fully understand all the risks, the policies to avoid them and how to approach every step
in such missions. In this context, a VR simulation offers a reliable tool to safely undertake
such training. To help the crew to perform their duty, a suitable, basic interface has been
built. It stands on the rightmost side of the screen where a double panel is shown. In the ﬁrst
one, at the top right corner, parameters such as roll, pitch and yaw angles, level of battery,
speed, acceleration and outside temperature, are mapped onto a deformable hexagon, to keep
them always under control. Their values are continuously updated during the simulation
to suddenly reﬂect the current situation. If all of them are kept under a pre–deﬁned safety
threshold, the whole hexagon is green. When an alert occurs, the respective parameter turns
to red: in this case, the crew should take appropriate countermeasures to face that danger (for
instance, by reducing the rover speed). In the second control panel, a small bird’s–eye–view
map of the surroundings is depicted. On this map, small red circles represent potential
hazards, such as huge rocks. As the rover is reducing too much its minimum safety distance
(that is, it could run into collision with a rock), a red alert appears, so that a correct man-oeuvre
could be undertaken in time. To help the drivers a blue cylinder is projected facing the engine

too. In this case, it points out where the rover will be after a conﬁgurable, small amount of
time (e.g., 20 seconds) if any change in the march occurs. The driving commands are given
through a suitable interface aiming at reproducing the corresponding mean to be mounted on
the rover (e.g. control sticks, levers, steering wheel and so on). They could be either some
haptic interfaces (with or without the force feedback impulse) or, as in our case, wii–motes.
The direction as well as the intensity of the strength applied to the rows is shown by a couple
of green arrows.

Figure 10. The Martian dust. Since Mars is a rocky and sandy planet, ejecting dust is really likely to
happen. Thickness and density of dust clouds depend on several factors, including the speed the rover is
traveling. The presence of dust could be a problem for safe driving, building–up on solar panels, and
unpredictable effects by intruding in exposed mechanical parts.

reproduced here is only a small portion of the whole Lunar soil. Indeed Lunar DEM do not cover yet the
whole surface of the terrestrial satellite.

Figure 12. A possible look for a scouting expedition rover, with both the external and inner views. The
ergonomic in designing machines and tools to explore planets is a crucial aspect in the whole scientiﬁc
mission setting–up, beside its operational functionalities. Among the main requirements needed for that,
we can cite comfortableness, habitability and safety.

6.2. Planet landing
Another essential task (and another typical example where cooperation among disciplines is
strictly essential) is to bring onto the extra–terrestrial surface all the machinery required for

Figure 13. Dust behavior modeling: in a physical environment (leftmost image) and on Moon, where it
is lifted up by rover transit. Dust emitters are positioned on rover’s wheels. In principle, only a small
number of dust particles are modeled. The dust cloud is then rendered for realistic simulations by
adding some visual effects and simulating the presence of more particles around the original ones. All
the equations used to simulate particles trajectories have been taken by [15]. Similar works for Mars are
still missing at the best of our knowledge. Therefore, we adapted the Lunar ones to match the Martian
environment.

the scientiﬁc mission. This operation is usually performed by a lander. It could be thought
as a composition of at least three distinct parts: the capsule, the propulsion system, and the
anchoring units. The ﬁrst module carries all the machinery to settle on the ground; the second
part is used during both the take–off and the landing and it aims at balancing loads and
thrusts and avoiding sharp and compromising movements; the last one is the ﬁrst one to
touch the soil and has to soften the landing and provide stability. This kind of operation is
really ticklish because in case of failure, the equipment is very likely to be lost or damaged
or having malfunctions. To avoid such a possibility, carefulness in choosing the landing site
is mandatory: interesting sites from the scientiﬁc point of view could be landing targets if in
the surroundings a ﬂat terrain, almost rock–free and without any other obstacle is present.
Therefore, an accurate research should be performed prior the implementation of the mission
itself. During the VR tests, different landing sites could be tested, till the most appropriate
one is detected (see the ﬁrst two pictures in Figure 14). Those trials are suitable for another
couple of things. First of all, to test endurance, impact absorption, breaking and tensile
strength and some other mechanical properties of lander legs. In this case, series of physical
simulations should be set up to test changes in parameters and ﬁnd the right combination
of them to guarantee the maximum of safety in real operative environments. (see the last
picture in Figure 14) Then, since dust clouds are a major challenge, blind landing should
be taken into account. In this case, both automatic and manual landing operations have to
deal with complementary sensors (e.g. sonar and radar) integrating previous knowledge
of the targeted site. In this case, VR simulations can help scientists to ﬁnd the best descent
plan according to the supposed hypothesis and the real operative situations, which can be
surprisingly different from the ﬁrst ones. Therefore, plan corrections should be undertaken
to face problems such as malfunctions, higher speed, error in measuring heights, winds (on
Mars) and other unpredictable events.

6.3. Visualizing radiations
Scientiﬁc visualization is an interdisciplinary ﬁeld whose objective is to graphically represent
scientiﬁc data so that scientists could understand and take a more detailed insight of them. It
usually deals with 3D structures and phenomena coming from several science branches such
as astronomy, architecture, biology, chemistry, medicine, meteorology and so forth. Computer

graphics plays a central role because of its techniques in both rendering complex objects and
their features (among the others volumes, surfaces, materials and illumination sources) and
dealing with their evolution in time (see [18]). The importance of visualization is essential to
manage complex systems and when events to be displayed are invisible (i.e., they could not
be perceived because of either micro–or even lower scales or they happened outside the optic
frequency band). In those cases, visual metaphors should be used to show such phenomena
and therefore keep the audience aware of their existence, effects and consequences. This
approach has been successfully applied to projects aiming at investigating how radiations
will affect human health and electronic components during space missions. In particular,
we focused on representing the Van Allen radiation belt surrounding the Earth. This area is
located in the inner region of the magnetosphere and mainly composed by energetic charged
particles coming from cosmic rays and solar wind. The purpose of this study is to show how
radiations will spread and amass on and all around the whole spaceship volume, given the
signiﬁcant time spaceships spend in orbit. This way, it will be possible to design suitable
countermeasures to shield against all the potential risks. As shown in Figure 15, the belt has
been represented as a ball of threads enveloping Earth, getting thicker and thicker as time
ﬂows and spaceships orbit our planet. At the same time, a color scale gives to the observer the
feeling of danger, by ranging from cold (that is, low risks) to warm colors (highest damages)
(Figure 16).

amount of electrons; last two images: protons)

6.4. Cargo accommodation
The International Space Station (ISS) is the farthest outpost of the human presence in space
and can be thought as an habitable satellite. Since 1999, its pressurized modules allowed
the presence of astronauts whose main goal is to conduct experiments in several ﬁelds

by exploiting its micro–gravity and space environment research facilities. Shuttle services
provided in years a continuous turnover of astronauts as well as supplies, vital items and
scientiﬁc equipment. Anyway, carrying provisions and other stuff back and forth is far from
being a simple task, at least in its designing phase. Indeed, the most difﬁcult challenge is how
to put the greatest amount of items into a cargo so that time, money and fuel could be saved
and providing at the same time the best service as possible. In other words, it means facing the
well–known knapsack problem on a larger scale. The CAST (Cargo Accommodation Support
Tool) program has been established to work out that problem by optimizing the loading
within transportation vectors such as Culumbus and ATV (Automated Transfer Vehicle).
Practically speaking, it has to ﬁnd the optimal disposal for items (usually bags) into racks,
that is the main focus is on properly balancing the loading. This means ﬁnding the best
center of mass position for each rack into the vector, such that resource wasting is minimal,
any safety issues will occur and it will take the smallest number of journeys as possible.
The balancing problem can be solved algorithmically through an interactive, multi–stage
process, where problems such as items–racks correlation, rack conﬁguration and item, racks
and cargo accommodation have to be addressed. The result is a series of 3D points, whose
ﬁnal conﬁguration corresponds to how bags have to be stored into racks according the given
constraints. A visual representation of them is particularly useful if it could be conceived
as a practical guide to help people during load/unload phases. In order to allow users
to test several conﬁgurations at run–time and analyze how they will affect the ﬁnal cargo
accommodation, direct interaction has been guaranteed through wii–motes, data gloves and
force–feedback haptic devices. Moreover, in order to guarantee the best simulation as possible,
physical constraints have been added too. So, easiness in picking and moving objects will be
affected by object masses and weights; collision detection among bags and racks will limit
movements in changing object positions and guarantee at the same time the consistency of
results (that is, impossible positions cannot occur).

6.5. Understanding natural risks
Although TAS – I experience in modeling 3D terrains is principally devoted to reconstruct
extra–terrestrial soils, we can present here an example of an application involving Earth
territories. The work comes after Alcotra–Risknat (Natural Risks) project. Alcotra is an
European Commission approved program for cross–border cooperation between Italy and
France. In the context of improving the quality of life for people and the sustainable
development of economic systems through the Alpine frontier between the two countries,
a special care towards enforcing public and technical services through a web–based platform
in the natural risk protection ﬁeld is given. Among the objectives, we can remind the need to

provide innovative technological strategies to manage territory policies efﬁciently; develop
an environmental awareness depending on sustainability and responsible management of
resource use paradigms; coordinate civil defense facilities and equipment in the cross–border
areas. Given this context, our main contribution consisted in a 4D physically–realistic
simulation demo of a landslide occurred at Bolard in the high Susa Valley. Thanks to
stereoscopic vision and 3D sound effects, we developed interactive and highly immersive
scenarios for citizen risks awareness purposes. The demo consists of a 3D model simulating
the physical propagation of debris and rocks slides in a mountain site (see Figures 19 and
20). The simulation has been built on real geological data coming after in situ measures and
given the local terrain morphology and orography at that time. Photos and videos of that
period have been used to both reproduce the slide path along the interested mountainside
and reproduce the likely appearance (e.g., color, density, speed and so on) of the slide itself.

7. Conclusions and future work
The COSE Center facility is an innovative and highly technological equipped laboratory,
currently involved into developing both VR and AR applications to support inner research
at TAS-I. After being successfully used in several ﬁelds such as the entertainment industry,
they have been satisfactorily introduced also in the management of complex production
projects with the aim of improving the quality of the whole engineering steps chain, from
the collection and validation of requirements till to the ﬁnal realization of the product itself.
TAS-I proﬁciently application to its products is double-folded. First, as a new, integrating
tool in all the decision making phases of a project, by supporting manual engineering
tasks and other well-known instruments (e.g., CAD) and overcoming their limitations.
Second, as a set of interactive simulation tools, being able to realistically reproduce hostile,
extra-terrestrial environments and therefore supporting disciplines to properly understand
operational behavior under extreme conditions. The VR facilities could be considered as a
center of attraction to improve knowledge, technical skills and know-how capability. This
enables the COSE Center research activities to have reached several positive results in the
policies of simplifying the team approach to complex products and projects. Among them,
we could cite a better interaction with customers and suppliers and among multidisciplinary
experts too; improving the effectiveness of evaluation/assessment by the program teams
according to a tightly collaborative approach. The good results achieved thank to the VR-lab
have been reached because the system structure and behavior are shown in a more realistic
way to the team. Running several simulation sessions by stressing virtual models under
different conditions is a fast and economic way to collect data about product requirements,
limitations and strong points. Practically speaking, the set of virtual tools adopted at TAS-I
and the current research results has lead in some cases engineering disciplines to rethink
about both their relationship to the implementing system and the necessity to focus on new
critical aspects, emerged during interactive sessions. In some other cases, engineers decided
to optimize their internal process given the results obtained through virtual tool analysis.
In the future, we are aiming at improving the capabilities of our VR facility in several
research directions. First of all, by implementing new features / applications according to
the engineering ﬁelds needs and allowing a more natural interaction with them through
speciﬁc devices (e.g., new tracking devices, touch-screen devices, improved AR interfaces
and so on). Second, by involving a higher number of disciplines in order to achieve the most
complete vision as possible of the environment to be simulated. A complete simulator of
hostile environments is still far from being implemented, but our efforts tend towards that
end. This shall mean that physical engine features would be extended to encompass a wider

176 24

Will-be-set-by-IN-TECH

range of possible dynamics to be reproduced. This shall also mean that a tighter cooperation
with scientist is mandatory to enforce the realism of a simulation.

A System Engineering Perspective
to Knowledge Transfer: A Case Study
Approach of BIM Adoption
Yusuf Arayici and Paul Coates

1. Introduction
The building industry is under great pressure to provide value for money, sustainable
infrastructure, etc. and this has propelled the adoption of Building Information Modelling
(BIM) technology (Mihindu and Arayici, 2008). Owners can anticipate greater efficiency and
cost savings in the design, construction and operation of facilities with the adoption of BIM.
From an architectural point of view the consequences of BIM depends on how the
technology is implemented and integrated into the firm’s business model. BIM offers many
new financial and creative opportunities for most construction related organizations (e.g.
architectural companies), but to realize these benefits firms will need to embrace the
integration of design and construction that BIM will promote. This will require changes in
project delivery methods and in the composition of the firm’s staff. Properly implemented,
BIM may also change the role of professions (e.g. architectural) an expanded role in the
AEC/O industry. To realize the BIM benefits, an active role in guiding its implementation
must be taken (Arayici et al, 2009) (Bernstein and Pittman, 2004).
There is enough evidence to suggest the architectural profession is beginning to come under
pressure to adopt BIM. This information management technology has existed in some form
for over 20 years. However during last few years, building owners are becoming aware that
BIM promises to make the design, construction and operation of buildings much more
streamlined and efficient (Coates et al, 2010). Owners are starting to enforce that architects
and other design professionals, construction managers and construction companies adopt
BIM. This trend gained enormous momentum when the General Services Administration
(GSA) of USA announced that it would require all schematic design submittals to be in BIM
format starting in 2006 (US-GSA, 2008). Many other similar uptakes from Europe and
Australasia have followed (Mihindu and Arayici, 2008).

The productivity increases promised by BIM would seem to make it attractive to architects
and other design professionals, contractors as well as to owners. The intensely competitive
nature of building industry makes it likely that most if not all of any productivity gains
realized by BIM will be passed through to owners and clients. This is what happened with
CAD (Oakley, 2007).
In some countries such as Finland, Denmark, Norway and the USA, the use of BIM has been
endorsed (Aouad & Arayici, 2010) by the government of these states for the state project,
while some other countries have progressed toward it. A fuller analysis of the external
influences which have promoted BIM adoption in these countries may provide an indication
of how development of the use of BIM in the UK might be stimulated. Such factors in the
UK might include the attitudes of market constituents affecting adoption and standards
such BS16001 and the use of BIM in compliance.

2. The construction industry and its features
In the past decade, construction companies spent a great deal of effort and resources in
improving their business processes. New forms of innovative project management,
supported by recent IT developments, appeared in response to ever-growing pressure from
owners to complete projects on time and deliver high quality buildings. Although many
sectors such as automotive, manufacturing and the service sectors have improved their
competitiveness from IT, the construction industry has had some difficulties, resulting in the
construction industry lagging behind the other sectors. The constraints the construction
industry has experienced can be outlined as follows (Aouad and Arayici, 2010):
The Nature of Information and its Flow: Construction projects consist of many interrelated
processes and sub-processes, often carried out by different professionals at different
locations. Most of the tasks involved in construction processes are mainly about exchanging
information between project stakeholders. All construction researchers addressed the need
to improve the poor cross-disciplinary communications.
The Fragmented Supply Chain of the Construction Industry: One of the main features of
the construction industry is the high fragmentation in its supply chain. However, despite
the increasing trends towards multi-disciplinary practical arrangements between
construction firms, such as partnering, the construction industry still consists of hundreds of
small and medium size firms that offer undifferentiated products and services.
The Culture of the Construction Industry: The widespread culture of the construction
industry is a claiming, confrontational one, which has underpinned the inefficiency and the
ineffectiveness of its processes. The strong resistance to change could be partly attributed to
the strong and rigid culture of the construction industry.
Lack of Long-Term Strategic Management Thinking: The absence of sophisticated
management techniques and methods is a dominant feature of common practices in the
construction industry. Many researchers highlighted the coherent lack of management
expertise and the poor applications of strategic management in the construction industry.

Figure 1. Illustrates the current work environment in the construction industry (Aouad and Arayici,
2010)

Figure 1 above depicts the traditional practices in construction projects. The construction
industry is fragmented by nature. Added to this fragmentation between the construction
stakeholders, a high level of complexity of the work flow resulting from a high number of
companies working on the same project increases the inefficiency of construction projects.
For example, repeated processes or functions and duplications due to the lack of
communication and standardisation that causes waste and lead times in the project lifecycle,
and extra cost to the client for non value added activities.
For example, clients and some stakeholders such as local authorities and residents have an
incorrect perception, or lack of understanding the 2D architectural and engineering
drawing. The design team cannot fully understand the client’s needs due to a lack of
communication, a shared platform, and an understandable Virtual Reality (VR) tool by both
the client and the architect. Eventually these constraints will bring about client
dissatisfaction (Aouad and Arayici, 2010).

3. Building Information Modelling and its benefits
In the past, researchers used IT tools for providing numerous decision support systems for
the professionals of the industry. However, these systems have created islands of

182 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

automation and are far from achieving an acceptable level of integration across disciplines
and across the design and construction processes. It is recognised that greater benefits can
be obtained and the constraints can be considerably reduced if a complete integration based
on VR tools is achieved. In this respect, major benefits of a desired integrated VR
environment are considered as follows (Aouad and Arayici, 2010);









Improving the coordination and communication between the client, design team
members, and construction professionals, by using standard formats, and intuitive VR
tools that ease communication and information sharing.
Since VR tools allow the design team to have quick and high quality feedback on the
project, in terms of architectural, technical, financial and environmental aspects, the
design may be evaluated at the very early stages of the project lifecycle.
Looking at “what if” scenarios at the detailed design stage, to assess the design solution
in lighting, acoustic and thermal aspects.
Closing the gap between the design team and the construction team and providing
them with an integrated platform through which they can collaborate for the best
buildability and appropriate construction planning.
The use of past project knowledge and information for new developments.

Furthermore, visualisation in conjunction with integrated model driven construction
systems can be expected to:





Enable designers, developers and contractors to use the VR system and virtually test a
proposed project before construction actually begins.
Offer “walk-through” views of the project so that problems can be found and design
improvements can be made earlier.
Provide a free flow of information between CAD systems and other applications work
packages, in order to minimise misinterpretation between project participants.
Facilitate the selection of alternative designs, by allowing different plans to be tested in
the same virtual world.

Due to its potential, Building Information Modelling has become an internationally
recognized concept. BIM can be described as the use of the ICT technologies to streamline all
the processes that require a building infrastructure and its surroundings, to provide a safer
and more productive environment for its occupants; and to assert the least possible
environmental impact from its existence; and more operationally efficient for its owners
throughout the life cycle of the building infrastructure (Aouad and Arayici, 2010).
BIM in most simple terms is the utilisation of a database infrastructure to encapsulate built
facilities with specific viewpoints of stakeholders. It is a methodology to integrate digital
descriptions of all the building objects and their relationships to others in a precise manner,
so that stakeholders can query, simulate, and estimate activities and their effects of the
building process as a life cycle entity. Therefore, BIM can provide the required value
judgments that create more sustainable infrastructures, which satisfy their owners and
occupants (Aouad and Arayici, 2010).

A System Engineering Perspective to Knowledge Transfer: A Case Study Approach of BIM Adoption 183

BIM as a lifecycle evaluation concept seeks to integrate processes throughout the entire life
cycle of a construction project. The focus is to create and reuse consistent digital information
by the stakeholders throughout the life cycle. Some advantages are (i) model based decision
making, (ii) design and construction alternatives, (iii) costs, energy and lifecycle analysis, the
automated building code checking (Cheng, 2005) or thermal load calculations (Kam et al,
2003) or environmental impact assessment (e.g. CO2 emission), etc. can be performed by
using these models for design changes and use of alternative material types over the
infrastructure life cycle.
Some attributes of BIM include; robust geometry, comprehensive and extensible objects
properties, semantic richness, integrated information and ability to support the
infrastructure life cycle (Schevers et al, 2007).
BIM incorporate a methodology based around the notion of collaboration between
stakeholders to exchange valuable information throughout the life cycle. Such collaboration
can be seen as the answer to the fragmentation that exists within the building industry
which has caused various inefficiencies. The above scenarios show the expected stakeholder
collaboration and the aim of using BIM. Although BIM is not the salvation of the
construction industry, a great deal of effort has gone into address those issues which have
remained unattended far too long (Jordani, 2008).
The Implementation of BIM systems requires dramatic changes in current business
practices, which will lead to the development of new and sustainable business process
models. The rest of the chapter discusses the BIM implementation from the systems
engineering perspective through best practices and a case study of the BIM implementation.

4. The priory scoping study for the BIM adoption
Finland is seen as a leader in BIM use and implementation in the construction sector. They
have a clear vision of BIM implementation at both governmental and operational levels. In
order to capture the best practices in Finland, interviews were conducted with three
academics and five industrialists in Finland to obtain the in-depth understanding about
many years of experience in BIM adoption, challenges, barriers and also strategies for
solutions against these challenges and barriers.
The interviews in Finland were carried out in an unstructured manner, as each company
and institution had a unique experience of BIM and varying viewpoints on their activities. The
unstructured approach to the interviews was adopted in order to capture their uniqueness as
well as commonalities in their BIM experiences. However, all the interviews had the same aim
and goal, which is to understand their views and strategies for BIM use and implementation in
practice. As a result, these interviews enabled the perception of every company’s experience
about BIM use and implementation from their research and practical projects in the last 15
years not only in-depth but also in a broad manner. In order to carry out comprehensive
exploration and analysis, the data collected from the interviews was documented and
compiled together through mind mapping (Novak and Canas, 2008) shown in figure 2.

184 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

Figure 2. BIM implementation concept map from the interviews

A System Engineering Perspective to Knowledge Transfer: A Case Study Approach of BIM Adoption 185

Findings from the interviews have provided a focus on three predominant themes;
organisational culture, education and training, and information management. This shows
that the BIM implementation for an organisation should fundamentally address its impact
on culture, personnel, and the organisation’s use of technologies. That is to say, the focus is
not only on technology but also on process and people.

4.1. Organization culture
As noted the organisational culture is predominantly created and practiced by everyone
involved in the organisations. Further it is an aspect that is inherited as the organisation
changes, grows and merges. Its effects can be identified within the business process,
technologies used and people’s work practices. While these aspects ultimately contribute
towards the organisational readiness to accept BIM, peoples’ ability, their understanding of
the new process, and the availability of the required support including governance are to
provide the necessary environment for achieving a successful implementation process. BIM
implementation has forced technology change and process change within the organisations,
which will force much improvement of the organisational capabilities or services offered. In
most cases, this also involves integration or discontinuation of software and hardware
systems within the organisation.
New systems can also provide challenges in data handling, which require training within
the whole organisation. Due to the nature of BIM, consolidation of data throughout the
lifecycle of a given project will be a reality. Therefore many other applications will be able to
access such data streams to provide further services, e.g. asset management and demolition
management during the lifecycle. In addition, such changes will create new opportunities
and improvements, e.g. design coordination, clash testing, virtualisation services and
streamlined design to product workflows, which can become a part of the core business
process model of the organisation.

4.2. Education and training
Education and training has become an important part of BIM implementation due to the
process and technological changes within the organisation. In order for the
implementation to be successful, all affected people require up skilling. Those who are in
specific positions may need to gain certain standards of education and training. This is
noted as ‘certification’ on the concept map. Those who are trained will engage and
administer organisational process and technological changes that are initiated through
BIM implementation appropriately. Learning the best practices through professional
training is the other important aspect. BIM technology is linked with many other sources
of data, e.g. costing, scheduling, and materials flow. However depending on the tools
being used such links may or may not be available to a great extent. When the BIM
technology is used appropriately most of the links that show data from the building
lifecycle become visible.

186 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

4.3. Information management
BIM is seen as an efficient information management methodology within construction
projects. It heavily involves people’s perspectives, firstly as creators or collectors of data
from the site and other sources, and secondly as users of processed data, i.e. information or
knowledge from the building models. Different BIM technologies available to date may
provide different organisational capabilities and hence the stakeholders are required to
assess currently available technologies on the market with necessary concerns. This will
allow the organisation to select the suitable technology with a futuristic vision, perhaps
further services that the organisation is willing to provide in the future. Similarly in some
circumstances multiple tools may be required to achieve specific outcomes. Due to the
variety of software and tools being used many different types of files formats are involved.
Here, greater simplicity can be achieved by using integrated products, e.g. Vicosoft and
Tocosoft (Tocoman, 2008), (Tekes, 2008). Since such tools provide various features with
different complexities stakeholders should investigate their recommendations with
appropriate future goals. Quantity and quality management has been an important part of
such product listings. Quantity data can also assist the appropriate site management feature,
e.g. site safety and minimising onsite storage. Costing and scheduling can provide timely
project completions with maximum profits/savings.
Overall, successful adoption of BIM should incorporate strategies considering technology,
process and people. As indicated in the concept map, technology, process and people
aspects can be covered under i) organisation culture, ii) education and training and iii)
information management headings. However, each category implies different strategies to
the BIM implementation. Therefore, complementary strategies should be adopted
coherently, which can be characterised as people oriented, information and process driven.

5. The case study project of BIM adoption
This case study BIM adoption and implementation has been undertaken under a DTI funded
Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) scheme. It aims not only to implement BIM and
therefore assess the degree of the successful implementation, but rather to position this within
the context of value-add offerings that can help the company place itself at the high-end
knowledge-based terrain of the sector. Therefore, it adopts a socio-technical view of BIM
implementation in that it does not only consider the implementation of technology but also
considers the socio-cultural environment that provides the context for its implementation.

5.1. The case study company: John McCall’s Architects (JMA)
The company was established in 1991 in Liverpool in the UK, and has been involved in
architecture and construction for more than 17 years designing buildings throughout
Northwest England. Focusing primarily on social housing and regeneration, private housing
and one off homes and large extensions, the company is known for good quality,
economical, environmentally sustainable design. JMA works with many stakeholders from

A System Engineering Perspective to Knowledge Transfer: A Case Study Approach of BIM Adoption 187

the design through to building construction process and the associated information is very
fragmented. Projects in which JMA are involved are typically of 2½ years duration,
involving many stakeholders and requiring considerable interoperability of documentation
and dynamic information.

5.2. BIM implementation and adoption strategy for JMA
Based on the vision in the KTP project and taking into considerations in the scoping study in
section 2 for successful BIM implementation and reengineering JMA’s processes, the
following strategies are employed;




Soft system methodology, for user led system implementation
Information engineering, predominantly data driven
Process innovation, driven by processes and technology

The priorities and focus in the BIM implementation change through the BIM adoption
process. Further, from the scoping study, it is confirmed that the BIM implementation
strategy should be comprehensive enough to coherently consider people, process and
technology parameters. Therefore, a combination of human centred, information and
process driven system implementation strategies have been employed in the project.

5.2.1. Soft System Methodology (SSM)
SSM comprises seven steps, which underpin the methodology (Checkland and Poulter,
2010). These are
Step 1. a problem situation is acknowledged in its unstructured form
Step 2. the problem situation is expressed (this often entails the development of a ‘rich
picture’)
Step 3. root definitions of relevant system are provided
Step 4. conceptual models of the purposeful activities are developed
Step 5. the conceptual models are compared with the real world
Step 6. changes are proposed- these should be systematically desirable but culturally
feasible and
Step 7. action to improve the situation is taken

5.2.2. Information Engineering (IE)
Information engineering is a methodology to successfully indentify the underlying nature
and structure of an organisation’s data as a stable basis from which to build information
systems. In other words, IE approach is to arrange the data in a structured framework and
store them in a data bank which provides an easy means to access the data. However, that
does not mean that IE does not take into account processes. In fact, it does recognise that
processes have to be included in detail in the development of information systems. It
balances the modelling of data and processes as appropriate (Betts, 1999).

188 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

This methodology commences with a top-down approach and begins with a top
management overview of the enterprise as a whole. This enables an overall strategic
approach to be adopted. As the steps are carried out in an iterative manner, more and
more details are derived and decisions are made for continuous development (Finkelstein,
1992).

5.2.3. Process Innovation (PI)
Process innovation is a methodology which ties Business Process Redesign (BPR) with
Information Systems (IS) or Information Technologies (IT). Importantly, PI is an approach
to information systems which takes into account strategic aspects of BPR. The essence of
BPR is a radical change in the way in which organisations perform business activities
(Voss, 2006).
The fundamental rethinking and radical redesign of business process to achieve dramatic
improvements in critical, contemporary measures of performance, such as cost, quality, and
service and speed. Redesign determines what an organisation should do, how it should do,
and what its concerns should be as opposed to what they currently are. Emphasis is placed
on the business processes and therefore IS/IT enables the change, and also encompasses
managerial behaviour, work patterns and organisational structure (Grint & Willcocks, 2007).
The following steps of process redesign are crucial to the success of re-engineering processes
with IT (Betts, 1999).
Step 1. the organisational strengths and weaknesses need to be identified, along with the
market analysis for opportunities and threats.
Step 2. identification of the processes to be reengineered. Processes, which are of high
impact, of great strategic relevance or presently conflict with the business vision, are
selected for consideration and a priority attached to them.
Step 3. understanding and measuring existing processes. The present processes must be
documented. This will help to establish shared understanding and also help to
understand the magnitude of change and the associated tasks. Understanding the
existing problems should help ensure that they are not repeated. It also provides
measures, which can be used as based for future improvements.
Step 4. identification of IT levers that will help push the changes: This methodology
proposes that an awareness of IT capabilities can influence process redesign and should
be considered at the early stages.
Step 5. Design and build prototype of the new process: in this final stage, the process is
designed and the prototype built through successive iterations.

5.3. BIM adoption and implementation process
BIM implementation and adoption is planned through the stages summarized in Table 1
below. However, in practice these stages are carried out in accordance with the

The stages and the activities within those stages are mapped out with the implementation
strategies in the table below and explained accordingly.

5.3.1. Detail review and analysis of current practice
1.

Production of Current Process Flowcharts

Firstly the methods of communication in the organization were analyzed and flow diagrams
produced. The main methodology for mapping the current process workflow was the
contextual design technique (Beyer & Holtzblatt, 1998), which prescribes modelling
techniques such as flow diagrams, sequence diagrams, artefact modelling, and physical
environment modelling and culture modelling to understand and examine the current
practice, needs and requirements for improvement via contextual inquiry. For example, the
communication flow diagrams in pictorial nature were made easily legible and formed a
good basis for discussions and interviews with the members of staff and obtained feedback
from them. As part of the contextual design approach as a methodology, storyboarding
technique was adopted to find out how the members of staff carried out their activities at
John McCall Architects and identify the correct needs and user requirements through
contextual inquiry: This was undertaken by a series of interviews of members of staff in
their working situation where possible examples and demonstrations were asked for.
Flowcharts and rich picture diagrams by storyboarding were produced from the
investigations (Aouad & Arayici, 2010).
2.

Review of overall ICT systems in the company

The IT System at John McCall Architects is integral with the production processes
undertaken by the practice. The standard server PC (Personal Computer) model was
adopted with intranet connections. The software adopted can be broken up by usage such as
document production, presentation production and drawing and graphic production.
Bespoke software is used for accounting and resource monitoring processes. All the
different software result in a lot of duplication of data in different file formats. In some cases
the data is fragmented such as reference files to allow multiple members of staff to
contribute to one drawing or brochure.
Unifying all activities is a standard electronic filing system. Packaging and transmission
of information represents a time consuming activity for many of the staff, who are
generally proficient software users. The IT System is overseen by the computer manager
and CAD management is devolved to the team members. The IT system is on a rolling
program of upgrade subsequently staff skills are upgraded while hardware and software
is upgraded.
With the adoption of BIM and the use of larger files the network transfer capabilities will
need to be reviewed as the individual processing power of the individual PCs will increase.
Most of John McCall Architects work is within the housing sector. This raises certain criteria
that will be required by the BIM system chosen. Multiple house types should be able to be
inserted into a single site model. Ease of creating site terrain is also important. Also the ease

A System Engineering Perspective to Knowledge Transfer: A Case Study Approach of BIM Adoption 191

of working with brick dimensions would be a real bonus. In evaluating the appropriateness
of the BIM tools to be adopted, it is important to understand the present skill set of the staff.
The level of presentational output from the BIM system will be expected. Additional
rendering engines may be used. The way multiple users interact with a single model is also
important. The methods of sharing outputs and interaction with other consultants within
the building team are also critical. How models can be recombined and clash and warning
mechanisms are also important. The level of support and training provided by the software
vendor also needs to be considered. The other question is whether to adopt a BIM system
that runs on top of 2D software or to purely adopt a BIM system. Another consideration is
the level of bidirectional interoperability the BIM software has.
3.

Stakeholder Review and Analysis

An important part of the success of the project has been the buy-in by senior member of
staff. However, the BIM implementation will affect both internal and external stakeholders.
Using contextual design techniques how the existing stakeholders interact with the present
process was observed. An area of particular interest was how internal stakeholders maintain
the consistency of the drawing set. An area where BIM could make considerable saving in
maintaining the dimensional consistency of between representations (drawings) was noted.
External stakeholders may demand intelligent or non intelligent outputs from the BIM
system. In this sense there should be a flexibility of output, but this does not degrade the
output to the stakeholders compared with the output from the existing CAD systems. The
primary need of the external stakeholders is to facilitate the built objective. Though the
multifaceted forms of output and analysis from the BIM model is possible, new and more
appropriate artefacts can be created and tailored to the building design process. The
stakeholder review and need analysis has involved discussion with clients, consultants and
contractors. A simplified questionnaire was produced and discipline specific presentations
have been given. At this stage, it is recognized that the full benefits of this project will only
be realized if the BIM process is integrated and utilized by the other disciplines in the
building process.
4.

Identification of competitive advantages from BIM implementation

As a background for the BIM implementation project, a SWOT (Strength, Weaknesses,
Opportunities, and Threats) analysis was undertaken to realize the competitive advantages
for JMA. Since the BIM implementation is a fundamental change, it is sensible to undertake
a SWOT analysis at this time. Through the SWOT analysis, both internal and external
positions of JMA at the current time and in the future have been examined; looking into the
company’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. The analysis included looking
at emerging technology and changing methods of procurement. By understanding the
strengths of the company it is possible to understand those factors that are important for
JMA to maintain competitive market share. By looking at the companies weaknesses and
undertaking a review against lean principles (Koskela, 2003) it was possible to reveal areas
of waste.

192 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

By envisioning the future trends, it is possible to better predict how BIM will be used in the
company. It is also possible to predict for what type of project the BIM process will be used.
The competitive advantages in the SWOT report were identified as cost leadership,
differentiation, cost focus, differential focus and collaboration. BIM has the potential to
provide advantages in all of these areas. By reducing both the time and the effort to generate
architectural information, BIM may give John McCall Architects or its team the opportunity
to offer the most competitive bids for projects. By avoiding errors and reducing the need for
information requests from site John McCall Architects has the potential to differentiate itself
by providing a better service by using BIM.
Cost Focus competitive advantage is gained by carrying out specific parts of the process
cheaper than competitors. Sustainability issue is becoming more and more important for
housing design. By adopting BIM, John McCall Architects should be able to analysis
environmental factors at a lower cost. BIM offers several potential areas for differential
focus. For example, using BIM virtual preconstruction analysis and project production
storyboarding become more feasible. Secondly the BIM system has a major potential for use
in facility management and life cycle management. The major advantage of BIM is by
providing a central focus on the collaboration between the building team and through
integration and alignment of all the participants within the building process, savings will be
made on cost, quality and time.
Whilst the major gains from this KTP project are only be realized in the later stages of the
project, several initial gains have already been identified. One of the potential gains coming
out of the SWOT analysis is the use of BIM models for rapid prototyping via 3D printers.
This has the potential to give yet another understanding of a scheme as it develops. The
SWOT analysis also demonstrated how saving could be made through the adoption of Lean
principles (Koskela & Ballard, 2006). Initial seminars have been given in the office on
“quality” and “lean principles”. The discussion about lean principles; avoiding waste and
focusing on value adding processes has provided a good counter balance to the ISO 14000
principles which are also been reviewed by the practice. Meetings have also been setup to
discuss how the adoption of BIM can assist in the drive for sustainable design projects. On
the other hand, members of staff need to be trained how to use the BIM system and
guideline and procedures will be developed. But the important thing is to engender the staff
with the attitude of looking for better ways of working and the team mentality of discussing
new ideas as an ongoing process development and improvement.
5.

Review of BIM tools for the company

Continuous evaluation of alternative BIM systems took place for a period of three months.
Software vendors have visited the office to give presentations or webinars to discuss the
benefits of their particular software platform. This has proved to be an effective way to
generate interest and awareness in the office to BIM and its terminology and associated
ways of working. It has been a good way to reduce the reservations of many staff in the
office to the adoption of BIM, which has been described as a paradigm shift in the way

A System Engineering Perspective to Knowledge Transfer: A Case Study Approach of BIM Adoption 193

architects work. The more exposure members of staff become more knowledge about the
new concepts, the easier the transition will be.

5.3.2. Identification of efficiency gains from the BIM implementation
The main characteristics of BIM implementation strategy and the subsequent efficiency
gains are clarified after the stage 1: detail review and analysis of current practice.
Completion of these diagnostic activities has led to make some decisions to identify the
scope and the characteristics of the actual BIM Implementation and adoption strategy.
Making these decisions is best facilitated with the use of a scorecard (Malmi, 2001). These
decisions have helped determine the roadmap and the resources required for the BIM
adoption and subsequently the identification of the efficiency gains from the BIM adoption,
which are listed below (Arayici et al, 2009). BIM adoption and implementation will reengineer the operational and IT processes and broaden the knowledge of existing staff and
stakeholders up and down the supply chain

Significant competitive edge over similar sized practices resulting in increased turnover
of at least 10%; increase of 20% more work utilizing a staffing growth of below 10%.
Improved management of the client/contractor/consultant relationships, essential to
support the sales growth, leading to enhanced partnering/framework options.
Better co-ordination, better quality data production and information exchange across
the wide spectrum of information sources utilised and exported to others, including the
building model, technical drawings, schedules and specifications.
Enhanced design solutions developed at an earlier stage due to more time and effort
being available to the design team. Improvements in dealing with design changes and
change control enabling the practice to react efficiently and proactively to changing
client aspirations throughout the design stages.
Savings through improved internal efficiencies and better service delivery to clients
enabling John McCall to position itself at the forefront of international trends.
Development of staff to increase the visible expertise and reputation of the company.
Increased technical staff job satisfaction by the removal of inefficient and repetitive
tasks which detract from the core task of the design process.

5.3.3. Design of new business processes and technology adoption path
1.

Identification of Key Evaluation Metrics

In order to derive the KPIs, it is necessary to understand the organizational inputs, outputs,
and desired outcomes and these KPIs should be as closely linked as possible to the top-level
goals of the business. Specifically with BIM, there has been a lack of consistent fiscal
benchmarking to evaluate the business improvements and gains from BIM adoption (Gerber
& Rice, 2009). Using the diagnostic material from stage 1 and 2 of the BIM implementation
approach, the following attributes are sought for the definition of KPIs:

194 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction






Does the KPI motivate the right behaviour?
Is the KPI measurable?
Is the measurement of this KPI affordable (cost-effective)?
Is the target value attainable?
Are the factors affecting this KPI controlled by the company?
Is the KPI meaningful?

The following steps have been undertaken in the KPI identification.
Step 1. conducting brainstorming sessions in JMA and interviewing the external
stakeholders JMA collaborates:
Step 2. Filling out the KPI design form for all the potential KPIs collated from the
brainstorming sessions and the interview with the external partners
Step 3. Evaluation and assessment of the potential KPIs from step 2 to filter them against
the checklist above recommended by Gerber & Rice, (2009)
This process has led to finalized identification of the KPIs for the evaluation of the business
improvement in JMA and subsequently the assessment and measure the extent of the
success of BIM adoption. The following list of KPIs has been identified for JMA’s business.

Production of detail strategies and Documentation of Lean Process and Procedures

The main approach used for lean improvement in the project is A3 method, which is a
proven to be a key tool in Toyota’s successful move towards organisational efficiency and
effectiveness and improvement (Durward and Sobek, 2008), (Koskela, 2003). For example, it
has been used for i) improvements achieved via storing project support information in the
new knowledge database, ii) improvements achieved in email handlings, iii) improvements
achieved in mail scanning and digitisation, iv) Improvements achieved via BIM based
product information documentation, etc. The Figure 3 and subsequent table 2 show an
example for BIM based product information documentation and for storing project support
information in the new knowledge database.
The Figure 4 and subsequent table 3 also show another example of A3 Lean exercising for
Improvements via knowledge Management system at organisational level.

Figure 3. Improvements via BIM based product information documentation at project levelThis figure 3
above is further explained and elaborated below in table 2

196 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

1.Background
JMA uses Microstation V8i and Powerdraft to produce their production information to
enable the contractor and the stakeholders to understand their design requirements. This
method of production has been used since the inception of the practice almost 20 years
ago. 2D representations are created to illustrate 3D forms.
Situation before the BIM tool Adoption
Elevations/Sections projected manually from plans using construction lines. Schedules
produced manually.
Analysis
The problem is that the plans, sections and elevations generated on a project are not
dynamically linked and therefore inconsistencies between the representations can arise.
These can lead to costly mistakes if they are constructed on site. The process of creating
the plans, section and elevations separately is also time consuming. Using the current
method the 3D from may not be correctly represented within the 2D representations. A
considerable amount of time is spent checking drawings to ensure inconsistencies do not
occur. Using separate representations revision control becomes more of a problem.
Drawings are divided up by levels but these need to be applied and managed manually.
Goals
To ensure that all representations are consistent and remain consistent and accurate when
any representations are altered.
To remove the task of level management.
To automatically generate schedules from the BIM model.
To achieve shapes that work in 3 dimensions.
To speed up the production process.
Situation after the BIM tool Adoption and the Lean Efficiency Gains Achieved
Using BIM software to create 3D models from which 2D representations and schedules
can be generated automatically. Furthermore, construction planning, costing, energy and
thermal analysis, daylight and acoustic analysis can be carried out in a fast and accurate
to ensure sustainable design outputs. Efficiency gains are 1) The consistent and better
quality design outputs, 2) reduction in RFI (Request For Information) and site
management issues 3) Reduced checking time 4) Ability of Staff to use the BIM system
and capacity improvement 5) pinpointing other areas where BIM is not traditionally the
tool for improvement but still requires improvement, 6) Reduced costs, travel, printing
and document shipping.

Figure 4. Improvements via knowledge Management system at organisational level

198 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

Background
Items of information that are distributed through many none connected files
Items of information that are difficult to locate
Some information is not consistent across the files in the company
Review of data from multiple projects is difficult
Time is wasted searching for information scattered across the company
Situation before the knowledge database development
Duplications and multiple files with different file types but containing common data
Simultaneous searches of multiple projects are not possible.
Projects are delayed from archive because important data would be more difficult to find.
Time is spent searching for historic information for future marketing and submissions is
painful and lengthy
Knowledge and experience from past projects remains only with the individuals not as a
company knowledge and experience
Analysis
Some primary project support information has been identified as commonly reoccurring
such as project number, project name, project architect, email address, project start dates,
project description, project castings, and project sectors. The database structure was
developed around these fields. The scope to be covered by the database came out of
interviews with most of the staff in the company and discussion on how different stages
of the projects are addressed at John McCall Architects. Tasks that currently cause the
difficulty in practice were identified and the structure and the front-end of the database
were design to address these deficiencies in the current system.
Goals
To make project support information more consistent
To make data easier to find, save time and money
To make multiple project review possible and obtain lessons learnt from past projects
To flag up error and omissions in data
To keep critical project data available even after the project is archived
Situation after the knowledge database development and lean efficiency gains
achieved
Database can be accessible to all JMA staff to input and obtain project related
information. The JMA staff can also refer to past projects in similar kinds to learn and
apply to their current and future projects.
In addition, lean efficiency gains obtained are 1) reduced waiting time, 2) improved
quality in dealing with project support information and external stakeholders, 3)
facilitating audit and reviews, 4) improved quality of service to JMA partners and clients,
and 5) allows archiving and learning from past projects 6) retaining key knowledge and
experience from projects for the company not only with individual JMA staff.
Table 3. A3 exercise for process improvement via the development of a knowledge database (Arayici et
al, 2011)

3.

Development of the Knowledge Database

The major advantage of BIM is to input to a single information model and the multiple
representations and extraction of that single information model. In the project, it was
decided to apply these principles for the project support information residing outside of the
BIM graphical model such as client names, address, dates etc. For this purpose, critical data
that is commonly duplicated in spreadsheets, word documents and emails has been
reviewed and developed into a relational database used by all members of staff in the
company. This has provided a platform to record, share and interrogates project support
information internally across the company. The particular benefits of this knowledge
database are that information is retained in the same database even when projects are
archived.

Figure 5. Combined model for project information with BIM and project support information with the
knowledge database

Also the database has become particularly useful for marketing purposes. Further links with
the graphical BIM model and other processes at John McCall Architects are also being
investigated as illustrated in figure 5. The resultant schema that is being worked towards is
as to capture knowledge and experiences from past projects and from experienced staff via
this knowledge database in the future.
4.

Documentation of BIM implementation plan

This stage is the preparation and planning of the actual implementation of the new BIM
system and the processes on to past, present and future projects. In addition, training and

200 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

up skilling staff is also planned at this stage. The preparation and planning of the actual BIM
implementation is primarily prescribed by three factors; i) the financial restrictions on the
speed with which the BIM software could be purchased, ii) finding appropriate projects on
which to use the BIM orientated approach and iii) the speed with which members of staff
could be trained to use the BIM authoring software. Particular consideration in the planning
process was given to when and how the BIM object libraries and also office BIM standards
were to be developed.

5.3.4. Implementation and roll out of BIM
1.

Piloting BIM on three different projects (past, current, and future) and Training

The adopted BIM software was experimented on the “Grow Home” project; an award
winning design previously produced by JMA. This exercise proved positive in some
respects. For example, reproducing this project in BIM has highlighted the specific order of
decisions that are required to produce BIM models. The Grow Home project had not been
taken through the production information phase, which resulted in some materials used and
the construction methods remained undefined in BIM modeling for the Grow Home project.
This raised issues about the requirements for accurate and complete information when
developing BIM models. Figure 6 below shows some example views from the BIM models.
The other project undertaken was the Millachip Phase 3 project; a series of sheltered housing
bungalows. A 2D set of CAD drawings had already been developed on this project and BIM
models with associated plans sections and elevations were rapidly produced. Objects were
built from scratch on this project. It helped to match the generated 2D drawings from the
BIM model with the previously produced 2D drawings to observe the accuracy, consistency,
speedy and timely maintenance of such drawings and finally to establish a good
communication with the client. Finally this project will form the basis of the BIM object
libraries for JMA in its practice in housing and regeneration. However, future piloting
projects will be defined once the core training activities for the JMA staff are fully
completed. Furthermore, it will be determined on a project which can benefit from eco
analysis in line with the sustainable design vision being developed as a result of new BIM
led infrastructure in the company.
Those benefits below are also realized from those projects above via BIM adopted in JMA.

Overall, four areas of training were organised and conducted. These are: 1) Basic Operation
Skills, 2) JMA modelling standards, 3) JMA methodology of model construction, 4) How to
work with external parties. These are illustrated in figure 7.

Devising and improving companywide capabilities & documentation of process and
procedures

Continuous improvement is a facet built into JMA’s quality system. But with such a radical
change in BIM adoption, it makes sense to continually review and benchmark the new
process. BIM opens the door to many possibilities. Working with 3D models facilitates the
generation of 3D visuals, 3D printing and linking with virtual environments. Part of
improving the companywide capabilities is maintaining the BIM dialogue so BIM
knowledge and best practice is disseminated around the practice. The BIM enabled process
and procedures were developed. This will make such documentation easily usable at the
point of application

A System Engineering Perspective to Knowledge Transfer: A Case Study Approach of BIM Adoption 203

5.3.5. Project review, dissemination and integration into strategy plan
The process of project review, dissemination and integration into the strategy plan will
occur towards the end of the project. As part of the documentation of the evaluation and
review, this BIM adoption and implementation project will be measured and assessed by
using a capability maturity model at stage 5 of the project.
In regard to sustaining new products and processing offerings, one new product that has
been identified is the production of BIM information to better meet the post completion
facility management of the projects. The required research and infrastructure development
is ongoing to enable JMA to provide with Facility Management services to its clients. In
respect to evaluation and dissemination of the project, a tangible benefits log has been
maintained throughout the BIM implementation project. This will form the basis of an
evaluation report that is to be written at the conclusion of the project. As part of the
dissemination of the project, presentations in different conferences, events and workshops
for industrialists and academics, and involving in exhibitions have already been
undertaken.

6. Conclusion
The progress on the BIM implementation in JMA is ongoing and this chapter highlighted the
strategies and outcomes from the stage 1 to stage 5.
Visit to Finland and obtain lessons learnt from BIM implementation that is represented in
the concept map has provided a good basis for setting the strategies for this project will be
used in this KTP project. It is understood that the BIM implementation strategy should be
comprehensive and employ human centred, data and process driven methodologies
because BIM implementation is as much about people and process as it is about
technology.
It is envisaged that when the project is completed, it will provide a clearer vision and
roadmap with detailed strategies, methods and techniques for successful BIM
implementation. Furthermore, based on the current findings and optimistic behaviour and
culture evolved during the project, it will re-engineer the operational and IT processes and
broaden the knowledge of existing staff and stakeholders up and down the supply chain.
The impact of the KTP has already been realised during the project that it has improved
JMA’s practice: eliminating the risk of calculation, misinterpretation of design, improve
communication, provide interoperability between stakeholders and, ensuring control and
sharing of documentation. This is because BIM is the foundation for implementing an
efficient process and invariably leads to lean-orientated, team based approach to design and
construction.
Finally, the KTP enabled JMA to establish itself as one of the vanguard of BIM application
giving them a competitive edge because BIM enables the intelligent interrogation of

204 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

designs; provide a quicker and cheaper design production; better co-ordination of
documentation; more effective change control; less repetition of processes; a better quality
constructed product; and improved communication both for JMA and across the supply
chain.

1. Introduction
With the prosperous development of socialist construction in China, the tourism is
increasingly becoming new growth point of economy and one of the main pillars of the
tertiary industry. It becomes hotpot in current international tourism industry because of rich
national cultural connotation and strange exotic ambiance.
Some famous tourist cities of China, such as Xi’an, establish the tourism resources
information system in natural landscape, human landscape, heritage, and achieve a modern
tourist information services and management through the advanced network geographic
information technology. Although there are a lot of development examples of tourism
information system, they have various deficiencies. Using of information technology has
penetrated into modern tourism industry. It brings new business revolution for rapid
development of tourism. However, present tourism system is out of keeping with
development requirement of village folk custom tourism industry. Application of virtual
reality technology in tourism not only can play a part in drumbeating, influence and
attractiveness, but can also meet the tours and aesthetic demands of those people who
haven't or not be capable of getting there in a certain level. We can combine with virtual
reality and real reality to make system more unfeigned. At the same time, 3D visualization
and virtual reality makes up for insufficient of space scenes expression in WebGIS. It can
make geospatial data realistically exhibit in real space, dynamically and figuratively depict
objective phenomenon of landscape, and provide new technology for decision maker in
reasonable planning of scenic spot. Therefore we integrated WebGIS, Network, spatial
information, 3D modeling, 3D roaming and multimedia technology to establish the “Village
Folk Custom Tourism Service System”. It can use virtual reality technology to make virtual
reconstruction and 3D simulation for typical folk custom information.
This system is based on spatial information technology and multimedia virtual reality
technology. It can display famous scenic site, local customs and practices, entertainment and

tourist transportation, deeply mine local characteristics of village, build external
propaganda window, establish visualization and publishing platform, achieve systemic
organization and efficient management, promote culture exchange and protect excellent
traditional folk custom tourism resource.
This system can use virtual reality technology to simulate and display typical folk custom
information. We put some data, such as geographical data and tourism thematic, into a
computation module, and make intuitive information. Through the comprehensive analysis
and evaluation, we can provide statistical analysis information for user and decision maker
by internet.
This system mainly includes 4 function modules. They are management and analysis of
village resoureces, e-commerce of town and village folk tourism, town and village folk
tourism landscape display and self-service of village folk tourist information.

2. System functional design
2.1. Management and analysis of village resoureces sub-system
We design the management and analysis of toen and village resource sub-system according
to characteristic of folk custom tourism resource, business process or requirement of
mamagement, system flexibility or security and efficient or convenience of development.
Then we divide the system in function.

2.1.1. Management module
The goals of this sub-system are specification of folk custom tourism resource, effective
management and accurate analysis. It integrated tourism landscape virtual display and
provide folk custom tourism resource data and analysis result for other sub-system. Data
information has been classified and evaluated in collection of folk custom tourism
resource.
The management system has 5 parts according to different stages of data flow. There are
information collection and classification, folk custom tourism resource evaluation,
subsidiary information management, attribute of layer management and system information
management.
The information collection and classification module can put the single information to the
database according to specification data. If there are not tourism resource single data, we
can use GPS to measure the coordinate and manually put them into the database. After that,
we classify the data according to some classification methods.
The folk custom tourism resource evaluation module is used to evaluate the single
resource information according to evaluation model. Then we evaluate the tourism
resource within study area through single evaluation information and attribute from
database, such as folk custom tourism resource density, population density, economic

Virtual Reality in Village Folk Custom Tourism 211

capacity density and so on. It can propose a reasonable management for tourism
enterprise and village management.
The subsidiary information management module manages the scenic spot information,
tourist information, socio-econom, and naturalenvironment information.
The attribute of layer management module can manage the basic information of folk custom
tourism resource, monomer tourism level, different kinds of image and description
information of reflecting the appearance.
The system information management moduel can add, delete and modify the system user.

2.1.2. Analysis module
Analysis module is based on collection, classification, evaluation and specification data of
management module. It contains 4 parts, such as information inquiry and statistics
module, spatial query module, spatial analysis module and folk custom tourism resource
planning.
The information inquiry and statistics module can do condition query by attribute of folk
custom resource. The system can provide search according to study area, number, level
and type. Then it can display and print the search result by image, report and statistic
chart.
The spatial query module can use to do research between the attribute and image. On the
one hand, we can do research for folk tourism resource by roi which selected by people, on
the other hand, we also can do research according to single attribute and highlight it.
The spatial analysis module can achieve density analysis, buffer analysis, network analysis
and so on of folk custom resource. It can support the folk custom tourism resource planning
module.

3. Design proposal
3.1. Management and analysis of village resources
The overall design thinking of this sub-system is achieving data base management of
tourism resource basic information, scoring information, classification information and
multimedia information; establishment model base of folk tourism resource classification,
evaluation, development and planning; achieving conditional query, interaction query,
visualization query of tourism single source basic information. It can provide release and
management service of tourism attraction, tourism facilities and traffic information for
village management department.
In order to simplify deployment and management of system, the logical structure of system
uses multilayer structure based on BS. It is good for management of data and service. The
system can be divied into presentation layer, web layer, application layer and data layer. It
is shown in Figure 1
The presentation layer is public interface for user accessing system. It is mainly forward user
request to web service through internet and intranet by browser. Then the server returns the
logical organization information to user. In this layer, it do not achieve the real business
logic, it is only for forwarding the user request.

Virtual Reality in Village Folk Custom Tourism 215

Figure 1. Design Proposal of Management and Analysis of Village Resoureces

The web layer is under the presentation layer. It can receive the request of user from
presentation layer and reject the illegal request through firewall. So it can ensure the
security of system operation. In web layer, we dispose the netword application system,
which is developed by ArcGIS Server and ADF foR JAVA. It can process non-spatial data
without GIS analysis function.
The business logic layer is GIS server center which is based on ArcGIS Server platform.
Whole GIS analysis inner system is achieved in server. Server object manager can equal
divide the complex and expensive GIS operation into server object container through load
balancing and cluster technology. The server object container can call the spatial data to
complete the operation and return the result to web layer.
Data layer mainly intergrates the basic data, which are from folk custom tourism resource
management and analysis system. There are 2 databases for storing data. One is attribute
database, other is spatial database. Data layer can make a relationship between 2 databases.
The system architecture of enterprise GIS has a clear level and division. Different level can
achieve different function. It is good for full use of resource and maintenance of system. This
structure can improve system stability, decrease system bottle-neck effect with complex
operation for GIS data, increase processing power with high concurrency.

4. Conclusion
Nowadays, the development of rural folk tourism industry is going on a high-speed way as a
typical information-depended industry.It is urgent to solve the problem with the information
management of rural folk tourism .So the chapter carrys out the study about it. It is to achieve
a scientific and effective management about the information of rural folk tourism resources.
At present there are still the some shortcomings: 1. The way of rural folk tourism resources
management is less efficient,updated data is not convenient.Tradition methods of rural folk
tourism resources management are based on the type of rural folk tourism resources to set
up various databases to manage all kinds of folk resources data.The method is of great
inconvenience to add or amend data in future.Additonally,it is likely to result in defferent
types of rural folk tourism resources in defferent information storage standard and causes
much in convenience for the informtion retreval of rural folk tourism resources.the
realization of tradition information management system about rural folk tourism resources
is based the client-server software architecture model. A direct result is poor sharing of rural
folk tourism resources information in the way. It is difficult to achieve the interactive effects
between the tourists and rural folk tourism industy. 2. The developed information system of
rural folk tourism resources integrates resources management and analysis-evaluation of

226 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

rural folk tourism resources. To manage the information of rural folk tourism resources is
for the purpose of better managing and making use of the rural folk resources and furtherly
offer a scientific basis of usage ,protecion and exploitation.the traditional management
method is separated from management and evaluation,when need to evalute,we must be
though statistical analysis software to compute.In additon,the types of rural folk tourism
resources is diverse and distribution of scattered, This will not only increase the difficulty of
evaluation but also less efficient.
To deal with problems above, the main contents of this chapter are as followed: 1.because
the type of rural folk tourism resources is complex, in a great amount, and it need to be
updated frquently, a database of rural folk tourism resources based on centralized database
model is constructed, in which all kinds of the rural folk tourism resources data is stored in
standard catalogs. Spatial data and attribute data are stored in the same database by ArcSDE
and achieve the effective correlation between them.2.To develop the information system of
rural folk tourism resources based on the Browser-Server software architecture model,
management and analysis-evaluation of rural folk tourism resources are closely integrated.It
manages vectora and information data altogether. Types, scale, hierarchy, function, value of
rural folk tourism resources are evaluted by the AHP-based method of evalution and the
results of evalution are get. The experience for the rational use of rural folk tourisms
resources, protection of the environment, the overall effect of playing is offered. Scientific
data which determines the construction order of tourism is provided and improve the
efficiency of evaluation.
This chapter fully studys the ideas of design, implementation and key technologies.the
methodology of development integrated the access interface of database based ArcSDE
which make use of Java and ArcGIS Server develops the information management system of
rural folk tourism resources.The resources of rural folk tourism are Scientifically managed,
analyzed and evaluted.

1. Introduction
‘An apple a day keeps the doctor away’. This saying illustrates how a healthy diet can
contribute to the prevention of some major diseases. Despite the fact that most people are
more or less aware of the importance of healthy eating and the fact that most governments
and public health organisations make large effort in educating the public about healthy
eating, unhealthy population diets are still a major concern. Industrialized countries suffer
from the consequences of overconsumption and excessive intakes of sugar, salt, and
saturated fatty acids on the one hand and insufficient intakes of fibre, fruits and vegetables
on the other. These unhealthy dietary patterns contribute largely to the growing prevalence
of non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes type 2, obesity and
cancer. For example, the prevalence of overweight and obesity in the United States has risen
to the massive number of 68% in 2007-2008 [1]. Unhealthy population diets and its
consequences put a growing burden on public health, and both the World Health
Organization (WHO) and the Federal Agricultural Organization (FAO) have called for
action [2, 3]. Moreover, the first-ever High-Level Meeting of the UN General Assembly on
non-communicable diseases held in September 2011 demonstrated that one of the major
challenges in today’s society is creating healthier population diets [4]. The impact of
reaching healthier population diets is well illustrated by a recent UK modelling study which
found that 33,000 deaths per year would be prevented as a result of improvements in the
population diet to a level that is in line with government recommendations [5].
In the challenge of improving population diets, structural interventions such as lowering
fruit and vegetable prices, increasing prices of unhealthy foods, front-of-pack (FOP) nutrient
labelling or food reformulation are becoming more frequently mentioned as being
promising interventions as opposed to nutrition education (alone). The sustainability and

affordability of educational programmes are key continuing challenges, especially when it is
aimed to reach whole populations. Besides, educational programmes do not address the
strong societal forces (e.g., food availability, costs, merchandising, etc.) that work against
individual behaviour change [6]. These societal forces may be of key relevance since there is
a large body of evidence from the field of consumer psychology showing that consumer
choices are mostly not rational, but merely unconscious and heavily influenced by
environmental factors [7]. This means that, even if people are well educated about what a
healthy diets looks like, they still have a great chance of making unhealthy food choices
because at the point of purchase they do not consider all options rationally and are instead
driven by factors such as price, convenience, branding, etc.
Swinburn and colleagues developed a framework for understanding the role of our food
environment in food choice behavior and for prioritizing environmental components for
intervention: the ANGELO-Framework (Analysis Grid for Environments Linked to
Obesity). The model makes a distinction in the size (e.g., micro level or macro level) and the
type of the environment (e.g., physical, economic, political and socio cultural) [8]. The
physical environment refers to the presence of food in all settings including supermarkets,
vending machines, restaurants and worksites. The political environment refers to laws and
regulations that apply for food, for example Value Added Tax (VAT) regimes or food safety
standards. The socio-cultural environment includes components such as traditions and
religion which have a powerful influence on peoples’ dietary rituals and habits. Finally, the
economic environment refers to both food costs and income [8].
In large parts of the world, supermarkets are the dominant food environment [9, 10]; this is
the place where people buy most of their food [11, 12]. For example, the market share of
Dutch supermarkets for food purchases is around 86%. It is therefore interesting to study
how changes in the retail environment (such as different prices, products or placing) could
be used to stimulate healthier food choices. However, such evidence is currently very small
[13]. The main reason for this lack of evidence is that supermarket studies are complex and
costly to conduct. This is especially true for randomized controlled trials (imagine that you
would have to modify all supermarket food prices). Besides, opposition from the food
industry on several intervention strategies is an important reason for the lack of
experimental studies. In order to find a solution to this problem, we developed a research
tool which can be used to study the effects of interventions in a virtual-reality setting: the
Virtual Supermarket. This software tool can be used to study various interventions in a
supermarket setting without having to rely on a complex implementation process.

1.1. Chapter outline

experimental studies and an overview of participant feedback on the software; 4) an

2. Design of the Virtual Supermarket software
The Virtual Supermarket is a three-dimensional software application in which study
participants can shop in a manner comparable to a real supermarket. The application was
developed in the Netherlands at the Department of Health Sciences of the VU University
Amsterdam in collaboration with SARA Computing and Networking Services Amsterdam.
Recently, we published a paper in BMC Public Health about the working, design and
development of the software [14]. In this section, we will provide some of the most important
features of the application and will give an overview about the working of the program.
The Virtual Supermarket is a computerized web-based supermarket which is very suitable for
experimental research on food choice behaviour in a supermarket environment. The program
contains a front-end which can be seen by study participants and a back-end that enables
researchers to easily manipulate research conditions. The front-end was designed in the image
of a real supermarket using an Amsterdam branch of the Dutch market leader supermarket as
a model (see Figure 1). When study participants open the Virtual Supermarket on their
computer, they see a three-dimensional supermarket model with isles, shelves and a range of
food products to choose from. Photographs of real products were used to compose the product
models. The current supermarket model contains 512 different food products which form a
representation of a normal Dutch supermarket assortment. The program does not include all
food products normally present in a supermarket because it was unfeasible to model all these
products. In order to make a representative product selection, we used numbers provided by
one of the major Dutch supermarket specialist journals and information from the market
leader’s website [15]. An average Dutch supermarket offers about 7,000 different food
products; this number includes, for example, approximately 200 different types of cheese and
250 varieties of wine. The market leader’s website categorizes these products in 38 different
food categories. These categories comprise, for example, potatoes, vegetables, poultry, fish,
soft drinks, confectionary, and bread [15]. Within each product category, a sample
representing approximately 10% of the usual stock was selected by choosing popular and
frequently consumed products. Since there were no Dutch sales data available showing
market shares of individual products and brands, the product selection was conducted by two
individual researchers. However, when developing new versions of the Virtual Supermarket,
we recommend researchers to use sales data in order to ensure that the program contains the
most popular food products. In order to widen the product availability, we created a function
by which products in the Virtual Supermarket could represent a number of product varieties.
For example, grapes represented red and white grapes and fruit yoghurt represented
peach/strawberry/and forest fruit flavours. An overview of the entire product categories as
well as the number of products per category in the Virtual Supermarket is given in Table 1.
The 512 food products were placed in three-dimensional supermarket shelves, making a
supermarket model which closely resembles a real supermarket. Study participants can
download the software on their home computer and start grocery shopping right away.
Navigating the virtual supermarket goes easily by using the cursor keys. Participants can
select groceries by clicking on them and the product then appears in their shopping cart.
After they have finished shopping, participants can move to the cash desks which are

232 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

located in a similar position as in a regular supermarket. The shopping procedure is
however virtual and not real, meaning that participants do not receive the products they
have purchased and do not have to pay with real money. If researchers however have the
capability to link the virtual supermarket with a real product delivery system (comparable
to online shopping) this would be of great interest. Also, there lies potential in collaborating
with supermarkets in order to make the virtual shopping procedure real.

234 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

The back-end of the Virtual Supermarket is designed in such a way that it can be used by
researchers to change research conditions in the application without the assistance of an
expert programmer. Researchers can use the back-end to change for example food prices,
food labels, the placement of signs, and to configure questionnaires. The back-end can also
be used to create different research conditions. For example, research condition A can be
linked to regular food prices and research condition B to a situation where a fat tax is
introduced. Participants who log in to the application with login code A (1-1000) will see
regular prices and participants who log on with login code B (1-1000) will receive the
changed (taxed) prices. Changing the above mentioned aspects works via Excel sheets,
using comma-separated values. The application keeps track of all products purchased by a
participant, the time at which the products were selected, the allocated budget, total
expenditures and answers to configurable questionnaires. When a respondent completes the
virtual shopping task, data is automatically sent to a server and stored in a unique commaseparated value file under the respondent’s personal code. The individual data can
subsequently be transferred to an Excel or SPSS data file using a link which compresses the
data of all participants that are available on the server.

2.1. Have a closer look at the software
The Virtual Supermarket is free to watch and to test for scientific purposes (e.g., noncommercial). The application is available for both MS Windows (Windows 2000 and all
newer versions e.g. Windows XP and Windows 7) and Mac (OS10 and all newer versions)
and is built to accommodate a wide range of computer arrangements, by allowing the user
to choose different screen sizes and graphical quality. Researchers can download the
application for free and in a way that preserves their anonymity.
The Virtual Supermarket can be downloaded for:
-

Windows: http://www.falw.vu/boodschappen/Supermarket_0027_windows.zip;
Mac: http://www.falw.vu/boodschappen/Supermarket_0027_mac_universal.zip.

The installation consists of unpacking a compressed file to the desired location. When
opening the program, it first asks you about the graphic quality you want to use; you can
just click on ‘play’ in this window. Following you have to fill in a participant number, this
can be anything starting with an alphabetic letter (A-Z) followed by a number from 2000
(e.g., A2000). Subsequently, the current version asks you to fill in your household
composition; you can fill in the appropriate numbers here. After that, you’ll find yourselves
at the entrance of the Virtual Supermarket. Feel free to try the program out!

3. Potentials of the Virtual Supermarket in food behaviour research
Key strong points of the Virtual Supermarket are that it can be used to test several
intervention strategies (such as food pricing strategies, food labelling, shelf spacing) in a
highly controlled experimentally design without a complex implementation process. In this
section, we will describe why this type of research is so important, what it adds to the

The Use of Virtual Reality in Studying Complex Interventions in Our Every-Day Food Environment 235

current scientific literature and what the exact potentials of the Virtual Supermarket are in
food behaviour research.

3.1. Research that is not supported by the food industry
First, the Virtual Supermarket is very useful to conduct controversial research. During the
formation of new pricing, labelling, or other health-stimulating strategies, there is a massive
lobby from the food industry aiming to ban new legislations that aim to limit the purchase
of certain foods. For example, a recent WHO nutrition report was heavily criticized on its
credibility because the draft strategy was delayed for a month in order to give the United
States and several small, sugar-producing countries (the so-called G77) an opening to lobby
for a softer strategy [17].
David Ludwig and Marion Nestle have published an insightful commentary paper in the
Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) about the role of the Food Industry in
obesity (research) [18]. This paper highlights the problems that occur when academics and
governments work together with the food industry when trying to find successful
interventions to stimulate healthy eating. The major problem is that food corporates must
make the financial return to stockholders their first priority, in other words, they must sell
as much food as possible. This goal contradicts the public health goals which focus on
increasing the consumption of healthy foods such as fruits and vegetables, and on
decreasing the intake of calories from fat and sugar. As highlighted later in this chapter,
most of food industries’ profit comes from convenience foods such as fast food and snacks
which is illustrated by the fact that nearly 70% of the annual $33 billion spending on food
advertisements and promotions goes into these convenience foods [19] . Due to this profit
making structure, food producers have no real incentive to participate in health stimulating
behaviour and may even contradict this aim. For example, pricing strategies are frequently
mentioned as a promising strategy to stimulate healthier food choices. In a Delphi Study, we
asked representatives from academia, food industry and government organizations what
the most feasible and effective pricing strategies would be. An interesting outcome of this
study was that taxing unhealthy food was generally indicated to be an effective strategy, but
not feasible, especially from the food producers view point [20]. Brownell and colleagues at
the Yale Rudd Centre have argued for the introduction of taxes on sugar-sweetened
beverages [21], but encountered some thorough opposition from the sugar sweetened
beverage industry stating that such taxes would lead to higher alcohol consumption.
Numbers show that PepsiCo, Coca-Cola Co and the American Beverage Association have
spent the huge amount of US$ 70 million on lobbying against proposed soda taxes [22].
Moreover, Vermeer et al. concluded in their study on the feasibility of interventions aimed at
portion size that “The respondents indicated that, from a perspective of responsible
entrepreneurship, their companies were willing to play an active role in combating this
social problem. However, that this willingness was subject to the condition that any such
intervention would not harm commercial interests” [23]. Finally, in front-of-pack labelling
research (see also later in this chapter) there are issues with labels indicating products as
being unhealthy. From the public health viewpoint, there is growing consensus that FOP

236 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

labels should identify food products both as being healthy or unhealthy where applicable
[24]. An example of such a system is the multiple traffic light format [25] using colour
schemes to indicate the products healthiness. In general, food producers do not favour this
system since it could give their products a clear red mark indicating the product as being
unhealthy, which could in turn lower the sales. In general, food producers are willing to
think about practices to stimulate healthy eating, as long as their profits are not affected.
When truly thinking about successful interventions, we do however might want to achieve
lower sales and lower profit making in the food industry sector, especially with regard to
unhealthy convenience foods.
Ludwig and Nestle highlight that ‘Academia's role is to investigate by rigorous scientific
investigation of nutrition and health. To minimize the corrosive effects of financial conflicts
of interest, universities should institute systems to ensure independent review of industrysponsored research, including critical oversight of hypotheses, design, data collection, data
analysis, interpretation, and decisions to publish’ [18]. However, this level of independence
is hard to accomplish when trying to examine the effectiveness of interventions in the reallife food environment. For example, if you want to conduct a trial on shelf spacing in the
supermarket, you rely on the willingness of the supermarket to corporate. Also, testing the
effectiveness of interventions that are not favoured or rejected by the food industry (such as
traffic light labelling or soft drink taxes) is very complicated to conduct. The Virtual
Supermarket does not have to deal with such issues and maintains researcher independence
and avoids conflicts of interest that may arise from industry collaboration. In the following
paragraphs, we will list some different types of interventions that are interesting to study
using the Virtual Supermarket.

3.2. Social marketing
Traditional nutrition education interventions are based on social-cognitive models, which
assume that behavior change is a rational process. Examples of such models are the ‘Theory
of Planned Behavior’, the ’Health Belief Model’ or self-regulation theory [26, 27]. Key
elements in these theories are health beliefs, intentions, goal setting et cetera. However,
often behavior is unconscious, irrational and driven by other motivators than health.
Marketing makes use of this knowledge by nudging people towards a product by using
default behaviors (i.e. the tendency to choose the middle size or the one which is labeled as
‘normal’ or ‘medium’), building on human preferences (i.e. to make it easy, convenient and
requiring low effort) and by using the ‘fun factor’. Social marketing is a process “that applies
marketing principles and techniques to create, communicate, and deliver value in order to
influence target audience behaviors that benefit society (public health, safety, the
environment, and communities) as well as the target audience” [28] Social Marketing is
more customer oriented than traditional health education; it uses marketing research to
understand market segments; positions the ‘product’ or behavior in an appealing way to the
chosen target market (more appealing than the competing products or behaviors); and uses
a marketing mix in which product, place, price and promotion are the key elements. Social
marketing differs from commercial marketing in the sense that the main goal of commercial

The Use of Virtual Reality in Studying Complex Interventions in Our Every-Day Food Environment 237

marketing is to make a financial profit, while the main goal of social marketing is to benefit
both the individual and the society. An important principle in both commercial and social
marketing is the exchange theory. In order for an exchange to take place, people must
perceive benefits greater or at least equal to the perceived costs [28].
Both social marketing and the classic marketing mix use the concept of four p’s to describe
the determinants that can be used to steer consumer behaviour: product, place, price and
promotion [29]. This concept implies that if you want to sell something to a consumer (for
example healthy eating) you could intervene on the product (develop a new type of healthy
bread); on the place (self-spacing in the supermarket); price (subsidy on fruits); and/or
promotion (advertising). Especially, it is important to be aware of the fact that all four p’s
should be ‘correct’, for example: if you have a very healthy, tasty new type of bread, which
is placed in every supermarket and heavily promoted, it will still not sell if it has not the
right price. It is interesting to study these four p’s in relation to health promotion since they
show potential as primers to steer consumers decision processes [7]. In this section, we will
provide an overview of the potentials of the virtual supermarket in research on the use of
these four p’s.

3.3. The first P: Pricing
Price has been listed as the factor to steer consumer behaviour [30]. Indeed, economists state
that they have no idea how to change people’s preferences; the way to change behaviour is
to change the cost [31]. It is true that economic strategies have previously been successful in
reducing the use of alcohol and tobacco [32]. Moreover, when thinking about our every-day
food environment, it is clear that marketers use price a lot to attract consumers towards their
product. Another way to use price is via de-marketing obesity [33]. Social marketing not
only focuses on attracting people towards a certain product or behaviour, but also on
decreasing their attraction towards unwanted behaviours. With regard to food pricing, one
could think about making the relative costs of unhealthy foods more expensive in order to
make them less attractive.
Different governments around the world are considering (or have already introduced) food
pricing strategies to improve the quality of population diets. In October 2011, Denmark
introduced a fat tax. Specifically, the measure consisted of a price increase of around €2.15
on every kilo of saturated fat on any food that contains more than 2.3% saturated fat. Also
Hungary introduced a tax on unhealthy food items [34] and France recently introduced a tax
on sugary soft drinks (the tax of around one Euro cent per can is expected to bring in tax
revenues of €120 million). Moreover, in December 2011, the Dutch Council for Public Health
and Health Care (RVZ) advised the government to look at food pricing strategies as a
measure in the prevention of welfare diseases. Their particular advice was to explore how a
fat tax or a higher Value Added Tax rate for all foods could be realised [35]. Furthermore,
also the WHO advises member states to consider fiscal policies to stimulate healthy food
choices [34]. Interestingly, however, the effects of these fiscal measures on health are
unknown and are some gaps that need to be filled before pricing strategies can be
designated as a solution in health promotion [36].

238 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

3.3.1. Evidence on the effectiveness of food pricing strategies
One way of studying the effects of food pricing strategies, is the use of simulation modelling
studies. These studies simulate the effects of tax reforms using real data on food
expenditures such as national household consumption surveys. These data are used to
determine the price elasticity of demand of the studied food products. Price elasticity of
demand is defined as the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of a certain good due to
a price change of this good [37]. If, for example, the demand of hamburgers decreases
drastically due to a fat tax (price increase) this is considered an elastic good. A recent review
on the price elasticity of food (based on a selection of 160 studies) revealed that food is
elastic and that the highest price elasticity was found for food away from home, soft drinks,
juice, meats, and fruit and the most inelastic demand for eggs [11].
A second way of studying the potential of food pricing strategies is to ask consumers how
they would react to changing food prices using qualitative methods or quantitative surveys.
This type of research has shown that price is an important factor in food choice and that
consumers expect that they will eat more healthy food if this becomes cheaper [38, 39].
Third, experimental studies are highly relevant to gain insight into consumer responses
towards price changes. Well known examples of experimental pricing studies in the field of
health promotion is the work by French and colleagues. They conducted experiments in
vending machines where prices of low-fat snacks were reduced by 10, 25 and 50 per cent
and found that sales of these products raised by 9, 39 and 93 per cent respectively [40].
These results were duplicated in later studies of the same group [41]. Also, they found that
reducing prices of fruits and vegetables with 50 per cent in school canteens lead to a twofold increase in vegetable and four-fold increase in fruit purchases [40]. Other experimental
studies are the work by Epstein and colleagues who conducted a study on several pricing
schemes in a laboratory supermarket [42], the work by Nederkoorn and colleagues on a high
caloric tax in a web-based supermarket [43], and the work by Giesen and colleagues on
taxing high caloric university lunch menus [44]. All these studies revealed significant effects
of the price changes.
While the previous paragraph illustrates that there is some good scientific evidence to
support the effects of food pricing strategies, it still does not give insight into the
effectiveness of these measures to stimulate population health. The major issue with the
effects of food pricing strategies on health outcomes is the potential side effects of these
measures. For example, if fruits become cheaper people may use the money to buy more
pizza. Or, if fatty foods become more expensive people may compensate their loss by
buying less fruits and vegetables [42, 45]. This side effect of food pricing strategies is known
as ‘cross price elasticity of demand’, e.g., the responsiveness of the demand for a good as a
result of a price change of another good [37]. Cross-price elasticity is consequently referred
to as being highly complex [45]. The majority of simulation modelling studies have not
modelled complete demand systems to estimate the effects of price changes on both targeted
foods and non-targeted foods. Moreover, most studies have only modelled through to the
effect of fiscal regimens on overall purchases of targeted foods and nutrients; there are very
few examples where modelling has been extended to determine effects on health and

The Use of Virtual Reality in Studying Complex Interventions in Our Every-Day Food Environment 239

disease [36] or across socio-economic groups. The same issue applies to experimental
studies. A review on randomized controlled trials on food pricing found that the published
trials studied small sample sizes, were of short duration and also only studied a small
number of products [46].

3.3.2. What type of research is needed?
In order to gain insight in the multifaceted effects of food pricing strategies, it is of
importance to conduct experiments in larger food environments, where people buy most of
their foods, that is retail settings [11, 12, 47]. Randomized controlled trials (RCT’s) are
especially important to conduct because, in the hierarchy of evidence that influences
healthcare policy and practice, this type of research is considered to be the most reliable
methodology. For example, the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia
designated "Level I" evidence as that "obtained from a systematic review of all relevant
randomised controlled trials" and "Level II" evidence as that "obtained from at least one
properly designed randomised controlled trial. Moreover, the results of RCT’s form an
important input for the data used in simulation modelling studies. A recent review on
experimental food pricing research has revealed that only four supermarket food pricing
experiments have been published up to date [48]. These trials include for example the New
Zealand SHOP study [47] and a recently published French study on the effects of fruit and
vegetable vouchers [49]. All four studies focused on the effects of providing discounts on
healthier foods and did not contain detailed data on substitution effects [48]. The main
reason for the absence of large experimental trials on the effects of food pricing strategies is
that those are complex, costly and sometimes even impossible to conduct in real-life. It is
hard to change prices in real supermarkets and it also difficult to find good a good control
group (that receives regular prices) which is crucial for a randomized controlled trial.
Moreover, it is hard to extract the effects of the pricing strategy from other factors that may
influence consumer choices (e.g., branding, shelf placement, etc.).
The virtual supermarket offers a great solution to the difficulties surrounding the
implementation of RCT’s on the effects of food pricing strategies. The software is suitable to
experimentally study various pricing interventions in a highly controlled supermarket
setting without having to rely on a complex implementation process. Besides, the Virtual
Supermarket can be used to study the effects of food pricing strategies that are not favoured
by the retail or food sector such as different types of taxes (soda tax, fat tax, etc.). The results
of such studies can form a good input for policy and practise and can also be used in
subsequent simulation modelling studies.

3.4. The second P: Product
A second way of stimulating healthier food choices is by the introduction of new healthy
food products or the reformulation of existing food products towards a healthier nutrient
composition. One way by which food producers can be encouraged to develop healthier
products is by the introduction of a front-of-pack (FOP) nutrition label [50]. FOP labels can
roughly be divided into non-directive, semi-directive and directive labels [51] and aim to

240 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

provide clear and direct information about the healthiness of a food product and thereby
support consumers in making healthier food choices. FOP labels show potential to promote
healthier product selection by consumers (as will be explained in section 3.5) but show also
potential with regard to food reformulation and the development of new food products
with a healthier product composition. Food producers are generally keen to heave a healthy
food label on their product or just don’t want a red traffic light stating that their product is
unhealthy. In order to reach this goal, food producers are encouraged by FOP labels
towards a healthier product composition.

3.4.1. Evidence on the effect of product interventions
Research on a FOP label (the Choices Healthy Food Label) revealed that this label
stimulated food manufacturers to develop new healthier products and to reformulate
existing products towards a healthier nutrient composition [52]. Moreover, a New Zealand
study observed that the Pick the Tick logo lead to a reduction in sodium content of a small
number of products [53]. When food products are reformulated as a consequence of FOP
labels, this could have large implications for public health since people will then
automatically select healthier products (because the products became healthier). A Dutch
simulation modelling study using national food consumption and food composition data
revealed that a diet modelled to contain more products that complied with the Choices FOP
label could contribute to cardiovascular risk reduction [54]. Second, a study using a
randomized parallel design examining the effects on sodium excretion of dietary education
to choose foods identified by either Australia's National Heart Foundation Tick symbol or
by the Food Standards Australia and New Zealand's low-salt guideline, revealed that
sodium excretion decreased significantly in both groups after 8 weeks [55].

3.4.2. What type of evidence is needed?
Comparable with food pricing research, large randomized controlled trials on the effects of
food reformulation and new product development form a gap in the literature. There is
evidence that FOP labels lead to healthier product development and there is evidence that
the consumption of healthier products leads to improved health status, but we don’t exactly
know how consumers react to the introduction of new or improved products. Will
consumers indeed buy these new products, or will they stick with their regular purchases?
Or will consumers purchase more products if they perceive them as being healthier? The
virtual supermarket can be a very useful tool to conduct such research since it allows the
placement of new products in the assortment. Therefore, the effects of new products can be
studied in a highly controlled environment without other disturbing factors such as pricing
or branding. The software enables to link the virtual purchases with food composition data,
meaning that the effects of new products on nutrient purchases can be easily calculated. The
Virtual Supermarket could be similarly useful to study the introduction of new sustainable,
organic or fair-trade products. Different studies have shown that there is a large gap
between environmental awareness and conducting actual environmentally friendly
behaviour. The same issues apply to health: most people list their health as being one of the

The Use of Virtual Reality in Studying Complex Interventions in Our Every-Day Food Environment 241

most important factors in their life, but still, they have trouble in taking part in healthy
behaviour. While numerous studies have been undertaken to explain this gap, there is no
definite answer yet [56]. The Virtual Supermarket has the unique advantage of providing
the possibility to study environmental friendly related or health related behaviour
experimentally. Will product innovation actually pay of? What is the right price for a new
product when it enters the market? How should the new product be positioned and how
does it work amongst different types of consumers? There lies great potential in conducting
research on these aspects. Later in this chapter, we talk about the possibilities of linking the
Virtual Supermarket to eye-tracking research. This technique captures how long consumers
look at a certain product and where they look at. The combination of both tools shows great
potential in studying the effects of new products in the market place.

3.5. The third P: Promotion
Promotion has great potential in stimulating healthier food choices. Here there are different
types of promotion we could consider, for example, promoting the healthiness of a product,
promoting the price of a product, promoting a new product, advertisements, etc. The huge
amount of money that goes in food promotion each year (in 1999, US food companies spent
more than $33 billion annually on advertising and promoting their products and nearly 70%
of this money was spent on advertisements for convenience foods such as fast food and
snacks) illustrates that at least food producers expect good results from this marketing
strategy [19]. It would be very interesting to study how different type of advertisements
would affect consumer food choices and how these could be used to stimulate healthier food
choices. The virtual supermarket could be used to display different types of signs or people
could be exposed to different types of commercials before entering the supermarket.

3.5.1. Evidence on the effects of promotion
There is a large body of evidence, especially within the field of marketing and retail
research, about the effects of promotions. For example, research showed that people have
the tendency to buy a product simply because it is on sale or cheaper now [57, 58]. Going
beyond that, there is evidence that people react to a sale sign without an actual price
discount. Anderson and Simester found that using the word ‘sale’ beside a price (without
actually varying the price) can increase demand by more than 50% [59]. Also the way of
framing the price seems to be important. Research found that the use of $9/€9 endings
increases demand because people link this ending to a promotion price [60]. This extra effort
seems important since it was found that people tend to remember prices badly and are
dependent on cues to update their expectations about relative prices and future product
availability [61].
Besides informing about special offers, it was found that consumers are interested in
information telling them about the healthiness of a product [39]. FOP labels form a potential
effective strategy to promote healthy products among consumers. As described above, there
are generally three different types of FOP labels. First, non-directive labels provide
information about the (core) nutrients in a product, but leave the decision about whether

242 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

this nutrient content is healthy or not to the consumer (for example the Daily Intake Guide,
DIG). Second, semi-directive labels provide some guidance, but leave the final healthiness
interpretation to the consumer. An example is the colour-coded multiple traffic lights label
(MTL) which ranks total fat, saturated fat, sugar and sodium and codes these with a colour
[25]. Finally, directive FOP labels include quality marks – a healthy food logo. Mostly, this
logo defines a healthier product within a certain product category. A recent review revealed
that consumers are interested in nutrition labeling and favor the idea of a simple label on the
front of pack of food products [62]. There is a considerable amount of evidence on consumer
understanding of different FOP schemes and also their use in the supermarket [62, 63]. For
example, A German study tested consumer understanding (n=420) of different FOP label
formats. Results revealed that German adults profit most from the traffic light label [64].
Next, A new Zealand study on use, understanding and preferences among ethnically
diverse shoppers revealed that traffic light labels demonstrated high levels of understanding
while consumers had more difficulties with the mandatory nutrition information panel[65].
Finally, a Dutch observational study examined the evaluation and use of the Choices frontof-pack logo among supermarket shoppers [66]. This study found that 62% of the study
sample was familiar with the logo and that it regularly occurs that shoppers purchase
products with the logo unintentionally [66].

3.5.2. What type of evidence is needed?
There is need for experimental research on the effects of different types of product
promotion on food purchases. With regard to FOP labelling it is a problem that most studies
are based on self-report; experimental evidence about the effectiveness of FOP labels is
roughly absent [62]. The main reason for the absence of experimental studies about the
effects of FOP labels on food choices is that, similar to food pricing, these are complex to
conduct. FOP labels are mostly introduced nation-wide without the presence of a good
control group (that did not receive the new FOP labels). Moreover, different FOP labels
already exist in the market place, which makes it hard to extract the effect of the new label
only. Finally, it is complex to measure the pure effects of FOP labels apart from other
influencing factors such as food packages, branding and price. It is highly important to get
more insight into the effects of FOP labels on actual purchases, both for research and policy
purposes. First objective measures are needed because these effects may differ largely from
reported behaviour. Moreover, it is important to carefully monitor the effects of FOP labels
because they may result in negative side effects. For example, it is expected that consumers
eat more of a product when they think the product is healthy and also there are also
indications that health messages may be counteractive because people link health with a bad
taste [67]. Stakeholder views are polarized with regard to the best FOP label format [24]. For
example, most food producers do not favour the traffic light system [25] because it will give
their products a clear red mark indicating the product as being unhealthy. Most public
health workers, on the other side, do favour such a system [24]. Without the presence of
solid experimental evidence it is hard to inform policy makers about the best format. If we
aim for stringent food labels (such as the traffic light system) solid evidence is needed to
work against the strong lobby of the food industry.

The Use of Virtual Reality in Studying Complex Interventions in Our Every-Day Food Environment 243

Also for other type of promotion strategies more experimental research is warranted. Most
marketing and retail research has not focused on public health outcomes, but instead
measured the effects of promotion on a couple of single products. The effects found in such
studies cannot be directly related to the effects of promotion on public health nutrition. For
example, the effects of increased sales due to a promotion could work via different
mechanisms being “product substitution”, “forward buying”, “purchase acceleration”,
“brand switching”, “product testing”, or “repeat purchasing” which all are expected to have
different effects on the definite consumption pattern [30]. Similar concerns apply to the
effects of the communication of pricing strategies. As mentioned before, it may be more
important to tell people that a product is discounted than to actually discount it. The effects
of communicating pricing information (promotion) also seems relevant in relation to price
increases; it may be more important to tell people that products are taxed than to actually
tax it [68, 69]. This discussion is referred to as ‘tax salience’ in the economic literature; in
which salience has indeed been found to have large effects on behavioral responses on tax
changes [70]. Nevertheless, the evidence is currently limited to theoretical analysis [70] and
experimental studies are needed to gain insight into this topic.
The virtual supermarket could be a useful tool in conducting experiments on different
promotion strategies and in finding out how taxing, subsidizing or FOP label schemes
should best be addressed to consumers. For example, researchers can design an experiment
with different sales labels (‘two for the price of one’ versus ‘50% discount’) and the effects of
communicating new taxing measures (for example placing signs stating ‘warning: this
product has been taxed’).

3.6. The fourth P: Place
There is growing recognition that our food environment is obesogenic, that is defined as
“the sum of influences that the surroundings, opportunities, or conditions of life have on
promoting obesity in individuals or populations”[6, 8]. Another interesting area for
investigation would therefore be product placement and the amount of shelf space that is
awarded to a certain product. What happens if healthy foods form 90% of the supermarket
assortment and unhealthy food is more difficult to locate?

3.6.1. Evidence on the effects of place
The effects of shelf spacing and product placement have not been heavily studied, but there
are some studies that show promising results. For example, a study found that the sales of
fruits and vegetables increased by 40% after doubling the shelf space [71]. Moreover it has
been observed that all store types (supermarkets, convenience stores, specialty shops, etc.)
devote more shelf space to unhealthy items compared to healthy items [72]. Finally, a group
at Deakin University (Australia) has done some work on the shelf spacing aspect and found
that supermarkets in lower socio-economic areas dedicate significantly more shelf space to
unhealthier products (soft drinks, snacks) compared to supermarkets in higher socioeconomic areas. Besides shelf spacing, also the location of products in the supermarket is
expected to have a large influence on food purchases. This includes for example the location
of products near the entrance, or placing products on eye-level [73].

244 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

3.6.2. What type of evidence is needed?
Altogether, there are indications that changes in shelf spacing of healthier and unhealthier
foods can be an effective intervention to stimulate healthier food choices. However, up to
date, there are no published experimental studies that have examined the effects of
interventions with regard to product place on food purchases [73]. Moreover, there are
roughly no studies on the effects of the placement of products on eye level, the placement of
products near the cash desk area, the placement of products in special eye-catching locations
(including for children); changing the proportion of healthy versus unhealthy products; or
changing the total amount of products available [73]. We expect that one of the main reasons
for the absence of such studies is that those are very complicated to conduct. This would
require the adjustment of a whole supermarket layout which is very complex and costly.
The virtual supermarket has potential in studying such interventions. Besides, we do expect
that the retail industry has some useful data on the effects of product placement in the
supermarket; however, this information has not been published or provided to public health
researchers so far. We are therefore dependent on other types of data collection to get
insight into these effects.

3.7. Summary of the main potentials of the virtual supermarket in food
behaviour research
This section revealed that the Virtual Supermarket has great potential for experimental
research about the effects of interventions in a retail setting on food purchases. The virtual
supermarket provides a highly controlled environment and makes it easy for researchers to
change research conditions such as price, product place, promotion or other strategies.
Besides the four P’s from the marketing mix, researchers could use the Virtual Supermarket
for various other intervention studies. For example, what is the influence of music? Work by
North and colleagues revealed that French music played in a store led to higher sales of
French wine whereas German music led to higher German wine sales [74]. Researchers
could also think of the influence of colour schemes, lighting, adding extra service, providing
consumers with a clear map of the supermarket (or via a smartphone application), the
influence of hunger and thirst, impulsivity, stress and many other things. For example,
Nederkoorn et al have used a virtual supermarket in the form of 640 food products that
could be chosen via drop down lists (comparable to the current form of most online stores)
to examine the effects of impulsivity and hunger on calorie purchases [75]. Moreover,
Giesen et al., have used this similar type of virtual supermarket to examine the role of
impulsivity on the effects of calorie taxes and subsidies [76].

4. Results of experimental research with the Virtual Supermarket
The development of the Dutch Virtual Supermarket software has been completed in 2010.
Since then, the software has been pilot tested among 66 consumers and it has been
successfully used in five scientific experiments among 557 study participants. In the sections
below, we will provide an overview of the experiments that have been conducted with the

The Use of Virtual Reality in Studying Complex Interventions in Our Every-Day Food Environment 245

Virtual Supermarket so far. These experiments were mainly focused around the effects of
food pricing strategies and give an indication about how virtual reality can be used in
behavioural research. Besides, during the pilot phase and as part of the experiments, we
asked consumer feedback about the software and requested them to judge the validity of the
tool on several quality indicators. The results of these quality observations will be presented
at the end of this chapter.

4.1. The effects of a 25% price discount on fruits and vegetables
The first experiment in the virtual supermarket examined the effects of a 25% price discount
on fruits and vegetables. The results have been published in the International Journal of
Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity [77]. In this experiment, 115 Dutch adults from
the general population shopped one time in the virtual supermarket. Half of the sample was
randomized to a condition with normal food prices and the other half of the sample was
randomized to a condition with a 25% price discount on fruits and vegetables. Most
participants completed the experiment at home and they were instructed to undertake a
typical shop for their household for one week. The main outcome measure was fruit and
vegetable purchases (in grams and items). Next, also purchased calories (kcal) and
expenditures in unhealthier food categories were measured (e.g., desserts, soda, crisps,
candy, and chocolate). Before entering the Virtual Supermarket, participants were asked
some background variables including: sex; age; ethnicity; household composition; degree of
being responsible for the groceries; weekly food budget; education level; employment
status; and household income. Results of this experiment revealed that the group in the 25%
price discount condition purchased nearly 1 kilogram of fruits plus vegetables more for their
household for one week compared to the group that received normal food prices (p<.05).
Differences between both research conditions for fruit (B=481; 95% CI: -69, 1,030; p=.09) and
vegetable purchases (B=504; 95%CI: -64, 1071; p=.08) separately also showed large
differences, but these were not statistically significant.
Furthermore, both groups purchased an equal number of food items and an equal amount
of calories, indicating that participants in the discount condition did not spend the money
they saved from the discounts on other foods than fruits and vegetables. More details of the
results can be found in Figure 2.
While it is important that future studies expand and validate these findings to a real
supermarket setting, the results were the first to report the effects of discounting fruits and
vegetables in a retail setting and found that this measure is effective in stimulating
purchases of those products which could have major implications for public health.

4.2. The effects of price discounts combined with price increases
The second experiment in the Virtual Supermarket concerned the effects of combining
discounts on healthier food products (no discount; 25% discount or 50% discount) with price
increases on unhealthy products (5%; 10%; 25% price increase) on food purchases. The
results of this experiment have been recently published in Preventive Medicine [69]. The

246 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

experiment contained nine study (three x three) conditions and study participants shopped
once in the virtual supermarket. Participants were sent an USB-device with the web-based
supermarket software, instructions and a personal log-in code by post. Every participant was
asked to conduct a typical shop for their household for one week. Data of in total 117
participants were included in the statistical analysis. Results revealed that the discounts were
effective in stimulating healthier food purchases; participants that received a 50% discount
purchased significantly more healthy foods than participants with no discount (mean
difference was 6.62 items) or a 25% discount (mean difference was 4.87 items). However,
higher price discounts were also associated with more food purchases overall (including
unhealthier products). Participants that received a 50% price discount purchased in total 10.4
more food items compared to the participants that received no discount. Moreover, the 50%
discount group purchased 10,505 more calories (kcal) for their household for one week
compared to the group with no discount (p=.001). We did not find an effect of the price
increases on food purchases. Also we did not find that participants in the study conditions
with price increases on unhealthy foods purchased less food products, nor that the effects of
the discounts (extra calories) were balanced by the price increases. To our knowledge, this is
the first study examining both separate and simultaneous effects of multiple price discounts
and price increases in a retail environment. Different authors have emphasized the importance
of such studies [11, 12]. This study therefore provides important new evidence into the
effectiveness of varying price discount and price increase schemes on food purchases. An
important aspect to consider is that our results may be an underestimation of price strategies
in practice, because the pricing strategies were silent. As mentioned earlier in this chapter; it
may be more important to tell people that a price has changed (either increased or decreased)
than actually changing the price [57, 58, 68]. It is therefore important to validate our results in a
real supermarket setting and to include the effects of communication strategies. Finally, it
would be interesting to study the effects of higher tax levels (25% onwards) since different
studies have revealed that such high levels are required to result in behaviour change[42, 76].
The virtual supermarket could also be a useful instrument to study such effects as well.

4.3. The effects of price discounts in combination with sales and promotion
signs
The third virtual supermarket experiment studied the effects of different signs (‘healthy
choice’, ‘sale’ and ‘sale & healthy choice’) in combination with price discounts (10%; 25% and
50%) on healthy foods on food purchases. The results of this experiment have been submitted
for publication [78]. The experiment contained nine study conditions (three x three) and study
participants shopped once in the virtual supermarket. The types of signs were chosen to
segregate the effects of pointing out that a product was either on sale, healthy, or both. The
signs were placed noticeably next to the healthier products in the web-based supermarket
(Figure 3). Healthy products were defined following the Choices front-of-pack nutrition label
criteria which are based on the international WHO recommendations regarding saturated fat,
trans fat, sodium, and added sugar [16]. Main outcome measures were: healthy and unhealthy
food items (number and proportion); fruit and vegetables (gram); and calories (kcal). All
outcomes were measured per household per week. The final study sample included n=109

The Use of Virtual Reality in Studying Complex Interventions in Our Every-Day Food Environment 247

participants and differences between conditions were tested using two-way factorial
ANCOVA, where factor 1 indicated the level of discount and level 2 the promotion sign. In
line with the previous experiments, the results of this experiment showed that discounts are
effective in stimulating healthy food purchases. We did however not observe significant
differences between the effects of the sales signs. A limitation of this study was that it did not
include a condition with no promotion sign, which makes it hard to separate the pricing and
the promotion effects. It is interesting to examine this in more detail in future studies.

Figure 2. Results of experiment 1 in the virtual supermarket: difference in purchased amounts of fruit
and vegetables (in grams per household per week) between the experimental group (25% discount on
fruits and vegetables) and the control group (normal food prices)

4.4. Unpublished results
The results of the fourth and fifth experiment in the virtual supermarket have not been
published and fully analysed yet. The first of these experiments studied the effects of a tax
measure on sugar-sweetened beverages. This pricing measure has particular interest in the
United States and also France recently implemented a soda tax. The experiment we
conducted contained two study conditions: one with normal prices and one with a tax
increase on sugar-sweetened beverages from the regular 6% to the high tax level of 19%
(which is the same as the Dutch tax level for alcohol). Table 2 gives an overview of the
control and experimental prices. 94 Participants were included in statistical analysis. Results
of initial analysis showed promising effects of such a tax on the purchase of sugar
sweetened beverages and are expected to be published next year. The second of these
experiments studied how different discount percentages on healthier foods affected food
purchases. In this experiment we asked participants to shop four times in the virtual
supermarket. During every shopping event participants were provided with different prices
on healthier food products (no discount; 10% discount; 25% discount and 50% discount).
Participants received the price discounts in different orders and were not informed about
the price changes. The data of this experiment have not been analysed yet, but they promise
to provide valuable new information because they can give insight into the effects of price
changes both within and between consumers and also show which discount percentage is
needed to find significant results.

5. Participant feedback on the Virtual Supermarket software
Besides the primary outcome measures on food purchases, the Virtual Supermarket also
enables to review how participants experienced the software. In all five experiments, we
measured participant feedback with a list of questions. It was observed that this feedback
was generally very good. For example, in experiment 1, it was observed that 91% of the
participants scored ≥ 4 (scale 1-5) on comprehension of the software. Furthermore, 87%
scored ≥4 on the question asking whether they could envision doing their normal groceries
using the web-based supermarket. Finally, 80% scored ≥4 on the question asking whether
their purchases at the web-based supermarket gave a good indication for their normal
groceries [77]. In experiment 3, we found comparable results showing that ninety-one
percent of the participants scored ≥5 (1=lowest; 7=highest) on comprehension of the
software. Furthermore, 85% scored ≥5 on the question asking whether their experimental
groceries corresponded with their regular groceries and 94% scored ≥5 on the question
asking whether the products in the web-based supermarket were good recognizable [69].
The virtual supermarket was also pilot-tested among 66 consumers as described in our
paper in BMC Public Health [14]. Results (see also Figure 4) of this pilot study revealed that
the majority of respondents considered the Virtual Supermarket easy to understand (n = 55
agree, n = 7 neutral, n = 4 disagree) and could easily find their way around the Virtual
Supermarket (n = 48 agree, n = 11 neutral, n = 7 disagree). Around half of the respondents
agreed that the Virtual Supermarket had a sufficient variety of products in stock (n = 37
agree, n = 14 neutral, n = 15 disagree), and thought that the stock of the Virtual Supermarket
resembled the stock of a real supermarket (n = 34 agree, n = 11 neutral, n = 21 disagree).
Moreover, most respondents indicated that the products they selected in the Virtual
Supermarket corresponded to their normal weekly groceries (n = 52 agree, n = 7 neutral, n =7
disagree).
The experimental results and the results from the pilot study show that the Virtual
Supermarket is a good-quality tool to measure shopping behaviour. Study participants state
that they can envision doing a typical grocery shop using the software and most participants
indicate that their virtual groceries correspond well with their regular groceries. Especially
when combined with other methodologies to unravel the effects of interventions in the
supermarket environment (simulation studies, questionnaires, experiments in smaller
settings), the results can provide imperative insight in the effects of different intervention
strategies. Especially since electronic shopping is becoming increasingly common these
days. Moreover, there is evidence that peoples’ virtual behavior largely corresponds with
their actual behavior. Sharpe et al. (2008) validated food and beverage choices made in a
virtual road trip survey by comparing those choices with choices made in a real McDonalds
a week later. The authors concluded that peoples’ simulated purchasing behavior is highly
predictive of their real behavior [79].Virtual shopping behaviour may thus also be fairly
comparable to real-life shopping behaviour. A point for improvement would be the number
of products that is available in the Virtual Supermarket since some participants indicated
that the product variety was low. Besides, it could be valuable to provide participants with a

250 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

map of the supermarket showing them which products are available and where they are
located; more than half of the participants in the pilot study indicated that they could not
easily find all products [14].

represents the number of participants that fitted in that category. For a more detailed overview see [14]

6. What’s next: Upcoming research and an English language version of
the Virtual Supermarket
The virtual supermarket has successfully been used in several experimental studies and
shows great potential for further food choice studies. In order to ensure that the quality of
the software is high and to enable the use of the software outside the Netherlands, we are
currently working on new research. This research encompasses the validation of the
software and the development of a New Zealand version of the virtual supermarket.

6.1. Validation of the virtual supermarket
An important limitation of the virtual supermarket in food choice research is that the found
effects may be different compared to a real supermarket. Behaviour in a real setting may
differ from a virtual setting because real life concerns real money and real products and this
may lead virtual shopping to be taken less seriously. It is therefore of major importance to
validate the Virtual Supermarket against real-life food purchases.

The Use of Virtual Reality in Studying Complex Interventions in Our Every-Day Food Environment 251

In the Netherlands, we are conducting a virtual supermarket validation study at this
moment. In this study, we have asked study participants to conduct a typical weekly shop at
the Virtual Supermarket and subsequently to collect their (real) grocery receipts from the
following week. We aim to collect data for around 100 study participants. The data from this
study will be used to analyse to what extend the virtual and the real purchases overlap and
how this varies across different food categories. Next, we will measure which products were
purchased in real life but for which no good alternative was available in the virtual
supermarket. Moreover, participants will be given a set of questions asking about the
quality of the software and whether or not they missed any products. We aim to finish data
collection in April 2012 and expect the results to be published early 2013. We aim to update
the software based on the results of this validation study.

6.2. New Zealand Virtual Supermarket
At the National Institute for Health Innovation (NIHI), the University of Auckland, New
Zealand we are working on a New Zealand version of the Virtual Supermarket at this
moment. This version will contain more product items compared to the Dutch version and
will contain many new features.
The New Zealand version will enclose an assortment that is representative for an average
New Zealand supermarket. The product selection will be based on the products that are
available in a regular supermarket and we aim to enclose around 1,500 products (this is
three times more than the Dutch version). In contrast to the Dutch version, The New
Zealand Virtual Supermarket will contain different brands. In order to select the most
popular products from each product category we use data from the Australian Grocery
Guide. This guide gives an overview of market sizes and market shares of all retail products
in Australia. While Australian data may differ somewhat from New Zealand, the guide does
provide a good starting point for product selection. Other features of the New Zealand
version include that it will have signs at each isle indicating what product categories are
located there. Moreover, we will incorporate a function that enables to select fruits and
vegetables per gram (instead of per package) and we will enable participants to set their
own shopping budget based on their normal expenditures.
After finishing the virtual supermarket software, we will initially test it among the
University staff. Based on this internal feedback, we will create an updated version of the
software. The next step is to validate the New Zealand virtual supermarket and test it
among New Zealand consumers. For this purpose we will conduct a study in which we ask
a selection of study participants to conduct a typical shop at the virtual supermarket. After
their shop, they will be asked a set of questions about the software, for example, about the
product assortment or the easiness of navigation. Besides, we will use insights from
previous work on perceptions of virtual environments by measuring level of presence and
realism (e.g., the feeling of being there). Also, we will ask participants to collect their grocery
receipts from the past week and compare their real groceries with the virtual ones. The
software will be updated based on the results of this validation study. We aim to finalize the

252 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

New Zealand Virtual Supermarket software by the end of 2012 and we have planned an
experiment on the effects of front-of-pack labelling using this new application.

7. The virtual supermarket as a serious game
All the above sections describe the use of the Virtual Supermarket as a research instrument,
e.g., an innovative way to measure here food choice behaviour in the retail setting. A final
very promising aspect of the software that we would like to mention is modifying the
application to an intervention tool. Here one could think of the Virtual Supermarket as a
serious game or eHealth instrument.
Serious games form a very promising approach in the stimulation of health behaviours [80],
especially among children and young adults. Today’s children and young adults spend a
great deal of their time on video games and video games can attract and maintain attention,
which form key components for effective behaviour change [80]. A review on the use of
games for health related behaviour change indicated 25 different serious games available in
the literature and revealed that these studies mostly showed significant effects on
knowledge, attitude, behaviour, and other health-related changes [80]. The review showed
that there are two primary methods by which video games can influence behaviour. The
first involves the insertion of behaviour-change procedures (e.g., goal setting) into the
process of playing the game. The second involves the use of story (narrative series of events)
and inserting behaviour-change concepts in the story [80].A good example of a serious game
focused on improving nutrition intakes is Squire’sQuest! The design of this American game
was an interactive multimedia game for elementary school children [81]. This game used the
concept of a story line. The story was about a kingdom that was invaded by enemies and
who were attempting to destroy the kingdom by destroying the fruit and vegetable crops. The
children had to defend the kingdom and defeat the invaders. In order to succeed this, the child
had to take on some challenges which involved skills and goals related to eating more fruit,
100% fruit juice, and vegetables [81]. This example shows that it is important to include a game
element in the intervention tool in order to make it successful. It would be possible to do
something similar with the Virtual Supermarket. Possible ideas include to let people make
their own supermarket empire and letting them get higher scores if their product selection is
healthy; develop some kind of supermarket shopping race; or letting people try to see through
marketing tricks. There lies also potential of distributing the virtual supermarket game
through social media such as Facebook. Finally, there lies potential in the use of the Virtual
Supermarket by dieticians or other public health workers. There is some good evidence
showing that guided tours through the supermarket by a dietician are effective in stimulating
healthy food purchases. Within this approach, a dietician accompanies a consumer during
grocery shopping and shows him/her how he/she could make healthier food choices. A
limitation of this approach is that it is very costly and time consuming and it is not feasible to
reach a whole population with this method. It is therefore potentially a good idea to use the
virtual supermarket for these type of guided tours. For example, researchers could make a
video with a dietician in the virtual supermarket or it would be possible to let people shop and
show health messages by the choices they make.

The Use of Virtual Reality in Studying Complex Interventions in Our Every-Day Food Environment 253

The modification of the Virtual Supermarket into a serious game would require some
serious software changes, but it is definitely an idea worth considering. We are happy to
engage in this type of research in the future.

8. The Virtual Supermarket one step further
Technology is developing rapidly and recently some interesting tools have been introduced
in the market which could be linked with the Virtual Supermarket. For example the ‘Carl
Zeiss Cinemizer OLED’ are video glasses which can be placed in front of the eyes. The
device contains head tracking and can be used to ‘walk’ through three-dimensional virtual
rooms. The new devise shows great potential for the gaming industry, but could also be
used for scientific research and could be linked with the virtual supermarket software.
Another example of new technology is the use of a virtual supermarket model by the retail
industry. For example, Woolworths (Australia) is currently running a trial on its virtual
supermarket concept in the Town Hall railway station in central Sydney. They have created
a virtual wall of labels representing available groceries online from the company. Shoppers
can use the Woolworth’s smartphone application to select products from this wall, which
will be subsequently ordered online. The wall features 120 product lines from Woolworths’
online catalogue. Also, the Korean branch of Tesco has recently installed billboards in train
stations around the country which show all the products one would expect to find in its
traditional stores. The model is similar to the Australian one and people can purchase the
products by scanning them with their smart phone. The order will then be delivered to the
consumers’ home address. The Korean billboards have been evaluated and concluded that
the project is very popular; more than 10,000 customers have used the virtual stores so far,
while the online sales of the store have increased by 130 per cent.
A final possibility for the Virtual Supermarket lies in the combination with eye-tracking
research. Eye-tracking technology tracks where a person is looking by using either light or
dark spot eye trackers. The eye-tracking devise works via shining low levels of infrared light
on to the participants face to identify the pupil location. Eye-tracking devises can be
accurate to 5mm and allow great latitude for movement [82]. The underlying hypothesis in
eye-tracking research is that ‘we look at what we like’, and ‘we like what we look at’ [82]. So
far, most eye-tracking research has focused on showing study participants with some
samples of pictures and testing where the participants look at. For example, eye-tracking
could be used to examine how much time consumers spend reading the different sections of
information on a nutrient information panel (which is normally provided at the back of pack
of food products) and also in which order they look at the information. A limitation of
current eye-tracking research however is that it is mostly laboratory based and has not been
implemented in real life situations such as for example making product selections in the
supermarket. An important reason for this is that most devises do not work well outside the
laboratory. The Virtual Supermarket shows therefore great potential. It could serve as a
balanced mix between using eye-tracking in real life and in a (controlled) laboratory

254 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

environment, especially since eye-tracking works better when working with objects on a
computer screen as opposed to real objects [82]. Examples of eye-tracking research in
combination with the Virtual Supermarket include experiments on the notice of FOP labels,
prices, different types of promotions or shelf spacing.

9. Conclusion
The Virtual Supermarket is an innovative and unique research tool with great potential in
the study of food choice behaviour. This type of research is of significant importance since
the prevalence of several non-communicable diseases such as diabetes type 2, obesity and
cancer is growing rapidly. Creating healthier population diets could bring a major
contribution in the prevention of these chronic diseases. However, food choice behaviour is
highly complex and traditional approaches to stimulate healthy eating (such as education)
have shown little effectiveness so far. Traditional nutrition education interventions are
based on social-cognitive models, which assume that behavior change is a rational process.
However, often behavior is unconscious, irrational and driven by other motivators than
health such as convenience or habit. Marketing makes use of this knowledge by nudging
people towards a product by using default behaviors (i.e. the tendency to choose the middle
size or the one which is labeled as ‘normal’ or ‘medium’), building on human preferences
(i.e. to make it easy, convenient and requiring low effort) and by using the ‘fun factor’ and
the effects of interventions. Most importantly, the four P’s from the marketing mix e.g.,
price, product, place and promotion show potential to stimulate healthier food behaviour.
One of the best ways to study the effects of interventions on product, price, place or
promotion is by the use of randomized controlled trials (RCT’s) in retail environments.
Supermarkets form the dominant food environment and are the place where people buy
most of their food. However, the design and implementation of supermarket intervention
studies is complicated. First, such studies require the modification of supermarkets which is
costly and complex, second it is hard to find a good control group (people that do not
receive the intervention) and third it is hard to extract the intervention effects from other
disturbing factors (e.g., if a new product is introduced, this comes with a certain price,
promotion and place). Finally, conducting experiments in the food environment often
requires corporation with the food industry which could threaten researcher independence
and could lead to conflicts of interest. Virtual Reality can bring a great solution to this
complexity by designing environments comparable to real life and using these for
experimental research. The virtual supermarket is a great example of how virtual reality can
be used in food choice research.
The Virtual Supermarket is a three-dimensional software application in the image of a real
supermarket. The program contains a front-end which can be seen by study participants and
a back-end that enables researchers to easily manipulate research conditions. The front-end
was designed in the image of a real supermarket using an Amsterdam branch of the Dutch
market leader supermarket as a model. Study participants can do grocery shopping using

The Use of Virtual Reality in Studying Complex Interventions in Our Every-Day Food Environment 255

this application comparable to real-life grocery shopping. Researchers can use the tool to
easily manipulate research conditions, such as changing food prices or shelf placement.
Such interventions show great potential to stimulate healthier food choices, but are very
difficult to conduct in real life.
Up to date, the virtual supermarket has been successfully used in multiple experiments and
has shown to be a valuable research instrument. The Virtual Supermarket is a valuable tool
precisely because it offers high levels of controllability, it allows prices to be easily be
manipulated, and because a complex implementation in a real-life setting is avoided.
Moreover, participant feedback indicated that consumers view the Virtual Supermarket as a
reliable research tool and are able envisioning doing their groceries in it comparable to the
real-life situation.
Limitations of the Virtual Supermarket include that it has not been validated against real
purchases, that the product selection is not based on sales data, that the product selection is
relatively small and that the current version is only available in Dutch. We are however
working on improving all these aspects. First, we are currently conducting a validating
study in the Netherlands among around 100 participants aiming to test the compatibility of
the virtual purchases against real purchases. Second, we are working on the development of
a New Zealand version of the Virtual Supermarket. This version will include around 1500
products and the product selection will be based on sales data and market shares. This
version will also be validated against real purchases and is expected to be launched by the
end of 2012.
The Virtual Supermarket is a good-quality research tool and has great potential to become a
multifunctional, well-used and valid instrument. There is interest for the software from
around the globe (including the United States and Switzerland) and there are a great
number of ways in which the software could be used. Examples include studies on the
effects of pricing, food labelling, place, location in the supermarket, and even the
modification of the program into a serious game. While the current software requires further
validation, the possibilities are endless and it is expected that the software can grow into a
high-quality research instrument in a close period of time.

Post Disaster Virtual Revival:
3D CG Manual Reconstruction
of a World Heritage Site in Danger

1. Introduction
Cultural heritage is an irreplaceable witness of the traditions and developments of the past.
They are evidence of the history of various civilizations around the world. The ICOMOS
Venice Charter stated (International Council on Monuments and Sites, [ICOMOS], 1964):
"People are becoming more and more conscious of the unity of human values and
regard ancient monuments as a common heritage. The common responsibility to
safeguard them for future generations is recognized. It is our duty to hand them on in
the full richness of their authenticity."
Modern technologies have caused several changes in lifestyles. Traditional functions have
been replaced by new ones and monuments such as caravanserais, houses, and ancient
castles have lost their original use. New infrastructures that are the fundamental basis for
recent developments have posed numerous risks to heritage monuments and sites. Several
natural or human disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, wars, and urban or industrial
development have damaged physical bodies or the authenticity of heritage buildings. As
Ben Kacyra (who established the CyArk to cyber archive heritage buildings through a 3D
laser scanning system) stated (Kacyra, 2011):
"We are losing the sites and the sorties faster than we can physically restore them. It is
apparent that we are fighting a losing battle. Basically we are losing our sites and the
stories as a significant piece of our collective memories. Imagine us as a human race not
knowing where we came from."
There are at the moment 35 properties in the list of the world heritage sites that that have
been identified as sites in danger that need specific attention and protection. For example

changes in climate, erosion, and abandonment damaged the Rice Terraces of the Philippines
Cordilleras. The development of agriculture around the archaeological site of Abu Mena in
Egypt increased the level of the water table, softened the clay soil, and risked the collapse of
buildings. The Bamiyan Valley and its heritage have suffered abandonment, military action,
and dynamite explosions. Bam and its cultural landscape were destroyed by a strong
earthquake in 2003 in our case study (United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural
Organization [UNESCO], World Heritage Centre [WHC], 2004).
However, new opportunities to preserve heritage buildings have been created in recent
decades. Digital technologies such as 3 Dimensional Computer Graphics and Virtual
Reality, Close Range Photogrammetry, and 3D Laser Scanning Systems have made it
possible to make highly accurate digital replicas of heritage buildings. The Internet has
provided an environment to disseminate data on digitally resituated heritage to end users.
Digital tools are a key to saving heritage buildings and preserve them virtually. They can
enrich our knowledge about the past and transfer this to future generations.
We introduce our research on 3 Dimensional Computer Graphics manual reconstruction of a
world heritage site in danger, i.e., the citadel of Bam, as an example of post-disaster virtual
revival in this chapter. A devastating earthquake destroyed the city of Bam and its rich
heritage in 2003. Ten thousand lives were lost and an ancient mud-brick citadel with a
unique combination of different types of Persian architecture was converted into debris. The
citadel and other significant heritage of the city consisting of its urban landscape and
specifically the Qanat water management system was inscribed on the list of world heritage
sites in danger as 'Bam and its Cultural Landscape" in 2004 (UNESCO, WHC, 2004).
3D CG reconstitution of the citadel of Bam began right after the earthquake in December
2003. We joined post-disaster endeavours for virtual revival of the destroyed city’s heritage
using digital technologies as part of the Digital Silk Roads Project of the National Institute of
Informatics, in collaboration with organizations and universities including the Iranian
Cultural Heritage, Handicraft, and Tourism Organization (ICHHTO), Waseda University
(Japan), the University of Tehran, the Razahang Architectural Firm (Iran), and the Espace
Virtuel de Conception en Architecture et Urbaine (France).
The high-precision process of 3D CG reconstitution of the site faced several challenges. The
citadel was vast and comprised various types of buildings and nine residential districts with
a castle on top of a hill. Since most of the buildings were destroyed, precise surveying
techniques such as close range photogrammetry and laser scanning could not be applied.
The architectural 2D or 3D drawings and images were incomplete and several locations
within the citadel had not been documented before the quake. The complicated traditional
Persian adobe architecture of the buildings was difficult to comprehend, especially with the
lack of reliable documentation before its destruction. Normal 3D CG surface modeling
techniques could not replicate the citadel’s complicated shapes of mud-brick vaulted facades
and domed roofs. Our project was part of academic collaboration between universities and
it involved students of architecture or CG experts from different cultures. Thus, facilitating
coordination between the team members and producing a coherent 3D CG model were
major challenges to be faced (Ono et al., 2008a).

We will discuss our research methods of 3D CG reconstitution of the citadel of Bam and
solutions that we followed to cope with these challenges. We will introduce the key results
from our research projects as a demonstration of the virtual reality of the citadel in the
situation it was in before the earthquake struck and the distribution of output data
accompanied by their semantics on a knowledge-based website.

2. Historical background
The citadel of Bam is part of an ancient city that is located along the Silk and Spice Road in
the south east of Iran in Kerman province. The city flourished because of its textile products
that were carried along the ancient routes to cities far away. The route started from the sea
corridors of the Indian ocean, extended to Hurmoz port in Persia, and passed through the
roads of the city of Bam to reach the east-west Silk Road.
The city was also developed for its ecological location as a basin in the middle of the desert.
It gathered water through the advanced Qanat water management system that originated
from distant mountains. One of the most ancient Qanats dating back to the Achaemnian
period (500 B.C.) was discovered north east of the city (Adle, 2004). Several agricultural
products supported the economy of the city such as cotton and dates. Travelogues such as
those by Ibn Hawqal (who travelled there from 943–969 CE) described the city and its
citadel (Hawqal, 1966):

264 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

"Bam city has a pure weather and several quarters. A grand and well known citadel is
located inside this city and it has three Jame mosques including a mosque inside the
citadel. In Bam a beautiful, elegant and durable cotton textile is woven and is exported
to lands and cities far away. The scapulars that are made in this city are very fine and
made from delicate silk. Several other fine clothes are made that are sold in Khaorasan,
Iraq and Egypt. Bam textile are very good quality and can be found in treasures of
kings."
Such strategic locations made the city flourish during the centuries. However, the citadel
inside the city has a longer history. Its original date of construction is mysterious but can be
guessed from archaeological findings, resemblance of architectural styles, and even myths
and stories. Discoveries after debris was removed from the citadel, such as pieces of pottery,
some of which date back to the 3rd millennium B.C. (Ahmadi, 2008), and coins that
belonged to the Parthian period (150 BC- 224 AD), (Armanshahr, 1993) support its origins.
Archaeological findings prove the area of Bam and Baravat (south of Bam) was inhabited
during the Achaemenid (550–330 BC) and Parthian (150 BC– 224 AD) periods (Ataai, et al.,
2006).
The citadel is referred to in ancient myths and poems like those by Ferdowsi (Persian poet
940–1020 CE). There are stories about some parts of the citadel such as an old gate (Kod-eKerm) where a magical worm was kept. The worm could secrete a delicate thread (probably
a silk worm) and it brought wealth and fortune to the inhabitants (Ferdowsi, 1974). There
was also a deep water well that was dug by Rostam (national hero of Greater Iran) and
Egyptian craftsmen in the middle of the castle of the citadel in the rocky mountains (Vaziri
Kermani, 1967).
Some critical resemblance in architecture indicates the citadel might have had a more
important function in ancient times. Some buildings in the governor’s district, on top of the
cliff of the citadel, most probably resemble an important temple in FirouzAbad (built by the
Sassanid dynasty (226–651 AD)). Similar elements are the fire tower, (watch tower for the
citadel), the four vaults (Chartaghi) that held fire (Four Seasons or the ChaharFasl
monument of the citadel), and water resources, like springs or water wells, that were dug
inside rock because ancient Persians believed that Nahid or the Water Goddess was born
from stone, (deep water well in the governor’s district of the citadel near the governor’s
bath), (Nourbakhsh, 1974).
Newer layers were destroyed after the earthquake and older mud-brick structures became
evident with large mud bricks similar to those used in ancient constructions from the Elamit
period (3200 BC–539 BC) (Mehryar, 2004).
The citadel has witnessed several historical events, flourishing civilizations, or destructive
inventions during the last 20 centuries. When the city of Bam was an important industrial,
agricultural, and trade centre in the middle of Persia in the 10th century, it accommodated
vast houses with huge mud brick walls (Tayari, 2005). However, its defensive function
threatened its existence during insecurity in the region. In a fight with Arsalan Seljuk and

Post Disaster Virtual Revival: 3D CG Manual Reconstruction of a World Heritage Site in Danger 265

his army in 1183 AD, the citadel was mostly destroyed; they diverted water from a river and
filled the moat and destroyed the city’s walls. After this event, and during the invasion by
Ghoz into Kerman, the region was mostly destroyed, especially the Qanat systems (Aasefi
Heravi, 1964), which weakened the economy of the city. The inhabitants who remained after
the vast destruction in the bigger city entered the walls of the present day citadel and the
large citadel shrank to its contemporary size. They replaced the large buildings and rich
districts with smaller everyday houses. This event appears to have happened in 1409 AD on
the order of the Teimorid governor of the city (Tayari, 2005).
However, major reconstruction of the citadel occurred during the Qajar period (1785 to 1925
CE), while the area flourished again for its date gardens. The citadel’s life as a city ended in
the middle of this period, when its inhabitants deserted it and created the new city of Bam
south of the citadel. At the beginning of the current century, it accommodated minor
military forces and finally it was registered on the National Heritage of Iran list in 1966.
Although the citadel was destroyed and rebuilt several times during the last 20 centuries of
habitation, no power was greater than nature, which changed the great heritage site into
debris in 12 seconds.

3. Features of 3D CG reconstitution
We investigated the architectural characteristics of the buildings inside the citadel to
reconstitute the citadel of Bam in 3D CG. Later, we studied the level of destruction of each
case of the buildings after the earthquake. We studied different tools that were available,
methods, and experience in parallel, specifically those introduced by the International
Scientific Committee for Documentation of Cultural Heritage (CIPA) to choose an
appropriate digital technique for reconstitution. We introduce the process that resulted in
3D CG manual modeling of major architecture of the citadel in this section.

3.1. Multi-technique approach to 3D CG development
Knowledge-based records of heritage buildings need to virtually replicate every point of
their surfaces through digital techniques. Existing systems for buildings such as close range
photogrammetry or laser scanning can produce points of clouds and create precise surfaces
of buildings. Examples of best practices are heritage sites such as ancient Merv
(Turkmenistan), Angkor (Cambodia), and Rapa Nui (Easter Island), which have been
digitized by the CyArk non-profit organization. The points of cloud data and surface
models of these sites, together with 28 other sites have been disseminated over the Internet.
However, these processes pose greater challenges for heritage in danger that has partially or
completely been destroyed. The original shapes of buildings cannot be laser scanned as they
do not exist anymore. If sites have been photographed with calibrated cameras before
destruction, then CRP can help to extract points of surfaces. The three metric images
acquired in Bamiyan in 1970 by Professor Kostka could be used to reconstruct the Bamian
Great Buddha with VirtuoZo digital photogrammetric systems (Grün et al., 2004).

266 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

Unfortunately, such metric on-site images were not available for the citadel of Bam. Yet an
aerial photograph of the citadel in 1994 was available, which could be used for cartography
to generate a 3D drawing with remote sensing techniques. Although such systems can be
used to extract the major dimensions and geometry needed for the heights and plans of
buildings, they have shortcomings in elevation and interior spaces.
Manual 3D CG modeling was a traditional but effective method in our case study by
enabling the geometry of surfaces from 2D architectural drawings to be created. Tools such
as Auto CAD ® provide a metric environment for precise modeling specially with lines,
such as the borders of arches and the edges of walls. 3DS MAX ® has a powerful interface
for generating curves and free-form surfaces such as the mud-brick constructions of the
citadel.
The site was surveyed before the earthquake and 2D architectural drawings as plans, section
facades, and perspectives were available (Iranian Cultural Heritage, Handicraft and
Tourism Organization materials). Several onsite photos were also available to help
disambiguate interior spaces.
Therefore, we chose a multi-technique approach for 3D CG reconstitution. We exploited a 3D photogrammetric map (which was made available to us under the Irano-French 3-D
Cartographic Agreement on Bam (IFCA) and the Iranian National Cartographic Centre
(NCC)) that had been reconstituted by Prof. Adle and his team from aerial photos of the
citadel of Bam from 1994, as a basic resource to provide planar dimensions. We later used
2D drawings and photographs to complete a 3D model of the buildings both from the
interior and exterior (Ono et al., 2008 b).
Our main decision was to find suitable case studies and to choose manual or automatic
techniques of 3D CG modeling. Manual 3D CG modeling of destroyed buildings with the
high degree of precision and the multi-technique approach we previously discussed is a
time consuming and difficult task and needs accurate basic documents. Consequently, we
needed to select the buildings carefully according to their architectural features.

3.2. Architecture of the citadel
We had to study the citadel’s architectural style carefully to create a 3D CG reconstitution of
it. The citadel was divided into three important sections of a district for the public and
general inhabitants, an area for military buildings and residences, and the governor's
district. These districts had different levels with different heights (of around 50 meters).
There were various types of buildings in each district that were partly damaged or totally
ruined after the earthquake.
The major architectural features of the citadel can be divided into six parts:
1.

Surrounding Walls

There are five defensive walls that surround different sections of the citadel. The first and
longest wall with an approximate length of 2000 meters embeds the whole citadel. The

Post Disaster Virtual Revival: 3D CG Manual Reconstruction of a World Heritage Site in Danger 267

second wall separates the military and governor's district from the areas for the public. More
than 40 watch towers divide the surrounding walls into shorter sections. There are
embankments at both sides of the wall to strengthen its defensive functions. A moat was
dug at the outer side of the wall to fortify the city.
The third, fourth, and fifth wall successively surround the governor's castle and were built
in different centuries.

ICHHTO (top left, center, bottom center, and right) and NCC (top right and bottom left)

2.

Gates (Entrances)

The citadel has only one main entrance gate that is located at the south side of the first
defensive wall. This entrance has an octagonal small yard that is strongly fortified by watch
towers. The second gate is located on the south side of the second defensive wall. A winding
narrow path starts from the second gate, goes through the military buildings, and ends at the
governor's castle. There are two old gates belonging to earlier centuries of the citadel that were
closed by later defensive walls. The gates of the citadel are made of a vestibule that is protected
by two adjacent defensive towers and guard rooms watching over the entrances.
3.

General Populace Districts

There are nine districts in the citadel that were inhabited by ordinary people. These districts
consist of one or more large complexes of houses and several other small ones that are
separated by narrow streets. The houses are closed to the outside so mud-brick walls with

268 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

entrances to houses can only be seen in the streets. Most of the large houses were restored
before the quake and have an important architectural style for courtyard houses in the
desert. However, the small houses are partly ruined and eroded and do not have
distinguishable architectural forms. The borders of small houses are hardly visible and their
shapes are vague. Before the earthquake they were not restored and left in ruins.
4.

General Buildings

General buildings of the citadel that are used by the public are common to other types of
Persian architecture. A bazaar starts from the main gate and divides the general populace
district of the citadel into two sections. A mosque is located near the most important quarter
of the citadel. A Madrasa or school and residences for pupils are located in front of the
mosque. A ceremonial building with a large plaza called Tekiyeh is located beside the
bazaar. Some caravanserais are located adjacent to the public buildings to accommodate
outside travellers. These buildings were restored before the earthquake and have
characteristic architectural features.
5.

Military Buildings

The military facilities are located right after the second gate and defensive wall of the
citadel. There is a stable that once had the capacity to house 200 horses with dwellings for
superior officers. The military facilities also have barracks and a water well, a house for the
commander, and a wind mill. They are a well-designed combination on the lower slope of
the hill of the citadel.
6.

Governor's District

This section has the most important monumental buildings of the citadel. There is a house
for the governor with a spacious courtyard and vast Iwans overlook the whole city from the
top of the hill. There is also a high square watch tower, the governor’s bath, and a deep
water well. The most important symbolic building is located on top of the citadel. It is a
monument called the Four Seasons and it has a room with four archaic doorways facing
north, south, east, and west. The governor could welcome his guests in this building and
could show them the whole city in the south, the mountains in the north, and the palm
gardens in the east and west. It might have had a regional purpose with such a unique
architecture and spectacular views (as was mentioned in Section 1) in earlier periods.

3.3. Types of 3D CG modeling
According to our survey on the architectural characteristics of the citadel, the situation with
the buildings after the quake struck, and the available material, we divided the citadel into
three parts.
1.

Less Important Areas

The general populace districts, which were the largest of the three areas, did not have a
specific architectural form (as explained in Section 3.2 (3)) and the main documentation for

Post Disaster Virtual Revival: 3D CG Manual Reconstruction of a World Heritage Site in Danger 269

them was in the form of aerial photographs. No precise 2D drawings were available and the
3D photogrammetric map could not be directly used to distinguish the architecture of the
buildings. Therefore, manual 3D CG modeling of the site was not an appropriate method. A
semi-automatic process with the help of a 3D photogrammetric map was tested simply an
elevated plan and create areas filled with images of the district before the earthquake struck.
2.

Moderately Important Areas

The surrounding walls of the citadel (as explained in Section 3.2 (1)) were the longest of the
three areas; their documentation was similar to that of the less important areas but their
architectural form could be better recognized. Manual 3D CG reconstruction of the wall was
time consuming and unnecessary. Therefore, automatic 3D modeling was tested by giving
volume to different sections of the wall along specific paths.
3.

Very Important Areas

The general buildings, military buildings, and the governor's district (as explained in section
3.2 (2), (4), (5), (6)) were combined together in a complicated way over the slope and the hill of
the citadel. Documentation for these buildings was available. Removing debris made it
possible to measure their remaining walls, foundations, and vaults and assist the documents.
3D CG manual modeling of the buildings in this category was started in two major phases
of research, from 2005 to 2007 and 2007 to the present, which will be discussed in the next
section (Matini et al., 2008).

4. Manual 3D CG modeling of very important areas of the citadel
Manual 3D CG modeling of the citadel was primarily based on the documents surveyed
before the earthquake. Several sources of architectural information were investigated as a first
step and different types of data were collected. We prepared a manual 3D CG model of the
most important buildings from 2005 to 2007 by directly applying heterogeneous data. We
improved our method based on this experience and completed the 3D CG model of all very
important areas of the citadel by using a CAD-based 3D drawing as a basic resource for 3D CG
modeling. We will explain the processes and discuss their shortcomings in this section.

4.1. Heterogeneous data collection
We provided a database of heterogeneous information as a basic document for 3D CG
restitution of the citadel. Although 2D architectural drawings of some of the buildings’ plans,
sections, and facades were available, they were not precise. Due to the irregular shapes of the
mud-brick structures and application of traditional methods of construction such as arch-andvaults or domes, the surveyed drawings had errors or contained insufficient information.
Therefore, we investigated other resources, specifically images. Immediately after the
earthquake struck, we made a call for participation over the Internet and collected several
photographs of the citadel taken by tourists from around the world on our website
(http://dsr.nii.ac.jp/bam/index.html.en). The photo-database was completed with resources

270 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

provided by organizations such as ICHHTO, NCC, and NHK. These resources included
onsite, satellite, and aerial photographs. However, the photos were mostly low resolution, too
many of them were of popular views, and very few images were of private buildings or
residential districts. There was also a lack of images of interior spaces, no data were related to
settings on cameras, and no photos were available from metric cameras.
Aerial photos were complementary data for creating the 3-D models, which were taken over
seven different years (the first dating from 50 years ago), and those with a scale of more than
1: 2000 were provided by the National Cartography Centre and Digital Globe. These photos
revealed the changing situation with the citadel during the last 50 years. In fact, we
recognized three different periods before 1971 in which the citadel had been abandoned and
suffered damage from nearby human habitation; the citadel was partially restored from
1971 to 1993. The citadel underwent massive reconstruction as one of five large ICHTO
projects from 1993 to 2003.
We decided to reconstitute the citadel virtually to the physical form it had right before the
earthquake struck in 2003.

Post Disaster Virtual Revival: 3D CG Manual Reconstruction of a World Heritage Site in Danger 271

We made several sketches of different spaces within the citadel to find the original shapes
of missing spaces such as interiors or details after questioning experts who had worked
there before the earthquake struck, especially about the shapes of vaulted ceilings and
roofs. This method was practical specifically for interior spaces with no records of
documentation (as shown for 3D of ceiling of the north middle room of Sistani House, big
yard in figure 3).
One major document was 3D photogrammetric restitution of the citadel (IFCA project)
using aerial photos of the citadel dating back to 1994. The 3D photogrammetric map helped
us to correct errors in 2D architectural drawings, to ascertain building heights and dome
shapes, and specifically to locate every building at the site by using a Universal Transverse
Mercator (UTM) system (Ono et al., 2008b).

season monument, (top: 1st from right), adjustment of shape of slopes of the hill from topographic lines
(bottom: 1st and 2nd), adjustment and extrude of counter lines of ordinary houses.

We watched every available video of the citadel in parallel with the map and took snapshots
from the videos and processed the extracted images specifically to reduce contrast and
darkness, and we used the images to disambiguate details of interiors or decorations as no
photos were available. We studied different textual resources about the history and
architecture of the citadel of Bam to support semantic annotations of the buildings, and to
support conceptual representations of 3D CG modeling.

272 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

4.2. 3D CG modeling by direct application of heterogeneous data
3D CG modeling was started by using two buildings featured at the citadel: the main gate
and the Four Seasons monument (by the Waseda University team). Five major public
buildings, each of a different type were added to the work (by the University of Tehran and
Razahang teams). Teams of 3D CG modelers simultaneously used different types of data for
the first phase of manual 3D modeling. However, the lack of precise 2D drawings for many
of the citadel’s buildings made it necessary to use heterogeneous data directly in 3D CG
modeling. Such data can help the team to find more information about the spaces to be
modeled, but it is not always easy to use.
The CG modelers used the heterogeneous data by themselves to model the seven buildings
in 3D. They followed a two-step process:
4.

5.

They superimposed the 2D drawings onto the 3D photogrammetric map, corrected the
dimensions of the plans, adjusted the heights, and completed details such as the shapes
of domes on the roof (which were precise in the 3D photogrammetric map)
They extracted several missing details on the facades and interior spaces by acquiring the
geometry and proportions from on-site or aerial photos and corrected the 3D models.

This process required high levels of expertise in both architecture and 3D modeling.
Applying the two types of data simultaneously led to confusion regarding domain
knowledge on the part of the CG modelers, because they were not familiar with traditional
Persian architecture.
To ensure the resulting 3D models were precise, we checked carefully the models provided
in this stage.

4.2.1. Systematic 3D CG modeling in different layers
A layer management strategy was proposed to name each component of a 3D model on the
basis of the component’s type, its location, and the resources used for 3D modeling. We
devised a simple methodology similar to morphology by defining affixes to name different
layers as a single string. A prefix was designed to indicate the type of building. An infix
specified the data type that was used for 3D modeling such as architectural maps (plans,
façades, and sections), 3D photogrammetric maps, photos, movies, and sketches. A suffix
was defined to show a building component or an architectural element and its location as an
interior or exterior part.
The layer manager in MAX® is a function for organizing and managing objects in complex
scenes. Each layer has some attributes such as colour. Semantic layer management of the 3D
models of the citadel of Bam provided a systematic model with several advantages. The
supervising team could turn the layers on or off and analyze the components of the 3-D
model, or it could make one or more layers transparent (by changing the ‘opacity’ of the
component in the ‘material editor’ function of MAX®) and check the correctness of the rear
of the target component. As each layer could have a different colour, it was easy to
recognize when the components of the 3-D model interfered with one another. The user

Post Disaster Virtual Revival: 3D CG Manual Reconstruction of a World Heritage Site in Danger 273

could also search inside the 3-D models to retrieve specific components according to the
layer management metadata.
The most important advantage of layer management is during the process of merging
individual 3D models into a unified one. Our final output to reconstruct very important
areas with 3D CG consisted of at least 25 models that were prepared by different teams. The
3D CG modeling tool had default-layer naming and if a layer-naming system had not been
implemented, the components of the models would have had similar layer names and errors
would have occurred. We merged the 3D models with correct coordinates of the UTM
system for each building without error on a ground surface model extracted from a 3D
photogrammetric map with this method (Ono et al., 2008b).

Figure 5. Implementation of layer management system for 3D model of Four Seasons monument

4.2.2. Quality control of 3D CG models
Quality control on the 3D models was carried out to ensure the 3D reconstruction process
was correct. The scale of 3Ds was unified and the geometric coordinates of the elements and
their correct positions within the citadel as a whole were specified. The initial 3D models
that were developed by the team of CG experts were evaluated to identify incomplete parts
or components with errors. The interior spaces, vaulted ceilings, or ornaments had problems
due to a lack of accurate 2D drawings. Therefore, the architecture for the 3D models was
controlled by analytically interpreting relics using the heterogeneous resources in the
following categories:
6.
a.

Architectural
Superimposition of different architectural drawings

We superimposed plans of different levels of selected buildings, facades, and sections, and
compared them with 3D models. Displacements were found that confused the modelers

274 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

about the dimensions of walls on the ground and first floor, the alignment of load-bearing
walls over each other at different levels, and the heights of towers. We merged 3D models
with a 3D photogrammetric map based on some reference points. The correct measurements
of heights and exterior borders of buildings were marked and reported.
b.

Comparison with photos, sketches based on oral explanations by experts, and videos

The complicated architecture of the citadel had missing details in the 2D drawings. The
exact shapes of arches, details on decorations, and correct forms for the domed surfaces of
roofs were major errors in the 3D models. Photos had to be used to disambiguate the details.
We tried to extract as much information as possible from the photos using scalable
components such as human scale. We made a library of traditional Persian arches common
to the architecture of the citadel and gave the 3D modelers drawing instructions.

Figure 6. Errors in technical 3D CG models during first phase of project

c.

Comparison with similar styles of construction

Of the different components of 3D models, the interior spaces of less well known buildings
had the least basic information and contained errors. We tried to compare the geometry of

Post Disaster Virtual Revival: 3D CG Manual Reconstruction of a World Heritage Site in Danger 275

the spaces with other similar spaces inside the citadel or inside the city of Bam and found
similar styles. This method was specifically useful for interior vaults. The aerial photos were
helpful to deduce the locations of walls and styles of coverings. Specific instructions were
provided for modeling and reporting the most well-known vaults in the citadel. The
instructions included simple models of the details of ornaments such as chalk bands around
vaults and columns or brick-work decorations.
7.
a.

Technical 3D CG modeling
Selection of suitable surface modeling technique

We selected Auto CAD ® and 3ds Max ® from the different tools available for 3D CG
modeling for our work. These tools have different functions and can cover different
applications. AutoCAD provided a coordinated environment to draw precise lines and
dimensions. Therefore, 2D drawings were first matched together to form initial 3D drawings
of extruding solid surfaces of walls with this tool. However, problems started with 3D
modeling of the free-form surfaces of the adobe of the citadel.
There were insufficient 3D meshes that were formed between four-sided volumes in the
tool. Although newer versions (AutoCAD 2012 ®) are empowered with more sophisticated
surface modeling such as non-uniform rational basis (NURB) splines, the 3D modeling that
was started with the tools in 2005 had shortcomings for our purposes. Therefore, several
initial drawings were imported from AutoCAD ® to 3ds Max ® for modeling.
As the process had errors with some surfaces, specifically the meshes of vaults, the
modeling of ceilings, vaults, roofs, and details were started from scratch with the 3ds Max ®
tool. The tool provided different methods of surface modeling where each was suitable for
particular forms. We proposed mesh surfaces for barrel or cloister vaults that had four
specific sides that were symmetric. Roofs or non-geometric surfaces of the ground were
modeled by using polygons or NURBs. These two allowed a case-by-case approach to
modeling to fill in all the surveyed geometries and the surfaces of arched vaults or roofs as
each room of the buildings was different in its own way.
b.

Selection of proper level of details

3D CG modeling of the buildings inside the citadel of Bam with a one-to-one scale of details
needed every detail of one centimetre or less to be precisely reconstituted. Modeling adobe
architecture with tools such as 3ds MAX ® was like digitally rebuilding a site from mud;
soft and curved surfaces of mud brick needed high levels of detail of their surfaces. This
made the models heavy, which will be a problem when all models are merged and
rendering is carried out. We checked the size of meshes or polygon details and the geometry
of intersecting solids or surfaces to optimize the level of details and avoid unnecessary large
size files.
c.

Control of adjacency of 3D components

Seams between components, e.g., at the joints between facades and interior spaces,
interference by 3D solid parts, such as ceilings with exterior walls, chalk decorations with

276 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

mud brick walls, and similar errors, were evident and checked in the 3D models. Layer
management helped us to separate different components such as walls, roofs, and ceilings
and check their adjacencies and report the errors (Matini, Ono, 2010).

Figure 7. Different methods of surface modeling for ceiling and roofs in citadel of Bam (outer surface of
roof and inner surface of ceiling below it are showed)

4.2.3. Evaluation reports
According to the quality control specified above, we took snapshots of the errors and
compared them with our data by using knowledge on the geometry, proportions, structure,
and scale of the adobe buildings. From 2005 to 2007, during which the first phase of 3D
modeling of the seven buildings was almost completed, we evaluated the 3D models of all
buildings during the development phase at least three times and identified between 100 and
200 errors (architectural and technical) each time that needed to be modified. We also
provided evaluation reports to ask for corrections and also organized meetings and
discussions with the modelers. Hundreds of pages of questions for evaluation were
prepared and sent to different teams of CG modelers (Waseda University, Prof. Kawai's
laboratory in Tokyo, the University of Tehran, Prof. Einifar's laboratory in Tehran,
ENSAPVS, Prof. Bouet and Prof. Dell’s laboratory of EVCAU in Paris).
The errors were carefully observed by the CG modelers and corrected. They provided
answers to the corrected errors and created the final results for the first phase for the seven
buildings with the best possible precision.

Post Disaster Virtual Revival: 3D CG Manual Reconstruction of a World Heritage Site in Danger 277

4.3. 3D modeling by CAD-based 3D drawings as basic resources
The correction process for the first phase of 3D modeling was complicated. Several problems
resulted from the modelers’ application of heterogeneous data and their corrections took a
great deal of effort. Sometimes remodeling was easier than making modifications to some
errors.
To solve this problem in the second phase of the project (beginning October 2007), we
developed CAD-based 3D technical drawing as a unified method of basically drawing the
citadel. The drawing was developed in a sequential modification process using the domain
knowledge and contribution of architectural experts. They could comprehend the
chronology and the original shapes of the mud-brick buildings.
First, an initial drawing for the interior spaces was developed from 2D drawings. In some
cases, we surveyed the remains after the earthquake struck, but in many cases no
measurable remains were available and only 2D drawings surveyed before the earthquake
were used. Later, the 3D photogrammetric map was directly used as an initial drawing for
exterior borders of the buildings, roofs, and heights. Initial 3D drawings were adjusted and
completed through a number of different modification steps. One architectural aspect of the
model was evaluated in each step and modified by applying one or more heterogeneous
data items. The modifications were made sequentially rather than simultaneously to avoid
confusion and the possibility of missing important features. The modifications comprised
geometrical, structural, and proportional changes and the adding of details, which are
discussed below.

Geometrical Modifications

The incomplete parts of the 3D models that were identified during the first phase of the
project were mostly from spaces without information, specifically interiors. Geometrical
features of an architectural element helped us to sketch and modify these spaces.
For example, the shape of the roof visible in aerial photos can specify the geometry of an
interior ceiling or location of a wall. Shadow and light visible on the floor or wall in a photo
can reveal architectural elements such as windows. A symmetric space can help to mirror an
available section. Similarities between components such as niches can also help to identify
the shapes of missing parts of the 3D models.
9.

Structural Modifications

Traditional adobe buildings have limited features of construction. Load-bearing walls are
covered by specific types of roof systems such as barrel-vault, cloister-vault, or arch-vault
types of covering. However, adobe has less resistance as a material than brick, and the
domes or vaults might not be completely symmetric; minor changes can also be found in
different centuries of construction such as the shapes of arches and the heights of domes.
The height of interior ceilings was one of the most serious problems in the drawings.
Measurements based on the 2D drawings were insufficient and some ribs of ceilings reached
outside the surface of the roof in the 3D models.
The outer surface of the roof was modeled in this stage by using the 3D photogrammetric
map. As the domes were not symmetric, two orthogonal splines were drawn for the
curvature of the domes. Therefore, the style for the roofing structure was extracted, and the
thickness of the ribs or vaults was determined (around 12 cm for vaults and 32 cm for
arches). Finally, the surface of the ceiling was modeled.
This process needed an on-site survey. Some vaults were not completely destroyed and
could be measured after the quake. Some portions of the vaults or arches were surveyed
after debris was removed from the citadel and the 3D drawings were correctly completed
based on structural features.
10. Proportional Features and Details
Traditional Persian buildings have specific module of dimension that specifies their
proportions. For example the span of a doorway, 103 cm, is a module that controls the
proportions of rooms. Therefore heights, angles, spans, thicknesses, and other parameters
were drawn in a wireframe model according to extracted proportions. Photos were primary
resources to make proportional modifications. Unfortunately, we could not find a metric
photo to provide a rectified image and directly take measurements from photos. However,
we could use some functions of the MAX ® tool such as camera matching, and could find
approximate perspectives for scenes. Then, scalable parts in scenes, such as floor tiles and
the human scale could be identified and the approximate proportion of whole scenes could
be extracted; as a result, the geometry of 3D drawings could be completed. This method was
helpful specifically for details such as niches, columns and chalk band decorations.

Figure 9. Geometric and structural modifications to make the wire frame of the ceiling and the roof and
complete the 3D CG modeling

CAD-Based 3D drawing, which was prepared by complementary application of
heterogeneous data, had detailed specifications on the architecture of the citadel. The whole
governor's section, surrounding walls, second and old gates, and other complicated spaces
of the citadel located on Bam's hills were completed with this method. 3D drawings were
easily imported into the 3ds Max® environment and completed by 3D modelers who had
little domain knowledge. They imported DWG files into 3ds Max®. Their task was only to
define suitable faces between the borders of 3D drawing lines. This reduced the amount of
synthesis they needed to do for the original shapes, especially for arches, vaults, domes, and
the proportions of niches. In most cases, the lines were given for all details and the only
challenge was to choose proper surface modeling or a proper modifier from a large number
of tool options, such as polygons or NURBS for cloister vaults and meshes for barrel vaults.
We used this method to finish the modeling of 20 buildings and several defensive walls of
the citadel between 2007 and 2010 (Matini, et al., 2008).

5. Key results
The results for the 3D CG manual reconstruction of the citadel of Bam demonstrated that we
finished 3D modeling of every building in areas of great importance that had been restored
and made safe before the earthquake. For moderate or less accurate areas, we tested
methods of automating the modeling process to reduce the time and cost required for
reconstruction. One method that was proposed for semi-automatic modeling was to refine
the photogrammetric map toward the 3D models of unimportant buildings and paste
texture from tourist photographs onto the models (Kitamoto et al., 2011).

5.1. Bam 3D CG ontology driven website
We presented our visual output data as rendered images, Quick Time Virtual Reality
(QTVR) videos, or walkthrough videos as part of the conceptual process of our project on
the Bam3DCG Website (http://dsr.nii.ac.jp/Bam3DCG/). In comparison to the architectural
process, conceptual modeling is about representing our knowledge of cultural heritage by
defining the semantic relationship between knowledge of the domain and output data. Since
we were dealing with heterogeneous data, the data needed to be explained with semantic
annotations linked to various concepts associated with the data. We developed the Bam
3DCG ontology-based Website for this purpose.
To acquire the semantics of the citadel of Bam, we designed an ontology knowledge model
called Bam 3D CG ontology using three major schemas: a metadata-based schema, which
was conceptualized using different metadata standards, a referencing-based schema, which
provided the location or bibliographic attributes such as a historical summary of each
building from different travelogues or historic references), and a lexical-based schema,
which provided terminological specifications for every building in the citadel.
Every piece of information, or visual output data, is an entity connected to other entities by
semantic links in this ontology designed using the Protégé knowledge acquisition tool as a
Resource Description Framework (RDF) file. These links are descriptive attributes of entities.
Each homogeneous group of information is hierarchically categorized in classes with
subclasses.

Post Disaster Virtual Revival: 3D CG Manual Reconstruction of a World Heritage Site in Danger 281

Figure 11. Architecture of Bam 3D CG ontology driven Website

We selected the Core Data Index to Historic Buildings and Monuments of the Architectural
Heritage (Thornes, Bold, 1998), which was part of the Object ID standard to describe the
attributes of the buildings (such as name, location, date, material, etc.). We used the Dublin
Core Metadata Element Set, which is a standard vocabulary of fifteen properties for use in
resource descriptions to describe and catalogue visual data that consisted of photos, videos,
architectural drawings, and sketches. The multilingual lexical schema of the ontology
provides the semantics of all buildings in different languages. We designed a Website
generation and maintenance system to browse the RDF graph created on Protégé so that
people could browse knowledge bases using a standard Web browser.
Bam 3D CG displays rendered snapshots, QTVR, or walkthrough videos of the 3D models of
different buildings, photos of them before the earthquake, and their geo-referencing by
using the UTM system on satellite photos. Their names are provided in five languages with
the date, physical condition, and material of each building, the history of the buildings from
multiple references, people that contributed to the 3D CG process, and several other data.
The Website also renders maps of buildings on the satellite photos of sites that enable users
to gain access to building information (Andaroodi, Kitamoto, 2010).

282 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

5.2. Virtual reality demonstration
We represented QTVR videos of the virtual citadel on the Bam 3D CG Website, which
allowed users to look at different directions with variable resolution. However, the
interactivity offered by Quicktime VR was limited, because users could not move from the
camera location to another point. A more advanced mechanism is to use a virtual reality
system for real-time rendering. We presented the Bam 3D CG reconstruction as part of a
virtual reality (VR) demonstration. The VR space of the completed 3D CG models is
intended to be the basis for future restoration work.
The space was built using the OmegaSpace VR presentation software developed by Solidray
Co., Ltd. OmegaSpace is also space construction software that enables real-time rendering in
a PC environment and can be used in various fields. It can also be extended to a cyberspace
type of system on a network, allowing two or more users to simultaneously use a single VR
file. This enables the VR space to be shared and cooperative work to be done in it.
The model was output in VRML form with coordinate information to create a VR file and
was read into OmegaSpace. The model was lit arbitrarily and two or more cameras were set
up in each building. The walk-through was done by switching cameras with a joystick. We
also added a collision-detection mechanism to prevent the operator from walking into walls
and other objects in the model.
The VR demonstration enabled users to interact with computer-simulated spaces and walk
virtually inside the buildings displayed on the screen. This might be the only chance for
them to discover the heritage of Bam. We used a Z-800 3D Visor head-mounted display to
test the effectiveness of the VR technology for our model.
The preliminary VR demonstration was presented in a workshop that was held at the citadel
of Bam in September 2006. The open house at NII in June 2007 also held a virtual tour inside
the digitally restored citadel. A virtual demonstration was broadcast by NHK in its ‘SOS
from World Heritage’ program in May 2006. The VR demonstration revived buildings of the
citadel of Bam, which are now impossible to visit in the real world (Ono et al., 2008b).

Figure 12. Test of virtual reality demonstration in Bam 3D CG Reconstruction

Post Disaster Virtual Revival: 3D CG Manual Reconstruction of a World Heritage Site in Danger 283

The main limitation of the VR system is that users need to go to places where special devices
are available. It may be useful for specific exhibitions, but this is not a good solution for the
general public. The best solution is to build a system on the Internet where users can
interactively navigate through the 3D model at any time from any place with a browser.
The simplest solution available is to use a virtual reality modeling language (VRML) version
of the 3D models online so anyone with a VRML browser can download the data and
interactively render the 3D model. We could not use this method as free distribution of data
was not considered. The ideal solution is to protect the original model on the server side,
and only transfer the rendered output to the client side in an interactive manner in real-time.
We are now seeking a solution to fulfil this idea (Kitamoto et al, 2011).

6. Conclusion
The 3D CG reconstruction of the citadel of Bam was a post-disaster effort to virtually revive
large adobe structures after its destruction in the earthquake. We investigated several
techniques to create a 3D CG reconstitution of the site. 3D CG manual modeling was our
best solution as the site had been destroyed and direct techniques of measurement could not
be applied. We used a photogrammetric 3D map that was reconstituted from aerial
photographs as a basic resource (IFCA project). We added several other heterogeneous data
such as on-site photos, videos, and sketches to complete knowledge of the original shapes of
the buildings.
We collaborated with various 3D modeling teams as part of an academic-research effort.
There were two phases of 3D modeling to reconstitute all extremely important buildings in
the citadel. First, the CG modelers directly used heterogeneous data for 3D modeling.
Unfortunately, the initial data were more incomplete than we expected, and several spaces
were ambiguous in form. The work of 3D modelers was controlled several times to create a
precise 3D model and 10 buildings were completed from 2005 to 2007.
Later, we developed CAD-based 3D drawings as basic resources in the second phase by
gradually implementing the heterogeneous data. The modelers used 3D drawings as basic
resources and just defined faces between lines to complete the 3D model. This second phase
lasted till 2009 and more than 20 buildings were reconstructed in the citadel. We represented
our results at a conceptual level on an ontology-based Website. The output was several
rendered images, QTVR, and walkthrough videos. Data were linked with knowledge of the
buildings and represented their history, material, and locations.
The virtual reality (VR) demonstrations of the reconstructed buildings were presented
inside the OmegaSpace tool, and were viewed with an HMD in 3D by several visitors of
buildings that had been destroyed and did not exist in the real world.
Our future work is to complete 3D CG reconstruction by automatically or semiautomatically generating less important areas of the citadel such as its surrounding walls or
residential districts.

284 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

We investigated ways of building a system on the Internet where users could interactively
navigate through a 3D model of the citadel with a browser at any time through an online
Virtual Reality system.
The Citadel of Bam is under physical reconstruction now but several locations such as the
Governor Section have suffered serious damages and it seems to be very difficult to
physically restore them. Our Virtual Reconstruction is the only chance for the visitors to
view the site. Therefore a VR theatre that is constructed in the site beside the Citadel can
provide the chance for the visitors to see the heritage in its original shape before the
earthquake. The 3D stereoscopic image that is provided by a 3D projector and viewed on
a wide screen in a VR theatre can present a better 3D stereoscopic presentation effect and
help the visitors to experience a high quality three dimensional walkthrough inside the
heritage.
Another application is to provide an Augmented Reality (AR) presentation of the site with
different tools. The visitors can experience the destroyed heritage and the 3D CG
reconstructed images provided by AR system at the same time and compare them together.
Different VR or AR presentation systems of the destroyed heritage that is reconstructed by
3D CG techniques are the key applications to revive the site virtually and to preserve it for
future generation.

1. Introduction
Initially, the main applications of virtual reality (VR) included various walkthroughs with
real-time graphics. At present, VR applications have been extended to various fields
including telecommunications, training, scientific exploration, collaborative work activities,
and entertainment. In particular, in the entertainment field, not only VR but also mixed
reality (MR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies are actively used for human–machine
interfaces in application building. For example, a number of major amusement parks
operate amazing VR rides, and numerous museum exhibits have interactive installations
using VR/MR/AR technologies.
In addition, the factor of entertainment is currently adopted in education and skill
development applications. LEGO® mindstorms® provides an excellent learning environment
for engineering and programming subjects. It promotes self-learning of basic computing
logic and machinery mechanisms while having fun. The term “edutainment” is used to
indicate video games that teach players by a game-based learning approach. For example,
players can learn about a historical background by playing simulation games such as
Civilization and Nobunaga’s Ambition. Serious games are developed as educational tools and
mainly focus on teaching rather than entertaining. Gamification is a framework used to
apply game design methods to nongame matters. Foursquare, which is a location-based
SNS, is an example of gamification. Concerning rehabilitation, there are many computerbased programs that encourage rehabilitation while playing games or singing songs along
with hand gestures.
The common theme among such programs is “motivation.” Motivation is the reason why
people act or behave in a particular manner1. It is important to determine the method to
motivate people faced with a tedious task or those unwilling to work. “The Fun Theory2”

holds that something as simple as “fun” is the easiest way to change people’s behavior for
the better. For example, the “Piano Staircase” project installed a giant piano keyboard
covering the stairs leading out of a subway station in Stockholm. This keyboard plays a note
when people step on it. As a result, people soon preferred going up and down the stairs
while making music rather than using the escalator. An objective test revealed that 66%
more people than normal chose the stairs over the escalator. Consequently, the element of
fun rather than words changed people behavior for the better.
For its part, “Fun Computing” is a coined term that means the use of media technology to
entertain people. Fun computing may motivate people to engage in more physical activity
or perform burdensome work in a fun manner.

2. Media interaction
Unlike physical simulations and mathematical computations, the design of an interactive
system is indirect, sensuous, and fuzzy because human behavior is involved.

2.1. Interaction
Computer-based media, also known as digital media, are characterized as interactive media.
People can freely access, edit, and share digital media content through computers.
According to the AIP cube model proposed by Zelter [1], interaction is an essential factor of
VR. Interaction is a process-related communication feature. In computer science,
“interaction” is interpreted as two-way communication in which a system reacts to the
user’s action and the user reacts to system response, as illustrated in Figure 1.
In computer science, interactivity can be quantitatively measured as follows:
1.
2.
3.

How quickly does the system respond to user input (speed)?
How accurate is the system output (accuracy)?
How many reaction variations does the system provide (richness)?

Figure 1. Interaction Model

The speed of a system depends on its computational power, sensing frequency, and
machinery response time and directly affects the user’s satisfaction with the system. The

Fun Computing 289

accuracy of system output primarily depends on the computational model and affects
system reliability. In the design of an interactive system, there is often a tradeoff between
speed and accuracy. Richness is the variety of system reactions and influences a user’s sense
of boredom. If a system only provides simple and predictable reactions, the user would
easily get bored with the system.

2.2. User experience
It is important to design an interactive entertainment system from the viewpoint of the
players by focusing on the quality of the user experience. That is, we design what the player
should experience, how the player might feel using a system, what kind of enjoyment and
surprise a system provides, among other features. In fun computing, we focus on designing
a system that is not technology oriented, although the idea of an entertainment application
using emerging technology such as VR and AR tends to emphasize technical fascination.
However, the user experience of a game is more important for a player. An application is
often designed by scripting a short story to illustrate a concept, and then, sketching the user
experience to embody the concept. Figure 2 shows the storyboard of the VR application
“Landscape Bartender,” which is described in Section 3.5.

Figure 2. Example of a storyboard

2.3. Media integration
The following should be considered while implementing an attractive entertainment
application using media technologies:

290 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

1.

Robustness

Robustness has two aspects. One is the ability of the software system to deal with errors and
handle unusual or atypical inputs. The other is durability with repetitive use. A user,
especially a child, often operates a system in a random and rough manner. Therefore,
robustness is the most important feature of an interactive system.
2.

Safety

Safety is an important issue for an interactive system if it has a mechanical force feedback
because it may harm the player. The visual feedback of the system should also be
considered. Visual interface artifacts may contribute to player sickness such as headaches,
asthenopia, and nausea. The image resolution, field of view, refresh rate, and time delay to
update a scene of the display are the main causes of sickness.
3.

Intuitiveness

In human–computer interaction, an intuitive interface is regarded as one that is easy to use.
People can intuitively use an application with little knowledge or directions on its usage.
That is, the users apply prior knowledge to the new system. Therefore, to design an intuitive
interface, it is essential to fill the gap between users’ current knowledge and target
knowledge needed to use the new system.
4.

Immersion

Immersion is the state of being mentally involved in a game; that is, the players do not feel
any physical borders around them. The sensation of immersion in a VR application can be
described as presence within the virtual space surrounding a player. The naturalness of the
virtual space, that is, the reality of the environment and prompt responses from the system,
are the key factors for promoting the sense of immersion.

3. VR applications
In this chapter, we consider VR applications that use an intuitive interaction model to
entertain people.

3.1. Ton2
3.1.1. Overview
Ton2 is a new body-sensory style VR application that is implemented using an intuitive and
robust interaction model, as shown in Figure 3 [2]. This application captures the player’s
motion data as displacement values by means of distance sensors and uses the data for its
interaction model.
We have revived an old Japanese traditional game, Paper-Sumo. This game is normally
played on a board using paper and cardboard; however, we have designed it as a

Fun Computing 291

game that can be played under water. We used water as the media and not just as an
element of enjoyment, but the players could experience the comfort of pressing down the
water surface. Moreover, when players respond to their opponents’ moves, the game
provides feedback similar to the original game. In the 3D imagery projected on a screen
floating on the water surface, both players push down the water surface in order to
control the movements of the sumo wrestlers. This gives a sense of a sumo wrestling
performance.

3.1.2. System configuration
This system consists of four modules, as depicted in Figure 3 (a): (1) A projector that projects
the image on the screen, which floats on water, as shown in Figure 3 (b). (2) Wave Generator
Cubes (WGCs) that produce waves from the pressing action of the players. There are three
WGCs on each side of the tank. (3) Distance sensors record displacement data. Four sensors
are placed at the corners of the screen and six (one for each WGC) are set under the tank. (4)
The computer controlling the entire system calculates the input data from an A/D
conversion board.
The process flow of the system is as follows:
(P1) The distance sensors obtain displacement data from the six WGCs and four corners of
the screen.
(P2) The computer calculates the velocity of the hold-down action of the WGCs and the
change in the slope of the floating screen on the basis of displacement data.
(P3) By using the results of P2, the computer determines the influence on the movement of
the Paper-Sumo wrestler.
(P4) The system calculates the interference and reaction of both wrestlers. At the same time,
it determines whether either of the wrestlers has won or lost.
(P5) The projector displays the 3D imagery generated for both wrestlers on the screen.

3.1.3. Result
The players experienced “Paper-Craft Sumo” underwater and enjoyed the game in a
typical manner. The 3D imagery projected when the Sumo wrestling is held underwater
provides visual enjoyment and the generated waves, which move back and forth in the
tank, also give the participant rhythmical comfort while having fun playing the wrestling
match. In Ton2, because the input is not a direct handling of the wrestler and instead the
wrestler is influenced by the waves, a participant must rely on his/her intuition and no
technique is required to play the game. Therefore, participants of any age can play Ton2
equally well. This was one of the fascinations of the traditional Paper-Sumo. Moreover,
the physical act of influencing the wrestlers and the visual sensation of the wave
movement stimulate the participants. As a result, there is both physical and visual
feedback to the players.

3.2. Kyukon
3.2.1. Overview
Traditional sports video games use buttons or sticks as user interfaces. These are unnatural
interfaces for playing sports. Kyukon creates a virtual pitching experience through a
nonwearable interface. Our system allows the control of a ball similar to a real pitcher. The
nonwearable interface employs wireless sensing technology and a strip screen. There are no
physical restrictions; hence, a user can freely pitch a ball.
The strip screen smoothly connects a player to the virtual stadium projected on the
screen. The objective is to strike out the batter. As the player throws the ball toward the
screen, the ball smoothly passes through the screen. At the same time, the virtual ball will be
projected at the exact position the player threw the ball, which also reflects the speed and
rotation of the thrown ball. The player can also pitch a miracle ball with a particular rotation
and speed.
A player can attempt controlling his/her arm and wrist to pitch a miracle ball. For example,
a faster ball will become a Flaming Miracle Ball that flies with the flame effect, as shown in

Fun Computing 293

Figure 4 (c), whereas a rapidly revolving ball will become a Tornado Miracle Ball with the
spiral effect.

3.2.2. System configuration
The strip screen is a novel display system that seamlessly connects the real and virtual
worlds, as shown in Figure 4 (a). It is composed of white vinyl and is divided into many
strips. A thrown ball will pass through the strip screen with a minimal distortion of the
screen. The screen immediately reforms and displays the virtual ball. We developed a
combination of a wireless accelerometer and optical sensors to create a nonwearable
interface system for pitching. The wireless accelerometer is placed inside the ball, as
depicted in Figure 4 (b2). It detects the time at which the ball is released from the hand and
the rotation of the ball. Optical sensors are installed behind the strip screen, as shown in
Figure 4 (b1). They detect the time when the ball reaches the screen and the position where it
passes through the screen.

3.2.3. Result
Kyukon, which is an intuitive interface for pitching a ball, enables various controls without
any physical restrictions owing to the nonwearable sensors. Moreover, we developed a
method for connecting the virtual and real worlds by enabling a continuation of objects
using the physical data of the player’s natural motion. This innovation enhanced the
experience of the sport.
In addition, we installed Virtual Petanque, as shown in Figure 4 (d2). The player can throw a
ball similar to a pitcher into a virtual field projected on the screen. The players could find a
new sense of fun while playing Virtual Petanque.

3.3. Interactive fountain
3.3.1. Overview
There are various computer-controlled fountains in the world. However, these
computerized fountains spray water in only some preset patterns. Dietz et al. demonstrated
three interactive water displays [3], but the water performance was not very dynamic, and
the displays were not too different from conventional fountains. In addition, Mann
developed a fluid-based tactile user interface with an array of fluid streams that work like
the keys on a keyboard [4].
This project suggests the possibility of a fountain with a novel display system that reacts to a
player’s motions. Our version of the interactive fountain is so compact that it can even be
installed in a living room. The system provides an ambient display with changing water jets
and color illumination. The goal of this project is to change the fountain into a design element,
such as the interior decoration of a room, and to demonstrate the possibilities of the fountain’s
interface by providing an exciting experience of fountains that react to a player’s actions.

294 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

Figure 4. Kyukon

3.3.2. System configuration
This system consists of a PC, a fan-type controller, a CCD camera, seven speakers, two
MIDI-controlled 4ch dimmer switches, and seven fountain units. Each metallic nozzle head
is surrounded by nine full-color LEDs, as shown in Figure 5 (b). The MIDI-controlled
dimmer switches supply electricity to the underwater pump. Electric current varies with the
MIDI signal and changes the height of the water jet. A self-illuminated fan is used as the

Fun Computing 295

body of the controller. A wireless three-axis accelerometer is mounted on the controller
handle. Figure 5 (c) shows the difference between the acceleration measurements of
“waving” and “cutting” motions. The system can distinguish between “waving” and
“cutting” motions by considering the changing ratio along the y- and z-axes. The system
changes the strength of the water jets and the illumination color on the basis of the
measured acceleration. Moreover, it detects the position of the controller by a background
image subtraction method. The detected position of light is used to select the fountain to be
activated.

Figure 5. Interactive Fountain

296 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

3.3.3. Result
In our system, the strength of the water jets as well as the illumination of water and sound
effects are dynamically changed according to player’s motions. Therefore, our interactive
fountain performs as a novel interactive water display.
The fountains instantly react to user motion, thus changing the water jet strength, illumination
colors, and sound effects. As shown in Figure 5 (d), a player can intentionally control
interactions using real water that cause the effect of water being scattered by the wind.

3.4. Witch’s cauldron
3.4.1. Overview
This project presents a novel interactive application that causes virtual objects to fracture by
stirring them with a wand. This application calculates the collision force for each object, and
an object breaks apart when it collides forcefully with others. The player interactively
crashes the objects with haptic sensation and simultaneously watches computer-generated
imagery of the fracture.

3.4.2. System configuration
Figure 6 (a) shows the system configuration. This system consists of (1) a screen that shows
the virtual world, (2) a rear-screen projector, (3) an interface to sense the movement of a
player and to display haptic sensations, (4) an electric circuit to control the stirring interface,
and 5) a PC to control the application.
Figure 6 (b) shows the stirring interface and Figure 6 (c) shows the data flow of the system.
When the player turns a wand, the universal joint turns the axis of a motor as shown in Figure
6 (c) (1). The system measures the rotation signal as shown in Figure 6 (c) (2) of the rotary
encoder, which is transferred from the motor control board. Finally, the system calculates the
status of the virtual wand using the measured rotation signal as shown in Figure 6 (c) (3).
The system provides haptic sensation via the wand as follows. The force information to be
applied to the stirring interface is transferred to the microcomputer as shown in Figure 6 (c)
(4). The microcomputer outputs a pulse wave modulation signal to the short brake circuit as
shown in Figure 6 (c) (5). The rotation speed is controlled with the short brake circuit as
shown in Figure 6 (c) (6), and the player experiences haptic sensation as shown in Figure 6
(c) (7).
Virtual objects are physically simulated in real time using a physical engine. When the
virtual objects are stirred with a wand, they receive an impulsive force from the wand. The
status of the wand is determined on the basis of the information transferred from the
microcomputer. The breakable object is composed of fragments that are connected to each
other with a joint force, as shown in Figure 6 (d). When a strong impulsive force is applied,
the joint is separated and the object is broken into fragments. A 3D CGI is generated in real
time and the image is projected on the screen.

3.4.3. Result
Today, the opportunity for physical exercise has decreased. As a result, the population is
becoming overweight. It is difficult for an overweight child or a person past middle age,
whose muscles are weak, to vigorously exercise without any training. There are many
training and fitness programs. However, people do not like to use conventional training
equipment such as dumbbells and jumping ropes because of their monotonousness. We
believe that they need exercise that uses their entire body and is fun.
The player of Witch’s Cauldron has to use his/her entire body to break the objects with the
wand. As a result, a fun activity is performed while exercising the entire body. Unlike
conventional VR applications, it can be effective in promoting physical health.
We believe that our technology can be applied not only to the destruction of virtual objects
but also to other kinds of operations. For example, we can equip a cooking trainer or a
simulator for heavy equipment with haptic sensation.

3.5. Landscape bartender
3.5.1. Overview
Some cocktails names compare cocktails to landscapes. For example, tequila sunrise
compares orange juice and grenadine to the morning sky with the glow of the sun. These
two elements generate a sunrise landscape. This project presents a system that generates
landscapes using a cocktail analogy [5]. With this system, users can generate landscapes in
the same manner that they make a cocktail, that is, by combining “ingredients.” Each
ingredient of the landscape cocktail, i.e., each landscape element, is actually water in a
different bottle. The player selects a bottle containing the intended landscape element and
pours a suitable amount of water into a shaker.
The system has eight elements: sand, rock, water, plants, sun, moon, stars, and clouds. The
elements of landscape are categorized into two groups—a) soil: sand, rock, water, and
plants; b) sky: sun, moon, stars, and clouds. The mixture ratio of these two element groups
determines the ratio of the ground and sky in the image. The amount of water used from
each bottle determines the ratio of the landscape elements. The ratio of sun and moon
changes over time with the altitude of sun/moon. If the ratio of the sun element is high, a
daytime scene is generated, as shown in Figure 8 (d1); otherwise, a nighttime scene is
generated, as shown in Figure 8 (d3). If the ratio of sun and moon is equal, an evening scene
is generated, as shown in Figure 8 (d2). Moreover, plants are grown only if water and
sand/rock are present.
The contour of the ground and the position of each element are changed by shaking the
shaker. The contour of the ground becomes rough if the controller is shaken vertically and
becomes smooth if it is shaken horizontally. Moreover, the sun shifts horizontally if the
controller is shaken horizontally. To give the player the feeling of generating his/her own
landscape, the system displays a vague in-progress image while he/she is shaking the
shaker. The in-progress image is unclear, and the contents of the shaker cannot be seen.

Fun Computing 299

After shaking the shaker, the player pours water into the cocktail glass. The resultant
landscape can be seen clearly only when the cocktail glass is placed on the coaster.

3.5.2. System configuration
The system consists of four modules, as shown in Figure 8 (a): (1) a shaker-type controller
with a three-axis wireless accelerometer hidden inside the cap of the shaker; (2) a measuring
module comprising eight digital scales for sensing the volume of water: a scale is used for
sensing the amount of each landscape element, and the data is used for the combining
process; (3) a counter-type image display unit; and 4) a PC. Acceleration data is used to
change the contour of the ground and the position of each element.
The sensing module for detecting the placement of the glass on the coaster is installed in the
counter-type image display unit. A magnetic chip is placed on the base of the glass.
Furthermore, a digital compass is used as the sensing module, which detects the approach
of the glass. The data from each module is transmitted to the PC via a serial connection and
a wireless signal.
The ground of a landscape is generated using a height map of resolution 256 × 256. Uniform
balls are set out on a grid at the initial condition, as illustrated in Figure 8 (c1). The size of
each ball is varied according to the strength of a shake in the vertical direction or averaged
according to the strength of a shake in the horizontal direction. The final surface model of
the ground is obtained from the deformed balls, as shown in Figure 8 (c2).

3.5.3. Result
This system provides the enjoyment of creating one’s favorite scenery. The technique of
designing a landscape follows the actual procedure of making a cocktail; therefore, a player
can easily understand the instructions.

Figure 7. Recipe Book

300 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

Figure 8. Landscape Bartender

The digital scale measures weight in units of cubic centimeters. Hence, the combination of
ingredients becomes almost infinite. The contour of the ground and the position of each
element are changed by shaking the shaker. Therefore, the system can generate a once-in-alifetime scene. In addition, we provided a “recipe” book, shown in Figure 7, as a reference to

Fun Computing 301

design scenery. However, most people enjoyed designing their own scenery like a chemistry
experiment.

3.6. Spider Hero
3.6.1. Overview
A superhero has overwhelming speed and power. The special ability of a superhero is his
most important characteristic. In this VR application, the user can jump from one building to
another by using a web, which is stuck to the user, similar to the famous superhero
SpidermanTM. In fact, the aim of this application is to provide the user the enjoyment of
using Spiderman’s superpower [6].
The user wears the web shooter illustrated in Figure 9 (b), which is a device used to shoot a
web. The user aims at a target building with this device. Then, when the user swings his/her
arm forward, the web is launched, thus sticking to the target building on the screen. Next,
the user’s arm is pulled in the direction of the target building by the pulling force feedback
system, which can provide the feeling of being pulled directly and smoothly as if attached to
an elastic string. Finally, the user moves toward the target building.

3.6.2. System configuration
This system consists of three components: a feedback system, input devices, and effects. The
feedback system includes an air module that gives the user the feeling of wind and a pulling
force feedback system that gives the user the feeling of being pulled. In this system, the
user’s arm is connected to an elastic line, and this line gives the user the sense of being
pulled. This line is attached to a rubber plug. This rubber plug is activated by a vacuum
device. However, without a limit on the system, the user will be indefinitely pulled by this
system. Hence, we introduce an openable cap using a servomotor. Using this openable cap,
we can control the strength of the pulling force. When the cap is closed, the pulling force is
the strongest. On the other hand, when the cap is open, the pulling force is zero. These
feedback systems provide the user with a force feedback of flying from one building to
another by means of the spider web.
As input devices, the user can use a pressure sensor and two web shooters. The sensor
allows the user to change his view by shifting his/her weight, and the web shooters are
interfaces to aim at a target building and launch the spider web.
To make this application as immersive as possible, we need to work on visual and sound
effects. This is particularly important to enhance the user experience of speed and
exhilaration. For visual effects, we use motion blur and focusing effects, as shown in Figure
9 (d1). Furthermore, we use sound effects of wind and a virtual city environment. The wind
sound effect uses a sound loop of wind and the pitch of this sound is modified depending
on motion speed. In the environment sound effect, we use nine sound sources in the virtual
city, as shown in Figure 9 (d2). When the user moves from the one place to another, he/she
notices a change in the environment’s sound because each sound source includes different
sounds.

302 Virtual Reality – Human Computer Interaction

Figure 9. Spider Hero

3.6.3. Result
This application has a dreamlike feel. The objective is to provide everyone with the
enjoyment of using super powers. In the application, the user can feel being pulled and can

Fun Computing 303

feel the wind through a force feedback system. Visual and sound effects immerse the user in
this VR experience. Moreover, the intuitive interface increases the operability of this VR
application. However, through experimental evaluation, we confirmed that the operability
is inadequate, and hence, we plan to improve the devices. On the software side, to provide a
better experience, we need to speed up the motion and wind. Our current pulling force
feedback system handles the pulling force only in one direction. We plan to overcome this
limitation by including a few pipes with openable caps and improving the content to
increase the sense of immersion.
This VR application requires the user to have a sense of balance in order to change the user’s
viewpoint and to swing both arms at a sufficient rate of speed. Therefore, this application
would be effective for whole-body exercise.

3.7. Extreme can crusher
3.7.1. Overview
Recently, environmental awareness has increased worldwide. One of the simplest actions
that can contribute to environmental conservation is crushing a can. It reduces the bulk of
cans, thus reducing recycling costs and environmental pollution. However, crushing cans is
a tedious and boring task. This project proposes a sustainable method for crushing cans by
applying the gamification approach.
The player places a can in the can crusher and his/her foot in the slipper. After engaging in a
walking-like motion wearing the slipper, a rocket is fueled up and launched. Here, the
amount of fuel is proportional to the speed of the player’s walking motion. The launching
direction is displayed cyclically within a half-round direction on the screen, and it is
determined by the timing of the foot motion. While the rocket is flying, it sows the soil with
seeds, and flowers bloom. The color of the flowers is related to the dominant color of the
crushed can.

3.7.2. System configuration
The system consists of three components: (1) a PC, (2) web camera, and (3) can crusher, as
shown in Figure 10 (a). Two vibrators are installed on either side of the slipper in which the
user places his/her foot. These vibrators imitate the rumbling of the ground when the rocket
is launched. An eccentric motor is used as a vibrator to display noticeable strong and longperiod vibrations. An infrared distance sensor is installed in the lower part of the can
crusher to detect the speed of the player’s foot motion. The height of rocket launch is
determined by the speed of the foot motion; the faster the motion, the higher the rocket flies.
A web camera is used to capture the surface of a can. After an image is captured, the system
extracts the image region that contains the can by using image background subtraction.
Then, it analyzes the dominant color of the can by an image histogram method. The
extracted dominant color is used as the color of flowers that will bloom.

Fun Computing 305

The system uses dual screens; the upper screen displays a scene of the flying rockets with
real-time graphics, as shown in Figure 10 (b), and the lower screen shows system
instructions, cheering characters, and a launching guide.

3.7.3. Result
It is observed that players enjoyed the ordinarily monotonous work of crushing a can
because the system makes it fun. The system displays the flight distance of the rocket and
the players tend to compete against one another. Some players gathered empty cans to use
with this system. We noticed that this application may contribute to the cleanliness of public
spaces and eco-conscious actions.

4. Conclusion
This chapter provided an overview of the basic concept of fun computing—a form of
entertainment that uses media technology. We reviewed the interaction between humans
and a VR environment and analyzed an interaction model. In addition, we outlined some
VR applications that entertain people by using an intuitive interaction model and showed
how “fun computing” helps motivate people’s actions and change human behavior. Fun
computing is widely applicable not only for entertainment but also for physical training,
rehabilitation, and moral consciousness improvement. Development of fun computing
applications is a comprehensive process and requires various skills— not only hardware
and software knowledge but also aesthetic design and storytelling abilities. Among them,
designing user experience is the most important and difficult skill needed to develop an
attractive application.
