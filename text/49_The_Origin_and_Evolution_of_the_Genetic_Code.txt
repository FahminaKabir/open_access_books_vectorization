Preface to “The Origin and Evolution of the Genetic
Code: 100th Anniversary Year of the Birth of
Francis Crick”

This Special Issue is dedicated to the origin and evolution of the genetic code and to the memory of
Francis Crick, the discoverer of the genetic code, in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of his birth
in 2016. The genetic code is one of the greatest discoveries of the 20th century as it is central to life itself. It
is the algorithm that connects 64 RNA triplets to 20 amino acids, thus functioning as the Rosetta Stone of
molecular biology.
Following the discovery of the structure of DNA by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953,
George Gamow organized the 20-member “RNA Tie Club” to discuss the transmission of information by
DNA. Crick, Sydney Brenner, Leslie Barnett, and Richard Watts-Tobin first demonstrated the three bases
of DNA code for one amino acid. The decoding of the genetic code was begun by Marshall Nirenberg and
Heinrich Matthaei and was completed by Har Gobind Khorana. Then, finally, Brenner, Barnett, Eugene
Katz, and Crick placed the last piece of the jigsaw puzzle of life by proving that UGA was a third stop
codon.
In the mid-1960s, Carl Woese proposed the “stereochemical hypothesis”, which speculated that the
genetic code derives from a type of codon–amino acid-pairing interaction. On the other hand, Crick
proposed the “frozen accident hypothesis” and conjectured that the genetic code evolved from the last
common universal ancestor and was frozen once established. However, he explicitly left room for
stereochemical interactions between amino acids and their coding nucleotides, stating that “It is therefore
essential to pursue the stereochemical theory … vague models of such interactions are of little use. What
is wanted is direct experimental proof that these interactions take place…and some idea of their
specificity.”
The origin and evolution of the genetic code remains a mystery despite numerous theories and
attempts to understand these. In this Special Issue, experts in the field present their thoughts and views on
this topic. “Double helix of DNA” and “genetic code table” are the greatest gifts that Francis Crick left
behind. He devoted himself to science until his death. His passion for science will continue to inspire
scientists now and forever.
“Nature isn’t conspiring against us to make important problems difficult, so given a finite life
span, aim high—go after fundamental problems.”—Francis Crick

Francis Crick (Figure 1) was born on 8 June 1916, in Northampton, England, and passed away
on 28 July 2004, in La Jolla, California, USA. This year, 2016, marks the 100th anniversary of his birth.
A drastic change in the life sciences was brought about by the discovery of the double helical structure
of DNA by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953 [1], eventually leading to the deciphering of
the genetic code [2]. The elucidation of the genetic code was one of the greatest discoveries of the
20th century. The genetic code is an algorithm that connects 64 RNA triplets to 20 amino acids, and
functions as the Rosetta stone of molecular biology.

At the age of 60, Crick moved to La Jolla from Cambridge, England, and shifted his focus to the
brain and human consciousness. He tackled this subject for the last 28 years of his life. His life-long
interest was the distinction between the living and the non-living, which motivated his research career.
Crick was arguably one of the 20th century’s most inﬂuential scientists, and he devoted himself to
science until his death.
Francis Crick continued to exercise his intellectual abilities throughout his life. His research
style was characterized by collaborations with outstanding partners, James Watson in discovering the

structure of DNA, Sydney Brenner in cracking the genetic code, Leslie Orgel in probing the origins of
life, and Christof Koch in understanding human consciousness. Francis Crick was never modest in his
choice of scientiﬁc problems [3] and was like “the conductor of the scientiﬁc orchestra” [4]. He always
discussed his ideas, which helped in the progress he made in science. Interestingly, his son, Michael,
then 12 years old, was the ﬁrst person to read the earliest written description of the genetic code.
Crick wrote the following in a letter to Michael,
“ . . . Now we believe that the D.N.A. is a code. That is, the order of the bases (the letters) makes
one gene different from another gene (just as one page of print is different from another). You can
now see how Nature makes copies of the genes. Because if the two chains unwind into two separate
chains, and if each chain then makes another chain come together on it, then because A always goes
with T, and G with C, we shall get two copies where . . . ” (Figure 2).

This is the fundamental principle of biology. The big questions that arose after the discovery
of the structure of DNA were “how is the code used?” and “what is it a code for?” Francis Crick
turned his attention to ﬁnd answers to these questions for the next 13 years. George Gamow, who is
famous for the Big Bang theory, founded the 20-member “RNA Tie Club” with Watson, to discuss the
transmission of information by DNA. RNA-illustrated neckties were provided to all members, and a
golden tiepin with the abbreviation for one of the 20 amino acids was given to each member. Crick
was “TYR” (tyrosine). Crick’s famous “adaptor hypothesis” was prepared for circulation in the RNA
Tie Club [5], but when Paul Zamecnik and collaborators discovered transfer RNA (tRNA) [6], Crick
did not believe that it was indeed the adaptor, because of its unexpectedly large size. Crick insisted
that there would be 20 different adaptors for the amino acids, and that they would bring the amino
acids to join the sequence of a nascent protein. A manuscript entitled “Ideas on protein synthesis
(October, 1956)” remains extant (Figure 3). Crick spoke about “The Central Dogma” at a Society for
Experimental Biology symposium on “The Biological Replication of Macromolecules”, held at the
University College London in September, 1957. The Central Dogma holds true even today, and is
another example of Crick’s genius.

In 1961, Francis Crick, Sydney Brenner, Leslie Barnett, and Richard Watts-Tobin ﬁrst demonstrated
the three bases of DNA code for one amino acid [7]. That was the moment that scientists cracked the
code of life. However, ironically, the ﬁrst decoding of the “word” of the genetic code was reported
in the same year by a non-member of the RNA Tie Club, Marshall Nirenberg, who spoke at the
International Biochemical Congress in Moscow. Matthew Meselson heard Nirenberg’s 15-minute talk
in a small room and told Crick about it. Crick arranged for Nirenberg to give the talk again at the
end of the meeting. Starting with Nirenberg and Heinrich Matthaei’s work [8], followed by that of
Nirenberg and Philip Leder [9], the decoding was completed by Har Gobind Khorana [10]. Finally,
Brenner, Barnett, Eugene Katz, and Crick placed the last piece of the jigsaw puzzle of life by proving
that UGA was a third stop codon [11].
Thus, the genetic code was cracked, and it is the greatest legacy left behind by Francis Crick,
along with the discovery of the double helical nature of DNA. As hallmarks of the foundation of
molecular biology, they will continue to shine forever. However, the origin and evolution of the
genetic code remain a mystery, despite numerous theories and attempts to understand them. In the
mid-1960s, Carl Woese proposed the “stereochemical hypothesis”, which suggested that the genetic
code is derived from a type of codon–amino acid pairing interaction [12]. On the other hand, Crick
proposed the “frozen accident hypothesis” and conjectured that the genetic code evolved from the
last universal common ancestor and was frozen once established. However, he explicitly left room
for stereochemical interactions between amino acids and their coding nucleotides, stating that “It is
therefore essential to pursue the stereochemical theory . . . vague models of such interactions are of
little use. What is wanted is direct experimental proof that these interactions take place . . . and some
idea of their speciﬁcity” [13].
What is the real origin of the genetic code? tRNAs and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases play
fundamental roles in translating the genetic code in the present biological system [14], but what could
have been the primitive forms of these molecules? Although Crick thought that tRNA seemed to be
nature’s attempt to make RNA do the job of a protein [2], the primordial genetic code prior to the
establishment of the universal genetic code might have resided in a primitive form of tRNA. Such an
example of “operational RNA code” [15] may be seen as a remnant in the acceptor stem of tRNA,
which still functions as a critical recognition site by an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase [16–18]. In addition,
why are 20 amino acids involved in the genetic code? Discrimination of an amino acid with the high
ﬁdelity attained by modern aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (error rate as low as 1/40,000 [19]) would be
impossible using a simple thermodynamic process alone, because the hydrophobic binding energy of a
methylene group is, at the most, ~1 kcal/mol. Therefore, several sets of amino acids with similar side
chains might have been coded non-selectively in the primitive stage [20]. Furthermore, the genetic code
is the relationship between left-handed amino acids and right-handed nucleic acids. As non-enzymatic
tRNA aminoacylation has been shown to occur chiral-selectively [21], the establishment of the genetic
code might be closely associated with the evolutionary transition from the putative “RNA world” to
the “RNA/protein world” in terms of homochirality [22]. All these are critical issues that should be
investigated in the future.
The life force of Francis Crick was once described as similar to the “incandescence of an intellectual
nuclear reactor” [23]. His passion for science is an inspiration for future scientiﬁc explorers. The Guest
Editor of this Special Issue dedicates all articles included herein to the memory of Francis Crick.

Abstract: The origin of biomolecular machinery likely centered around an ancient and central
molecule capable of interacting with emergent macromolecular complexity. tRNA is the oldest and
most central nucleic acid molecule of the cell. Its co-evolutionary interactions with aminoacyl-tRNA
synthetase protein enzymes deﬁne the speciﬁcities of the genetic code and those with the ribosome
their accurate biosynthetic interpretation. Phylogenetic approaches that focus on molecular structure
allow reconstruction of evolutionary timelines that describe the history of RNA and protein structural
domains. Here we review phylogenomic analyses that reconstruct the early history of the synthetase
enzymes and the ribosome, their interactions with RNA, and the inception of amino acid charging
and codon speciﬁcities in tRNA that are responsible for the genetic code. We also trace the age
of domains and tRNA onto ancient tRNA homologies that were recently identiﬁed in rRNA.
Our ﬁndings reveal a timeline of recruitment of tRNA building blocks for the formation of a functional
ribosome, which holds both the biocatalytic functions of protein biosynthesis and the ability to store
genetic memory in primordial RNA genomic templates.
Keywords: genome evolution; origin of proteins; ribosome evolution; origin of the genetic code

1. Introduction

Uncovering patterns and processes responsible for the origin of life in extant macromolecules is a
most challenging proposition. The biological world is largely governed by the functions of protein and
nucleic acid molecules. Proteins and RNA make up the molecular machinery of the cell while DNA
generally holds its historical repository, its “genetic” memory. The diversity of molecular structures
and functions that have been surveyed in proteins and nucleic acids is unprecedented. As of 26 October
2016, 1221 vetted 3-dimensional fold designs deﬁned by one protein classiﬁcation [1] encompass the
structure of 244,326 protein structural domains that hold individually or in combination ~5 million
experimental and non-experimental annotations of molecular functions deﬁned by ~9,000 terminal
Gene Ontology deﬁnitions [2]. Only a relatively small subset of these fold structures are present in
each and every organism that has been prospected [3]. Similarly, only 2,474 RNA families have been
deﬁned [4], of which only 5 are universal [5]. For decades, molecular biologists have pondered over
this diversity as they attempted to explain how life originated in this planet. The genomic revolution
has not been forthcoming either. No clear link has been found that explains how the 123,870 models of
molecular structure deposited in the entries of the PROTEIN DATA BANK (PDB) [6] and their associated
functions are encoded in the DNA of the 10,045 genomes and metagenomes that have been completely
sequenced (GOLD DATABASE [7]) and that have given rise to 0.55 million UNIPROTKB / SWISSPROT
and ~68 million UNIPROTKB / TREMBL protein sequence entries and information on thousands of

functional RNA molecules important for probing the workings of the cell. We know there is a code in
the memory of life, the genetic code. We do not know how that code maps to the memory of structure
and function of proteins, the structural and functional code. Here we argue that this crucial liaison
involves transfer RNA (tRNA) and was established very early in evolution once nucleotide cofactors of
primordial polypeptides were lengthened into primordial RNA loops. We propose that these nucleic
acid loops were capable of interacting stereochemically with evolving protein structure and responding
to their molecular makeup. Increases in these interactions canalized both the appearance of genetic
memory and building blocks (modules) of RNA with which to construct processive biosynthetic
machinery on one hand and genomic memory storage on the other. We review phylogenetic evidence
that provide support for these claims and address the properties of the emergent tRNA and rRNA
molecular systems viewed fundamentally from the perspective of emerging proteins and genetic
information in primordial cells. First, we examine the structures, functions and time of origin (age) of
structural domains of proteins deﬁned at the fold family (FF) and fold superfamily (FSF) levels of SCOP,
the Structural Classiﬁcation of Proteins [1]. In these studies, the ages of domains are derived from rooted
phylogenomic trees built from abundance counts of domains in proteomes [8–10]; Second, we use
a molecular clock of folds to convert relative age into geological time [10]; Third, the age of tRNA
and ribosomal substructures calculated from an exhaustive phylogenomic analysis of thousands of
molecules [3,11] is linked to the history of proteins; Finally, we assign ages of helical segments of rRNA
to remote tRNA homologies recently identiﬁed in rRNA [12], establishing correlations with the ages
of corresponding tRNA molecules [3]. The exercise reveals the modular role of tRNA in the early
evolution of ribosomes and genomes. The results and implications are remarkable.
2. Unity and Diversity in the Evolutionary History of Biological Modules and Systems

Ever since Darwin evolution has been described using the paradigm of trees (Figure 1a),
network abstractions that showcase complex historical processes of diversiﬁcation (Figure 1b,
bottom). The development of cladistics and advanced phylogenetic methodology has shown that
biological data exhibits one universal property: vertical traces of genetic memory across time are
always complemented with horizontal exchanges of that memory. Thus, the tree paradigm should
be considered an oversimpliﬁcation necessary for the heuristic computational search of optimal
phylogenies, hypotheses of history describing the evolution of the biological entities (taxa) that
are being studied. Instead, trees with reticulations (sometimes making up reticulated nets or
rhizomes; Figure 1b, top) may be more appropriate, especially when studying the evolution of taxa in
which processes of horizontal exchange of genetic information override vertical genetic signatures.
These scenarios are common in the evolution of bacteria and archaea. Central to evolutionary
tree and network thinking is the notion of a common ancestor to the group of evolving entities,
a “radix communis” that uniﬁes the phylogeny (Figure 1b). This usually takes the form of a “trunk”,
a branch leading to a root node exemplifying the hypothetical common ancestor of the entities that are
evolving along the branches of the tree or network.
Phylogenetic trees or networks are built from useful biological features of evolving taxa,
which are known as phylogenetic “characters”. These characters are usually building blocks (parts) of
more complex physical or functional systems (wholes). Molecular examples include amino acids of
proteins or nucleotides of nucleic acids. Because parts and wholes are interrelated, trees describing the
evolution of systems also describe the evolution of their building blocks (Figure 1c). Under this new
paradigm, the evolutionary uniﬁcation of building blocks results in new emerging systems (deﬁned
below), which then diversify. We exemplify this process with a mathematical abstraction (Figure 1d)
in which the edges of a primordial root network join to form an ancestor trunk edge. This trunk
then diversiﬁes into a crown network of extant entities and their ancestors. Here we focus on the
root network of this new abstraction, using structural domains of proteins and central nucleic acid
molecules as the subjects of study. We note that this new “hourglass” network paradigm applies to each
and every component part of a biological system and that each hourglass does not necessarily occur

contemporaneously in evolution. For example, the rise of multidomain proteins from the combination
of individual structural domains (reviewed in [3]) was likely preceded by the combination of lower
level structural parts to form each protein domain. Here we discuss how this can be made explicit to
help us understand processes of macromolecular emergence.

Figure 1. Paradigms governing evolution. (a) Tree of life drawn by German zoologist Ernst Haeckel
(ca. 1866) depicting the existence of a common ancestor or “radix communis organismorum” (the common
root of all organisms) unifying diversiﬁed cellular life embodied in the leaves of the tree or any transect
along its crown; (b) In mathematics (graph theory), a tree abstraction can be used to describe the
evolution of biological entities, which can be considered either parts of systems or entire wholes.
The tree must be rooted to impart a direction and “arrow of time” to its statement of diversiﬁcation and
change. However, tree descriptions can be faulty because multiple evolutionary origins (convergences)
are possible when the initial memory of systems is tangled by recruitment or other complicating
processes of horizontal exchange. These convergences cause reticulations (see tree with reticulation
in top) and in extreme cases “rhizomes” (inset). For example, taxon B has two possible ancestors
(one shared with taxon A and the other with taxon C and D), which converge to form its lineage;
(c) A new paradigm describes the rise of biological parts (modules) from more primordial components
and their subsequent diversiﬁcation. This is illustrated with a tree that shows its trunk separating its
root and crown. When considering all biological parts, the tree-like structure describes the evolution
of biological systems; (d) The abstraction of panel c can be deﬁned by two networks (root and crown
networks) joined by a common edge (trunk). This common edge represents the last common ancestor
of systems A, B, C and D (members of the crown) as it arises from modular parts a, b c and d (members
of the root).

3. Memory and the Evolutionary Drivers of Abundance, Recruitment and Accretion

An emerging system in biology must be dynamic and persistent. It must be a natural
object with behavior and makeup delimited by a set of interacting component parts (subsystems).
Its behavior and makeup must be characterized and individuated from other systems by its cohesion,
i.e., by the dynamical stabilities of the component parts when constrained by the system as a
whole [13,14]. Persistence refers to the ability of the system to display memory, i.e., to preserve
a behavior and make up despite constant perturbation from environments internal and external to
the system in question. Within these conﬁnes, the emerging system exploits the three fundamental
properties of any engineered object, economy, ﬂexibility and robustness [15]. Since these properties
are strongly impacted by the way the system perceives both the environment and its internal state,
the trade-off solutions that are achieved vary with time and context and have been modeled by a
“triangle of persistence” and the system’s environmental history, its “scope” [16]. We note that scope
has two components, “umwelt” (the system’s perception of that history) and “gap” (the system’s blind
spot, the scope that is not covered by its umwelt). The triangle of persistence was recently used to
mathematically explain the existence of a Menzerath-Altmann law of language in the domain makeup
of proteins [17]. This law, which states that larger systems hold smaller component parts, manifests by
decreasing the length of structural domains when their number increases in multidomain proteins.
Thus, the interplay of economy, ﬂexibility and robustness can be made explicit at the biomolecular and
biophysical level.
In biology, the memory of a hierarchical biological system (α) increases by increasing the
abundance of both its nested parts and wholes. Equation (1) summarizes the process of increasing
memory by increasing the number of parts and wholes (that we label a) to higher abundance levels
(a’ > a, that we label A).
α1

a→A

(1)

Highly abundant parts and wholes have higher chances of remaining persistent and by doing
so enhancing the survival and memory of the system under consideration. For that reason, it is
generally unlikely that once high abundance levels A are achieved these levels will return to lower
levels by loss, unless strong reductive evolutionary forces are at play that are beneﬁcial to the system.
This is particularly so when the views of hierarchical systems are global and focus on the higher
hierarchical level rather than the local and lower level. Abundance can be increased in many ways but
it generally involves the existence of compositional or informational bias. For example, the famous
Urey-Miller spark experiments of the 1950’s demonstrate the facile generation of only a limited set of
amino acids from the simulated gaseous environments of early Earth [18]. These sets include alanine,
glycine, aspartic and glutamic acid, valine, leucine, isoleucine and serine. These same amino acids are
overrepresented in salt-induced experimental formation of small dipeptides and polypeptides under
prebiotic conditions [19]. Similarly, peptides enriched in alanine, glycine, aspartic acid and valine hold
hydrolytic functions and can be produced experimentally by repeated dry-heating cycles and by solid
phase peptide synthesis [20]. Finally, these same amino acids are overrepresented in the dipeptide
constitution of proteins when globally surveyed in proteomes [21]. Thus, a memory implanted by
compositional biases in plausible chemical reactions manifests at different and increasing levels of the
hierarchy of life. In our example, they even express in proteins that are encoded by modern genomes.
It is particularly noteworthy that this memory has been made mathematically explicit by computer
simulations that describe how compositional biases relate to information storage [22].
Memory can also be enhanced by recruitment (also known as cooption or exaptation), the ability
to use existent parts in new different contextual environments. Equation (2) summarizes how the
process of memory of recruited parts a increases when these are recruited by parts b.

Since recruitment is usually associated with increases of abundance, the abundance of older parts
that are coopted by newer ones follow the trends of Equation (1). Examples of recruitment of these kinds
are many. In metabolism, a simple analysis of the distribution of protein fold structures in metabolic
pathways suggests metabolic networks grow piecemeal and form evolutionary patchworks [23].
More recently, the use of an algorithmic implementation that derives the most plausible ancestry of an
enzyme from structural and evolutionary annotations revealed that the recruitment of ancient domain
structures by modern enzymes is widespread in metabolic networks [24]. Note that parts need not be
physically associated to fulﬁll Equations (1) and (2) and enable increases of abundance by recruitment.
In the case of metabolic networks, the enzymatic parts that are recruited are often loosely associated in
the cell but their metabolic functions are established cohesively. Memory can also be enhanced by a
related process, accretion. This occurs when parts are recruited pervasively into a system, one at a
time, and remain tightly linked with each other. We note that in most cases the recruited parts become
physically associated with the growing system, with b of Equation (2) representing the growing system
and a the accreted part. Examples of accretion of these kinds are macromolecular complexes such as
the ATP synthases and the ribosome [25,26]. The F-type and A/V-type synthases are multi-subunit
complexes responsible for membrane-coupled energy conversion reactions. They produce most of
the ATP needed to power cellular processes. Using phylogenomic methods we have shown that
the synthase complexes developed gradually by addition of structural domains, starting with the
ring structures of the rotating head, followed by the central stalk (the axle), and ending with the
structures that regulate their motion (the stators) [25]. Similarly, the ribosome has been shown to
grow in evolution by addition of helical segments to the evolving molecules [26], complying with the
principle of continuity that sustains evolutionary thinking and explaining the formation of highly
sophisticated macromolecular machinery.
Since parts and wholes in biology are highly dynamic entities, only the subset of them that
expresses some long-term stability and arise as cohesive element within the expanding hierarchical
system will be stable enough to display memory. These parts generally represent modules. A module
can be deﬁned as a set of integrated parts that cooperate to perform a task [27]. These parts interact
more with each other than with other parts of the system, including parts of other modules. Since
modules result from the emergent properties of the hierarchical system [15], they must hold history.
While deﬁning modules in biology can be challenging, the fact that modules must be “evolutionary
units” enables the use of phylogenetic methods to appropriately test deﬁnitions of modularity. In this
regard and in the absence of clear statements of topographic correspondence, deﬁnition of modules
through homologies often requires dynamic homology analysis [28] or the use of hidden Markov
models [29]. These methods are capable of distinguishing similarity due to common ancestry from
similarities due to other causes that are not evolutionary.
4. The Usefulness of Abundance in Phylogenomic Analysis

We study the crucial role of abundance by focusing on the evolution of proteins and nucleic acids
and reconstructing phylogenetic hypotheses that are grounded in data and computational optimization.
Both of these macromolecules are responsible for the rise of biology and genetic memory that we here
explore. Methodologically, we take an ideographic (historical and retrodictive) approach that uses
information in the protein repertoires of thousands of genomes and advanced tools of phylogenetic
analysis to build statements of history, phylogenies of protein parts [3]. The approach takes advantage
of the beneﬁts that both molecular structure and abundance provide to the many challenges of
phylogenetic reconstruction. These beneﬁts have been discussed in detail elsewhere [30]. Because
protein domain structure is several orders of magnitude more resistant to the effects of mutation than
its sequence [31], its high conservation levels make structure more suitable for deep phylogenetic
exploration. In particular, the slow evolutionary pace of structural change diminishes the chances that
the consequences of the “Markov chain convergence theorem” and the “data processing inequality”,
which deﬁne how time erases useful historical information, limit retrieval of evolutionary history [32].

Furthermore, the use of domain abundance as phylogenetic character avoids the need of alignments
in phylogenetic analysis of sequences (the search for similarities of sets of sequences with unknown
correspondences but restricted by the lineal order of residues in the sequence). It also offsets the
limitations of character independence of phylogenetic reconstruction that plague the use of molecular
sequences in phylogenetic analysis; the mere existence of folding and 3-dimensional structure in
macromolecules implies character non-independence in a sequence alignment.
The methodology not only builds phylogenetic trees or networks that describe the origin
and evolution of protein and nucleic acid repertoires but also tests if the molecular data that
is being analyzed holds historical information. This second aspect of the analysis is crucial
since it provides experimental support to the link between molecular abundance and history that
enables the construction of powerful trees describing the evolutionary history of molecular parts
(e.g., the entire world of protein domains or substructures that describe the history of RNA molecules).
It also dispels the possibility that molecular structures emerged from lower component parts
(e.g., loops, or nucleic acid motifs) by their fortuitous association, driven solely by improvements
in functional versatility. Finding phylogenetic signal in the data supports the existence of historical
contingency. We note the importance of understanding the meaning of trees of component parts.
For example, a “tree of structural domains” holds domains (suitably deﬁned) as taxa (the leaves of
the tree) and deﬁnes historical relationships (tree topologies) based on domain abundance in the
proteomes analyzed (the phylogenetic characters and data analyzed). Since the data matrix makes
use of molecular abundance, the tree that is built from the data does not arise from a model of change
that involves structural transformations of domains (e.g., [33]). Instead, the historical relationship of
different domains is inferred directly from quantitative information in genomic makeup. This “criterion
of primary homology” rests exclusively on genomic abundance of individual domains in proteomes,
and its validity is permanently tested by mutual optimization of phylogenetic signal in characters and
tree reconstruction (an exercise known as Hennigian illumination). Thus, the methodology operates
under the Popperian pillars of content of theories and degree of corroboration (see [21] for an explicit
elaboration), acknowledging the need of more modern technical deﬁnitions of “verisimilitude” for
scientiﬁc inquiry. The historical signal and reliability of phylogenies of structural domains that have
been published are being gradually strengthened by more data (e.g., more proteomes and better
sampling of the world of cells and viruses) and better optimization (e.g., improved hidden Markov
models and increased background knowledge).
Operationally, the phylogenomic methodology of building trees of parts starts by deﬁning
taxa and doing so exhaustively (e.g., all suitably deﬁned structural domains present in proteomes,
all substructures of RNA molecules). Properties of this ﬁnite taxon set are then studied, such as
abundance of structural domains in proteomes or structural or thermodynamic features of RNA
substructures in RNA molecules. This generates taxon-character data matrices with data encoded by
transformation into alpha-numeric values suitable for optimization with phylogenetic reconstruction
software. The software optimizes character changes in all possible unrooted trees (portraying
phylogenetic relationships of taxa) during exhaustive or branch-and-bound tree searches or uses
heuristic approaches to ﬁnd optimal solutions according to the maximum parsimony criterion.
The most parsimonious trees that are retained are then rooted a posteriori using Weston’s generality
criterion of derived character states being less widespread in tree branches implemented with the
Lundberg method, which reorients and roots the tree by pulling down the branch that yields the
minimum increase in character state change. The rooted trees that are recovered are comb-like and can
be converted into chronologies of taxa by backward-counting nodes (branch points or bifurcations)
from leaves to the root of the optimal trees. This counting deﬁnes a relative node distance (nd) and a
scale from nd = 0 (most basal and old) to nd = 1 (most recent and young), which is used to deﬁne how
evolutionarily derived is each taxon in the tree of parts. In the case of protein structural domains,
we have shown that nd correlates strongly with actual time for folds that are linked to markers of the
geological record [10]. We use this molecular clock of folds to deﬁne the ages of structural domains

11

MDPI Books

Life 2016, 6, 43

as a chronology in billions of years (Gy). Given protein-RNA domain interactions that are known,
the chronology can be used to transfer age from proteins to interacting RNA by assuming that the age
of the RNA molecule is the age of the protein-RNA interaction.
We end by noting that abundance can be coarse-grained into occurrence for phylogenomic
analysis, i.e., quantitative valued characters can be reduced to a data matrix of 0 s and 1s, a binary
system. While coarse-graining results in some loss of phylogenetic signal, occurrence and abundance
generally produce congruent historical statements that can be separately optimized (e.g., [34]).
5. The Early Primacy of Peptides, Polypeptides and Proteins in Cellular Environments

“All language is a set of symbols whose use among its speakers assumes a shared past. How,
then, can I translate into words the limitless Aleph, which my ﬂoundering memory can scarcely
encompass?” —El Aleph and Other Stories, Jorge Luis Borges.

In modern biology, peptides and proteins are encoded in genomes and are translated from
mRNA into folded polymers that are functional. Similarly, transcribed non-coding RNA folds into
functional forms. The 3-dimensional molecular structures of these macromolecules tend to become
compact when they collapse into stable conformations and abandon the beneﬁts of interacting with the
aqueous environment that forces them to maintain the unfolded state. The folded structures provide a
fundamental scaffold to constrain in favorable conformation the small subset of amino acid residues
responsible for protein functions. These residues are generally lodged in pockets on the surface of the
protein, though networks of residues throughout the molecule play also roles in allosteric regulation
and protein stability. The small subset of residues is mostly associated with the unstructured regions
of proteins, suggesting that the complex arrangement of secondary structures (helix, strand and turn)
collapses into 3-dimensional topologies that best respond to the needs of the more dynamic and
functional regions of the protein. In fact, phylogenomic analysis has shown that folding speed and
ﬂexibility are beneﬁcial traits that are fostered in evolution [35] and that ﬂexible loop regions were
enriched in proteins by the rise of genetics [21]. Moreover, structural ﬂexibility is even a conserved
feature in the assembly of protein complexes [36]. Thus, protein ﬂexibility appears a crucial property
in protein evolution at different levels of the hierarchical molecular system, even in the absence of a
primordial biology that could translate nucleic acid information into proteins.
Structural domains in proteins are considered evolutionary units. Any statement about
their history that is obtained using phylogenetic approaches or hidden Markov model libraries
(e.g., timelines of the evolutionary appearance of domains, trees or networks of domains, domain
groupings) will relate solely to their history and not to the history of other modules and evolutionary
units that exist at lower or higher level of the hierarchical molecular system. During the past decade we
have generated phylogenomic reconstructions of the evolution of structural domains at the different
structural abstractions of SCOP: folds, FSFs and FFs, from deeper to shallower evolutionary views
of molecular structure (reviewed in [3]). The emergent picture of molecular evolution derived from
domain history is largely congruent regardless of the level of abstraction [9] or the classiﬁcation system
that is used to deﬁne structural domains [37]. The very early and oldest domains are fully dependent
on cellular membranes. Thus, the ﬁrst proteins appear to have emerged enclosed in primordial
containers (cells) and evolved from there to form the wide diversity of globular proteins that currently
exist. A devil’s advocate however could challenge any inference derived from annotations of historical
timelines by claiming bioinformatic associations of functions and structures say nothing about early
historical processes. Indeed, one must assume that modern deﬁnitions of functions and structures can
be used to interpret those that existed in the past. In other words, we must consider that viewing past
events with a modern “lens” is a valid approach. This may not always hold [32] and more philosophical,
mathematical and biological elaborations of the implications of considering modern entities as relics of
the past await development. The early rise of cellular containers as single or multi-layer vesicles is
however supported by the existence of amphiphilic molecules in meteorites that organize themselves
spontaneously into liposomes in the laboratory and the possible important role of meteoritic inﬂux on
12

MDPI Books

Life 2016, 6, 43

the environments of early Earth (see discussions in [9,25]). Similarly, plausible prebiotic synthesis of
membrane constituents exist that could explain their early and abundant formation, notably aided
by the effects of clays and other mineral deposits. Finally, structural canalization can be invoked as
important force that freezes in time the structure of molecules making these structures highly conserved
at evolutionary level [38]. While the activity of this force throughout all levels of structural complexity
remains to be explored, canalization appears an important and general principle of conservation in
biology that shields the effects of the environment on the organism and may represent an inevitable
consequence of complex processes [39].
A previous study mapped in detail the ﬁrst evolutionary appearance of the oldest 54 FFs and
traced a number of properties of these protein structures, including their ability to bind cofactors,
interact with RNA, and display broad molecular movements and ﬂexibility [9]. The set was selected
because it laid the foundations for both the metabolic and translation machineries [8,9]. The very
early timeline of FFs, which is described in Figure 2, showed that the ﬁrst four FFs were the ABC
transporter ATPase domain-like family (c.37.1.12), the extended and tandem AAA-ATPase domain
families (c.37.1.20 and c.37.1.19) and the tyrosine-dependent oxidoreductase domain family (c.2.1.2),
all of which exist in highly structured cellular environments. The functions of these FFs are linked to
the start of modern metabolic networks, providing hydrolase and transferase functions needed for
nucleotide interconversion, storage and phosphate transfer-mediated recycling of chemical energy,
and terminal production of beneﬁcial cofactors (e.g., [40]). The early evolution of metabolism in
association with nucleotide cofactors culminated with the appearance of the ﬁrst enzymes of the
biosynthetic pathways of nucleotide metabolism 3.5 Gy-ago and the completion of a functional
biosynthetic pathway ~3 Gy-ago, which coincides with the rise of a functional ribosome [41].
These coordinated developments suggest the coevolutionary need of a steady supply of nucleotide
precursors internal to the cell for the synthesis of large RNA molecules, large enough to store genomic
information and fulﬁll the ribosomal role of processive biosynthesis. The rise of aerobic metabolism
at about that time (~2.9 Gy-ago) ultimately results in the great oxygenation event (GOE) of our
planet that occurred 2.45 Gy-ago [42], which coincides with the rise of superkingdom-speciﬁc domain
structures and early organismal diversiﬁcation that we call the epoch of “superkingdom speciﬁcation”
(Epoch 2; Figure 2).
The P-loop containing nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) hydrolase fold (c.37) is the ﬁrst folded
structure of the timeline of FFs (Figure 2). It appears for the ﬁrst time associated with a primordial
bundle, the predominant structure of proteins associated with membranes. The c.37 structure
holds a “Rossmann-like” α/β/α-layered design that “sandwich” a sheet of strands between helical
segments. This layered design dominates the topologies of many subsequent basal FF structures,
including 36 of the 54 oldest FFs. The primordial appearance of this fold conﬁrms once again
abundant evidence from phylogenetic reconstruction suggesting that the layered structure was
responsible for the ﬁrst compact protein modules (beginning with [43]). The primordial α/β/α-layered
structure has special properties related to lower level structural organization that are very relevant.
The structural and functional diversity of proteins can be described by a combinatorial interplay
of “supersecondary” structures, modular-like arrangement of helix, strand and turn segments
(e.g., αα-hairpins, ββ-hairpins, βαβ-elements), that act as lower level evolutionary building blocks
of protein folds and biochemical diversity [44,45]. These supersecondary motifs are generally
~25–30 amino acid residues long and in most cases form recurrent loop structures, many of which
determine biochemical diversity [46] and protein ﬂexibility [21]. In evolution, these so called
“elementary functional loops” (EFLs) likely combine with each other to better bind cofactors and
exert molecular functions (Figure 3a). In fact, the history of these EFLs can be traced back to a small
set of loop prototypes, which represent collectives of many sequences embedded in proteins and
capable of collapsing into stable loop structures. These EFLs are likely stabilized by the formation of
van der Waals locks [47]. An analysis of the most abundant of these EFL prototypes revealed they
were associated with a small set of folds deﬁned at the FSF level of the SCOP hierarchy [48].

Figure 2. Timeline describing the evolution of structural domains responsible for the primordial
components of metabolism and translation. The timeline was derived directly from the tree of FFs
reconstructed from free-living organisms. Ages are given as node distances (ndFF ) and geological
time in billions of years (Gy). Time ﬂows from top to bottom. The three evolutionary epochs of
the protein world, “architectural diversiﬁcation” (epoch 1), “superkingdom speciﬁcation” (epoch 2),
and “organismal diversiﬁcation” (epoch 3) (see deﬁnition in [8,9]) are indicated with different color
shades. Fundamental structural and functional discoveries are identiﬁed with circles along the timeline.
The inset describes in detail the evolutionary timeline of the 54 most ancient FFs, showing examples
of 3-dimensional models and idealized structures with diagrams representing helices with red dots
and sheets of strands with blue lines. Colored arrowheads indicate FFs associated with the listed
functional discoveries. aaRS, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase; NRPS, non-ribosomal peptide synthetase;
PTC, peptidyl transferase center; ;PCP, peptidyl carrier protein.

Figure 3b shows a small subnetwork of the most abundant EFL prototypes and their FSFs,
with the ages of FSF mapped onto the network and transferred to EFLs [49]. The bipartite network
showed that the P-loop hydrolase FSF (c.37.1) was the most connected hub, beneﬁting from the
assembly of numerous EFLs. In particular, the EFL 536 hub links c.37.1 to the NAD(P)-binding
Rossmann fold FSF (c.2.1) that holds the ancient tyrosine-dependent oxidoreductase domain FF.
Remarkably, the small subnetwork contains the oldest FSFs of the EFL-FSF network, supporting the
fundamental evolutionary link of abundance and time of origin of modules and the special properties
of the α/β/α-layered design for building domains. The fact that the history of domains matches
inferences from the bipartite network suggests domains structures assembled from loops to form
larger and more stable folded structures and that loop ligations were more prone to form stable
folded structures (given biases of prebiotic amino acid constituents) in areas of sequence space that
materialized into the c.37 fold.

elementary polypeptide loops (colored red and yellow) with αα-hairpin structures have sites capable
of binding to a protoporphyrin IX-iron complex (heme) for oxygen transport when they come together

by addition of extra α-helices produces the modern structural domain of the α-chain haemoglobin;

that describes how FSF share EFLs in proteins [48]. This subnetwork is also the oldest. The age of FSFs
(nd) is indicated inside circles. The P-loop hydrolase fold (c.37.1, nd = 0) is the most connected FSF and
EFL 536 and EFL 1845 the most connected loops in the subgraph and in the entire network that is not
shown. Prototype logos in the right show amino acid residue frequencies in sequence sites of the most
ancient EFLs and a clear pattern of EFL length decrease with age that extends to the rest of the graph.
Edges represent EFL matches to domains; their width is proportional to the number of matches. FSFs
are labeled with SCOP concise classiﬁcation strings and EFLs with prototype numbers.

This primordial α/β/α-layered design of the most ancient FFs has also special properties related
to amino acid usage. The c.2.1.2 structure for example uses almost exclusively amino acids encoded by
the GC-rich half of the codon table and its genes have multiple open reading frames [50]. This appears
to indicate that these enzymes acquired their fold structures earlier than a diversiﬁed genetic code.
Similarly, the dipeptide make-up of protein domains appearing early in the timeline is enriched in
hydrophobic amino acids and underrepresented in dipeptides participating in ﬂexible loop regions,
suggesting protein ﬂexibility was an important driver for the rise of genetics [9,21]. Enrichment
patterns suggest hydrophobicity of dipeptide make-up of the ﬁrst FFs and a primordial association
with membranes. Their rigid protein structures lacking ﬂexible arms and showing limited motions is
compatible with standard enzymatic functions. We note however that mutation saturation of sequences
has probably replaced the amino acid repertoires present in ancient domain structures with amino
acids of the modern 20+ repertoire and that FF structural cores have been decorated with additional

15

MDPI Books

Life 2016, 6, 43

structures of much more recent origin, probably harboring all possible amino acid sites. Thus, more
modern processes of change complicate inferences derived from sequence analysis.
6. The Late Appearance of Interactions with RNA

A number of FFs appeared ~3.7–3.6 Gy-ago (ndFF = 0.02–0.045) after the rise of metabolism
(Figure 2). These structures catalyzed crucial acylation and condensation reactions involved in
aminoacylation of tRNA bound to aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) or phosphopantetheinyl
arms of carrier proteins that are part of non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) complexes.
These structures, which made their debut before ribosomal proteins in the timeline of FFs, are also
part of the catalytic makeup of enzymes important for fatty acid biosynthesis. The ﬁrst four FFs
of this group involve class I aaRS catalytic domain (c.26.1.1), class II aaRS and biotin synthetases
(d.104.1.1), G proteins (c.37.1.8) and actin-like ATPase domain (c.55.1.1) FFs. All of them have the
α/β/α-layered Rossmannoid design and three of them deﬁne the catalytic domains of aaRSs and
structures of elongation factors that are central for translation and the speciﬁcity of the genetic code.
Translation therefore appears to have metabolic origins that predate the appearance of the ribosome [8].
We note the profound implications of the phylogenomic timeline, especially for proponents of the
ancient “RNA world” theory that dominates current thinking in origin of life research. While we have
discussed the feasibility of this theory elsewhere [25], we ask the reader to keep an open mind when
considering the alternatives suggested by phylogenetic evidence that will follow.
Before discussing further implications of the timeline, we want to emphasize the putative
environment that fostered all of these structural innovations. Without a genetic memory,
the systems had to rely exclusively on biases of the emerging polymers, the prebiotic and biotic
chemistries surrounding their functions, and the physical constraints imposed by the emerging cellular
systems. The sequence and structures of proteins that we study today have been the subject of up
to ~3.8 Gy of continued optimization, of course within the constraints of structural canalization.
During the ﬁrst few hundred million years, those same macromolecules could have not achieved the
levels of compactness of modern folds nor the functional efﬁciency and speciﬁcity of the modern
macromolecules for several reasons. Evolutionary optimization through mutational change (read
compositional variation) could have not covered enough sequence space and any diffusion by
random walk had to be faulty and limited by frequent loss and absence of strong selective constraint.
We therefore envision that molecules spent considerable time in conformations that were unproductive
but were still able to advance optimization through the compositional codes that were slowly
materializing. This probably involved favoring limited sets of building blocks, smaller molecules, and
smaller patches of inter-molecular interactions. It is highly likely that a multitude of reactants and
chemical reactions was available for probing in billions of combinations throughout the entire planet
and that only those fortuitous successes would have spread to the rest of the cellular systems through
rather free cellular exchange. This necessitates “porous” membranes and smaller molecules than those
of today’s biology. For example, it would be non-productive to combine emerging domains into larger
ensembles during that time. Indeed, phylogenetic analysis suggests that it took and additional ~2 Gy
to fully develop the beneﬁts of domain combinations in multidomain proteins [51].
Implicit in the evolutionary appearance of tRNA-associated FFs is the development of
stereochemical interactions between molecules that could jumpstart both “translation speciﬁcity”
and “genetic memory”. We have proposed a model of emergence of genetics in which molecular
interactions deﬁne: (i) speciﬁcities of an emerging genetic code in “identity elements” of the nucleic acid
molecule; and (ii) corresponding FF enzymatic activities responsible for tRNA aminoacylation and the
formation of peptide bonds [21]. A corollary that follows from this model is that stereochemical
interactions were established between small polypeptide and nucleic acid molecules that were
already “structured” by molecular folding. This implies that the FF structural cores had already
assembled from small EFLs by statistically biased condensation reactions and were developing
archaic aminoacylation and ligation activities for cellular persistence. We stress that the dual role of

16

stereochemical interactions is needed to explain the hidden evolutionary link between the speciﬁcity
of tRNA identity elements and information in the structure of proteins, and at the same time, explain
the selective forces that could be at play. We posit that the hidden link is the formation of dipeptide
molecules from pairs of aminoacylated tRNAs by primordial aaRS urzymes [21]. Figure 4 shows that
class II aaRS and biotin synthetases (d.104.1.1) and class I aaRS catalytic (c.26.1.1) domains responsible
for SerRS and TyrRS aminoacylation activities, respectively, have close structural homologues in amino
acid-[acyl carrier protein]-ligases (aaACPLs) and cyclodipeptide synthases (CDPSs), respectively.
Note that aaACPLs are relatives of NRPSs and CDPSs are dipeptidases that produce dipeptides
from sets of two aminoacylated tRNA. These strong structural homologies are evolutionarily deep.
They reveal highly conserved structural protein cores that are putative founders of archaic biosynthetic
activities needed to jumpstart primordial genetic and structural codes. To test if indeed dipeptidases
were involved in providing building blocks for the structuring of protein domains, we looked for
biases in the dipeptide make-up of FFs appearing prior to anticodon binding domains, and found
signiﬁcant biases (p < 0.05) against ﬂexible loop regions but favoring turns and bends in the initial
FFs [21]. This suggests that genetics arose from biases in the 400+ word vocabulary of dipeptides that
makes up proteins and a transition from rigid to ﬂexible protein structural cores.

shows structural alignment conservation used in the tracing of polypeptide backbones. The proximity
in DALI structural neighborhoods of aaACPLs and CDPSs to aaRS catalytic cores with major groove
speciﬁcities suggests a deep evolutionary link to archaic founders of aaRS biosynthetic activities [21].

7. Deﬁning a Natural History of Protein Catalytic Mechanisms and Their Interaction
with Cofactors

Biocatalytic mechanisms are chemical transformations of organic compounds facilitated by
protein enzymes and other natural catalysts. In turn, cofactors are “helper” non-protein chemical
compounds required for biomolecular activity. Mechanisms and cofactors must reside in special
pockets of the enzymatic structure (e.g., active sites) for them to be effective. Recent studies traced the
appearance of biocatalytic mechanisms and associated cofactors in structural domain evolution [9,52].
Phylogenomic trees reconstructed from a structural census at the “homology superfamily” level of
the CATH classiﬁcation system (analogous to the FF level of SCOP) allowed to trace the mechanistic
step types of the fold structures [52]. Each mechanistic step type is one of 51 mechanistic annotations
in the MACiE database that are used to describe the chemistries underlying enzymatic activities.
17

The basal P-loop containing NTP hydrolase fold (3.40.50.300) introduced the mechanistic steps that are
most widely spread in enzymes, including “proton transfer”, “bimolecular nucleophylic addition”,
“bimolecular nucleophylic substitution” and “unimolecular elimination by the molecular base”.
However, it was two of the following three CATH structures that added almost half of all 51 mechanistic
annotations, the NAD(P)-binding Rossmann-like domain (3.40.50.720) and FAD/NAD(P)-binding
domain (3.50.50.60) (Figure 5a). These structures preceded the inception of domains that interact with
RNA, the Hups (3.40.50.620) α/β-layered domains of aaRSs, which introduce the single mechanistic
step of “intramolecular elimination” needed to fulﬁll their aminoacylation reactions.
A similar progression can be seen by studying the use of cofactors by SCOP FFs in the timelines [9]
(see Figure 2). The ﬁrst appearance of domain interactions with cofactors inferred by cofactor
annotations in entries of the PROCOGNATE and PDB databases revealed the primordial use of ATP and
ADP by the c.37.1 structure (Figure 5b), an observation previously intimated from the distribution
patterns of small molecule ligands in proteins [53]. However, the Rossmann fold of the c.2.1.2 FF that
followed added almost half of all known cofactors of proteins. This burst matches the substantial
rise of mechanistic steps immediately preceding the appearance of catalytic domains of aaRSs and
protein interactions with tRNA. The ﬁnding supports the long held idea of RNA originating from
ligation of precursors that were acting as cofactors (e.g., [54]). However, and in contrast with many
RNA world-inspired proposals, these ribotide cofactors were being synthesized in pockets of the
primordial α/β/α-layered structures. This is compatible with the observation that aaRSs are able
to form a wide variety of dinucleoside oligophosphates in the presence of amino acids (e.g., [55]),
a property that is also shared by NRPS domains. We therefore hypothesize that the α/β/α-layered
structures fostered nucleotide ligations that extended suitable combinations of nucleotides to form
longer polymers and that this interplay naturally materialized in rudiments of the genetic code within
the conﬁnes of an increasingly more complex ribonucleoprotein molecular world. Conversely and in
parallel, the α/β/α-layered structures could have also facilitated the ligation of dipeptide and small
peptides to form larger molecules. As mentioned above, the structures of catalytic domains of aaRSs
can form dipeptides with the aid of tRNA molecules (e.g., [56]), a molecular function that left relics in
the dipeptide makeup of proteins [21].

Figure 5. The very early accumulation of new mechanistic steps (a); and cofactors (b) in evolutionary
timelines of structural domains. Mechanistic step types were taken from annotations in MACiE [52].
Relationships that exist between cofactors and FFs were derived from the PROCOGNATE and the
PDB databases [9]. The total cofactor dataset contains both experimentally veriﬁed cofactor-structure
relationships and relationships that are not. The most ancient CATH homologous superfamilies and
SCOP FFs were arranged by their age (nd values). White shaded areas involve domain structures that
do not interact with RNA.

8. The Coevolutionary History of Emerging tRNA, rRNA and Proteins and the Rise of Genetics

If indeed emerging domains interacted with initial tRNA cofactors, then it is possible to envision
that aaRS enzymes coevolved with tRNA during the rise of genetic code speciﬁcities and that tRNA
coevolved with the emerging ribonucleoprotein structure of the ribosomes. Coevolution is here
deﬁned as the coordinated succession of structural changes mutually induced by the increasingly
interacting and growing protein and nucleic acid molecules in their quest to fold into more stable
and functionally efﬁcient structures that would provide enhanced stability to primordial cells. Using
phylogenomic reconstruction we have been able to support both of these coevolutionary assertions
with considerable data. Phylogenetic analysis of thousands of RNA molecules and millions of protein
structural domains allowed reconstruction of phylogenies and evolutionary timelines of the history
of tRNA amino acid charging and anticodon-binding speciﬁcities of tRNA [20] and the history of
ribosomal accretion [11]. The relative ages of structures of aaRS domains, ribosomal proteins, tRNA
and rRNA drawn directly from the phylogenetic trees were indexed with structural, functional and
molecular contact information and mapped (by color) onto three-dimensional models of individual
molecules and ribosomal complexes (Figure 6). Four important coevolutionary patterns were revealed.

Figure 6. Coevolution of proteins and nucleic acids to form the evolutionary cores of translation
machinery and genetics. (a) The age of the domains of aaRSs, exempliﬁed by IleRS (PDB entry 1qu2),
match the age of the interacting arms of their tRNA isoacceptors. The oldest acceptor (Acc) arm
interacts with the oldest catalytic domain and the more recent anticodon (AC) arm interacts with
the more recent AC-binding domain [21]; (b) Two codon systems evolved sequentially but acted
redundantly, one delimiting amino acid charging and the other codon speciﬁcity. Phylogenomic
analysis dissects their history [21]; (c) The ribosomal complex with ages of ribosomal proteins and
rRNA helices traced on an Escherichia coli structural model of the ribosomal core [11]. Note the very
ancient and central translocation core of helix 44 and ribosomal proteins S12 and S17; (d) Alphabet
evolution of the “standard” genetic code [21]. Ancestries of tRNA-aaRS binding were mapped most
parsimoniously onto the condensed Rodin & Rodin’s vis-a-vis degenerate genetic code representation,
taking into consideration anticodon loop identity elements. This timeline of late genetic code expansion
was indexed with major and minor groove modes of tRNA recognition in the aaRS enzymes. N = G, C,
U, A; V = G, C, A; R = G, A; Y = C, U; S = G, C.

(i) The history of aaRS catalytic, editing and anticodon-binding domains matched the history of
tRNA charging and encoding [21] (Figure 6a). These coevolutionary patterns allowed to infer a history
of progression of speciﬁcities for both the “operational” genetic code of the acceptor arm of tRNA
and the “standard” genetic code of the more derived anticodon-binding stem of tRNA (Figure 6b).
Since speciﬁcity determinants in tRNA result from interaction with the synthetases, the progression
describes the rise of the aminoacylation speciﬁcities of tRNA isoacceptors. The ﬁrst speciﬁcities
involved pre-transfer and post-transfer editing and trans-editing activities responsible of sieving
amino acids by size in the active sites of the catalytic domains of the synthetases. These speciﬁcities
involved 11 of the 20 standard amino acids, which were split into two groups. Group 1 speciﬁcities
were associated with the older type II tRNA structures holding a variable arm. Group 2 were associated
with standard type I tRNA cloverleaf structures. These interactions involved the acceptor stem of the
tRNA molecule, the oldest of the molecule [57]. They delimited the operational genetic code, probably
in absence of a fully functional ribosome and a full cloverleaf structure. In turn, codon speciﬁcities were
determined by speciﬁc anticodon binding domains in interaction with the more modern anticodon
stem of tRNA and appeared much later in the timeline, ~3 Gy-ago. The development of this more
modern “standard” genetic code produced its own timeline of codon speciﬁcities (Figure 6b). Thus,
protein history unfolded separate timelines of amino acid charging and codon recognition, which we
had already intimated in an earlier study [58], and revealed coevolution of the emerging domains and
nucleic acid cofactors.
(ii) A similar analysis of the evolution of the structure of rRNA and ribosomal proteins of the
small (SSU) and large (LSU) subunits of the ribosome produced an evolutionary timeline of accretion
of the universally conserved ribosomal complex [11] (Figure 6c). The age of rRNA helical regions
(see Figure 7a) and interacting domains of ribosomal proteins coevolved to form a fully functional
ribosomal core. The oldest protein (S12, S17, S9, L3) appeared together with the oldest rRNA
substructures responsible for decoding and ribosomal dynamics 3.3–3.4 Gy-ago. These structures
include the ratchet and two hinges of SSU rRNA and the L1 and L7/L12 stalks of LSU rRNA important
for ribosomal movement of tRNA in the complex. While protein-RNA coevolution manifested
throughout the timeline, the appearance of RNA substructures at ﬁrst occurred in orderly fashion
until the formation of a 10-way LSU and 5-way SSU junctions, at which point a “major transition” in
ribosomal evolution occurred 2.8–3.1 Gy-ago. This transition brought ribosomal subunits together
through inter-subunit bridge contacts. It also stabilized loosely evolving ribosomal components and
developed tRNA-interacting structures and a fully-ﬂedged peptidyl transferase center (PTC) with
exit pore capable of protein biosynthesis. Thus, ribosomal history also showed gradual coevolution
between RNA and proteins.
(iii) Coupling the evolutionary timelines of tRNA and rRNA structure with annotations of their
interactions with protein domains revealed that the tRNA cloverleaf structure was already fully formed
when the PTC appeared in evolution [59]. This was previously intimated directly from phylogenetic
analysis of ribosomal history [11]. Thus, fully formed tRNA molecules played other roles before being
recruited for processive protein biosynthesis, perhaps as cofactors of peptide-producing dipeptidases
and ligases. A more detailed elaboration of our data-driven hypothesis for the origin of translation
and genetics can be found elsewhere [9,21].
(iv) Finally, tracing ancestries of tRNA-aaRS binding in a condensed code representation of
primordial complementarity indexed with major/minor groove modes of tRNA recognition revealed
gradual evolution of the genetic code (Figure 6d). Mappings showed the early use of major groove
recognition and the second and ﬁrst codon positions. The early codes were associated with small and
hydrophobic amino acids. The coding of Pro, the founder, was based only on C and already used
second and ﬁrst code positions (identity elements G35 and G36). The code soon expanded into a
duplex code by adding G to its alphabet. The use of a third codon position (G34) for the ﬁrst time
with Thr and then His (the last two initial recruitments of the c.51.1.1 FF) expanded the alphabet to a
triplex code that used C, G and A. Finally, the “yin-yang” complementarity pattern of the condensed

20

Life 2016, 6, 43

code representation was ﬁnally fulﬁlled with the last recruitment of the a.27.1.1 FF once the modern
tetraplex code was in place.

The existence of two codes embedded in the acceptor stem and in the anticodon stem of tRNA
has recently received additional support from a study that shows that the acceptor and anticodon stem
determinants code for size and polarity of amino acid residues, respectively [60]. This matches the
differential encoding of information in the top and bottom half of the tRNA molecule and the role
of editing and anticodon binding recognition that differentiate these two sequential and apparently
redundant codes [21].
9. Accretion of tRNA Building Blocks Forms Functional Ribosomes

A recent study generated lists of non-overlapping alignments between tRNA and rRNA molecules
using a pairwise global alignment method implemented with the LALIGN algorithm without end
gap penalties and using default parameters [12]. The study uncovered a number of remote homology
hits, often overlapping, which suggested both subunits of the ribosome were built piecemeal from
primordial tRNA molecules (Figure 7). The ﬁnding is signiﬁcant as it supports the hypothesis
anticipated by David Bloch and his colleagues in the 80s that tRNA and rRNA shared a common
history [61]. It also supports recent ﬁndings of sequential and overlapping homologies of reconstructed
tRNA with the PTC core of LSU rRNA [62].
In order to explore how the tRNA accretion process gave rise to functional rRNA, we traced
the age of rRNA regions associated with relics of ancient tRNA building blocks (Figure 7). The ages
of rRNA substructures were taken directly from ref. [11]. The oldest structural regions present in
tRNA relics, for each relic, were highlighted as projections in the sequence of SSU and LSU rRNA
and colored according to rRNA helix age (nd), from red (nd = 0; oldest) to blue (nd = 1; youngest).
Relics were enriched in projections of old ribosomal regions (red, orange and yellow hues of the
projections) that preceded the rise of the PTC and the “major transition” in ribosomal evolution
(Figure 7). Note how projections of these old regions usually unify the many overlapping tRNA
homologies, suggesting tRNA building blocks may have been at the beginning smaller and then
slowly materialized into larger cloverleaf-like forms. In fact, and as we previously commented,
tracing ribosomal protein history and tRNA interactions with domains in the phylogenetic timelines
of ribosomal accretion revealed that a full-blown tRNA molecule was already interacting with the
ribosome at the time of the major ribosomal transition [59]. Note the existence of substantial tRNA
homology embedded in the PTC of LSU rRNA. Many tRNA homologies also showed substantial
matching to other functional regions, including the central ratchet and hinges of SSU rRNA and the
L1 and L7/12 stalks and the central protuberance (CP) of LSU rRNA that are involved in ribosomal
dynamics. The most numerous overlapping tRNA matches coincided with old structures and involved
tRNA with aminoacylation functions corresponding to the oldest Groups 1 and 2 that hold pre-transfer
and post-transfer editing and trans-editing activities. In particular, tRNA relics encoding Ser and
Leu were the most abundant (6 Leu and 5 Ser tRNAs, respectively) and matched the old central
functional regions, supporting the ancestrality of editing speciﬁcities for the charging of these two
amino acids (Figure 6b) and the proposal that they jumpstarted the “operational” genetic code [21].
This is expected since anticodon-binding domains responsible for major speciﬁcities of the standard
genetic code appeared after the ribosomal transition (Figure 2).
The ages of rRNA helices of the tRNA relics was also plotted against the age of tRNA isoacceptors
derived from phylogenetic constraint analysis [58], which dissects the history of Groups 1 and 2
speciﬁcities in the timeline of tRNA accretion (Figure 8). The plot makes evident the ancestral nature of
tRNA homologies and also shows the more recent tRNA recruitments. When considering homologies
in the oldest rRNA segments, a coevolutionary pattern between the age of tRNA and tRNA building
blocks of the ribosome appears evident (dashed line, Figure 8). The pattern suggests ribosomal
construction by tRNA recruitment began very early and made use very quickly of the entire repertoire
of tRNA isoacceptors derived from the editing speciﬁcities of their acceptor arms.
A close examination of Figure 7 allows postulating a succession of early cooption steps involving
emerging Groups 1 and 2 isoacceptors into the growing ribosome. The primordial ribosomal ratchet of
SSU and LSU moving parts (nd = 0–0.04) appeared to have been developed by cooptions of tRNALeu ,
22

MDPI Books

Life 2016, 6, 43

tRNASer , tRNAVal , tRNAPro , and tRNAAla homologies. Similarly, the more derived SSU rRNA hinges
(nd = 0.09–0.26) involved tRNAMet , tRNAIle , tRNAPhe , and tRNALys homologies. Finally, the rise of the
ribosomal PTC (nd = 0.28–0.30) involved accretion of tRNALeu , tRNASer , tRNATyr , tRNAPro , tRNAMet ,
tRNALys and tRNAThr homologies. The oldest Group 1 aminoacylation speciﬁcities appeared to have
been remembered in the oldest structures of the ribosome, while the more derived Group 2 speciﬁcities
are more abundant in later accretion steps.

Figure 8. Coevolution of the most ancient rRNA substructures and tRNA holding the oldest
aminoacylation functions (Groups 1 and 2) as these are pervasively coopted in rRNA. Ages were derived
from phylogenetic constraint analysis of tRNA molecules [58] and from the timeline of ribosomal
accretion inferred from the mappings of tRNA homologies to rRNA (see Figure 7). The more recent
Group 3 aminoacylation functions are not plotted but are enriched in the white quadrant of the plot.

10. Genomic Accretion of tRNA Building Blocks

When ancestral tRNA was translated in silico into proteins, its sequences showed homologies
to elongation factors, aaRS enzymes, enzymes of nucleotide biosynthesis pathways and RNA
polymerases [12]. Similar results were found in a separate study [63]. These remarkable results
suggest both tRNA and tRNA ribosomal relics hold deep phylogenetic information indicating they
both stored genetic information for ancient proteins and acted as ancient genomes. Modern biology
provides important clues to this very primordial role of tRNA. Dispersed repetitive elements, especially
those associated with tRNA, have the potential to spatially and functionally organize the genome by
providing barriers to chromatin structure, DNA replication, and contributing to fragile sites prone to
genomic rearrangements [64]. Synteny blocks in genomes, believed to be the result of chromosomal
rearrangements, are often ﬂanked by tRNA genes (e.g., [65]), suggesting an active role of tRNA
encodings in genomic make up. Transposable elements often exhibit homologies to tRNA and have
also active roles in the evolutionary restructuring of genomes [66]. The 3 -terminal ends of mRNAs
in mitochondrial DNA are often immediately continuous to tRNA genes, which likely punctuate the
polycistronic transcripts by endonucleolytic cleavage [67]. On this point, there is evidence that many
aaRSs not only bind to their respective tRNA in order to catalyze esteriﬁcation of the appropriate
cognate amino acid, but also bind to homologous sequences on their own mRNA in order to carry
out autogenous regulation of synthetase production. Examples include many of the Group 2 and 3
23

MDPI Books

Life 2016, 6, 43

tRNAs, including the aaRS for tRNAThr [68–79], tRNAAsp [80–83], tRNAHis [84], tRNAMet [74], and
tRNAPhe [85]. Many other aaRSs (especially those in Groups 1 and 2) are also regulated by direct
binding of the protein to genetic regulatory elements but not directly to their own mRNA [79,83].
Such autogenous control of synthetases provides additional evidence that tRNA may have played a
central role not only in the origins of the ribosome, but also in the origins of the genome that encodes
ribosome-related proteins. Finally, recent analysis of mimivirus transcripts shows tRNA genes are
expressed as polyadenylated messengers and follow a stringent “hairpin rule”, which extends to the
entire genome [86]. The ancestrality of giant viruses, and viruses in general [87], now suggests this
oddity is an ancient (not derived) feature of the mimivirus genome. All of these properties support
the crucial functional and structural role of genomic tRNA, boosting their ancient role as genomic
building blocks.
11. Ribosomal Structure Supports rRNA and Genomic Evolutionary Growth from Primordial
tRNA Pieces

The structural makeup of the ribosome provides information about its possible growth by covalent
joining of primordial tRNA pieces [26]. Identiﬁcation of putative insertions of “branch” helices onto
preexisting coaxially stacked “trunk” helices in crystallographic models of the ribosome showed that
not all insertions support the outward and gradual growth of ribosomal structures [88]. Seventeen
putative insertions suggest either evolutionary events of inward growth or the existence of “structural
grafting” of building blocks to build larger rRNA structures. The fact that these putative insertions
ﬂank regions with numerous tRNA homologies supports the idea that those building blocks were in
fact primordial tRNA molecules (D. Caetano-Anollés, ms. in preparation).
12. Conclusions

We have postulated a phylogenomic data-driven evolutionary scenario describing the rise of
translation and genetics [9]. It involves the lengthening of primordial cofactors into short RNA hairpins,
which slowly gained compositional speciﬁcities and evolved into longer nucleic acid polymers
protected by catalytic sites of the α/β/α-layered structures of archaic protein domains (summarized
in Figure 9). Similarly, primordial protein domains likely assembled from smaller loop subunits,
the EFLs [46]. This process of accretion of loop structures produced crucial domains, exempliﬁed
in the recently proposed emergence of class II aaRSs from three hairpin structures [89]. The initial
protein-nucleic acid interactions resulted in “ternary complexes” of primordial aaRSs, translation
factors, and tRNA, which aminoacylated tRNAs, ligated charged amino acids into dipeptides and
longer polymers, and gradually gained speciﬁcities to ensure compositional memories would be
preserved in proteins and interacting RNA [9]. These complexes were then “vectorially” transferred
to other molecular contexts, which would give rise to more complex NRPS-like and ribosomal-like
machinery. In particular, their interaction with newly formed OB-fold barrel structures produced an
ancestor of the central ribosomal ratchet of SSU rRNA and its S12 and S17 ribosomal protein partners
(the oldest of the ribosome) [11]. One important corollary of this scenario is that the speciﬁcities of
the genetic code developed through stereochemical interactions between nucleic acid and protein
molecules that were fully structured. In this regard and in line with the “self-referential model” for
the origin of the genetic code [90], pockets in the α/β/α-layered structures of archaic synthetases
were able to accommodate pairs of interacting RNA hairpins that were aminoacylated, catalyzing
peptide bond formation. We believe the molecular environment of structural pockets resembled those
of modern CDPSs, which foster the formation of tRNA-mediated dipeptidyl enzyme intermediates to
produce a wide variety of dipeptides [91].
In the present study, phylogenetic tracings of ancient tRNA homologies in the ribosome reveal
that cooption of emerging tRNA modules appears to be a protracted phenomenon responsible for both
ribosomal structure and RNA “templating” memory. It is likely that the dynamics of cooption at RNA
level responsible for rRNA and genomes, also brought with it interactions with emerging proteins
domains. This resulted in a growing ribonucleoprotein ribosomal complex that was built gradually
24

MDPI Books

and from smaller pieces through protein-nucleic acid coevolution. It is also likely that numerous
regulatory interactions involving tRNA mimicry at genomic level may have been established at this
very early stage as a primordial and labile epigenetic (“paragenetic” sensu Alexander Brink) mechanism.
These interactions evolved hand-in-hand with the emerging genetic machinery and ultimately gave
rise to “ﬁeld(s) of possibilities”, the genes of genomes [92].

Figure 9. Model of evolutionary growth of macromolecules from component parts leading to translation
machinery and genomes. Longer polypeptide molecules would have assembled from amino acids
and dipeptides by statistically biased condensations. Some of these produced elementary functional
loops (EFLs) capable of interacting with ligands and forming larger protein ensembles (EFLs with
variant sequences and structures are illustrated with differently colored loop backbones). Similarly,
proto-RNA molecules folding into small hairpins (stems are illustrated with solid bars and loops with
open circles) assembled from nucleotides in EFL-delimited pockets and were later ligated to form
larger RNA molecules serving as proto-genomes and proto-ribosomes. Interactions between RNA and
emerging proteins establish primordial structural correspondences. This code of genetic memory is
illustrated with red dashed lines. Black dashed arrows illustrate feed-forward catalytic activities.

Abstract: Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARSs) have evolved “quality control” mechanisms which
prevent tRNA aminoacylation with non-protein amino acids, such as homocysteine, homoserine, and
ornithine, and thus their access to the Genetic Code. Of the ten AARSs that possess editing function,
ﬁve edit homocysteine: Class I MetRS, ValRS, IleRS, LeuRS, and Class II LysRS. Studies of their
editing function reveal that catalytic modules of these AARSs have a thiol-binding site that confers
the ability to catalyze the aminoacylation of coenzyme A, pantetheine, and other thiols. Other AARSs
also catalyze aminoacyl-thioester synthesis. Amino acid selectivity of AARSs in the aminoacyl
thioesters formation reaction is relaxed, characteristic of primitive amino acid activation systems that
may have originated in the Thioester World. With homocysteine and cysteine as thiol substrates,
AARSs support peptide bond synthesis. Evolutionary origin of these activities is revealed by genomic
comparisons, which show that AARSs are structurally related to proteins involved in coenzyme
A/sulfur metabolism and non-coded peptide bond synthesis. These ﬁndings suggest that the extant
AARSs descended from ancestral forms that were involved in non-coded Thioester-dependent
peptide synthesis, functionally similar to the present-day non-ribosomal peptide synthetases.

1. Introduction

Each of the 20 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARSs) fulﬁls two important functions in the
initial steps in the translation of the Genetic Code: Chemical Activation and Information Transfer.
For example, methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS) catalyzes Chemical Activation of the carboxyl
group of its cognate amino acid methionine using ATP, which affords Met-AMP bound to the catalytic
module of MetRS (Figure 1). The Information Transfer function involves attachment of the activated
Met to the 3 adenosine of tRNA(CAU)Met according to the rules of the Genetic Code thereby matching
Met with its anticodon CAU, which is read by the AUG codon in the mRNA on the ribosome (Figure 1).
AARSs belong to two structurally unrelated classes, of ten enzymes each, which have different
catalytic domains indicating their independent evolutionary origin [1,2]. Class I AARSs usually
have monomeric structure with a Rossman-fold catalytic domain characterized by the HIGH and
KMSKS signature sequences. Class II AARSs have a two- or four-subunit quaternary structure and
an antiparallel β sheet catalytic domain with class II-deﬁning motifs. With the exception of LysRS

enzymes, which exist as a Class I or Class II structure in different organisms, other AARSs have a
class-speciﬁc structure in the three domains of life.

Figure 1. Chemical activation and information transfer by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARSs).

Catalytic domains of Class I and II AARSs exhibit pronounced differences in their modes of
substrate binding. For example, class I AARSs bind ATP in an extended conformation, while class
II AARSs bind ATP in a bent conformation with the γ-phosphate folding back over the adenine ring.
While Class I AARSs bind tRNA via the minor groove side of its amino acid acceptor stem helix,
Class II AARSs bind tRNA via the major groove side. Catalytic domains of Class I and II AARSs exhibit
also functional differences. Speciﬁcally, Class II AARS, such as LysRS, PheRS, HisRS, SerRS, and AspRS,
catalyze formation of diadenosine 5 ,5 -P1 ,P4 -tetraphosphate (AppppA) [3–5], a signaling molecule
that participates in transcriptional regulation of IgE-mediated immune response [6,7]. In contrast,
Class I AARSs, such as ArgRS and TrpRS, do not possess the AppppA synthetase activity or have
>10–100-fold lower activity (ValRS, MetRS, TyrRS) [4,5,8].
AARSs exhibit high selectivity for their cognate amino acid and tRNA substrates with error rates
in the section of amino acids and tRNAs of 10−4 to 10−5 and 10−6 , respectively [9–12]. Although in
general unambiguous translation according to the rules of the Genetic Code is crucial for cellular
homeostasis, some species have adapted to grow optimally in the presence of ambiguous translation
since, under stress conditions, higher error rates assure survival [13–15]. AARSs achieve unambiguous
pairing of amino acids with their cognate tRNAs by preferential binding of cognate amino acids
and a quality control [16] step, in which non-cognate amino acids are selectively edited [10,11,16,17].
The quality control step involves either pre-transfer or post-transfer mechanisms, or both [18]. The major
pre-transfer mechanism involves hydrolysis of AA~AMP at the catalytic domain, ﬁrst discovered for
ValRS, IleRS, and MetRS [18,19], while post-transfer mechanism involves hydrolysis of AA-tRNA at a
separate editing domain, originally discovered for IleRS [20] and PheRS [21]. Of the 20 extant AARSs,
ten possess an editing function which corrects errors in amino acid selection [22]. For some AARS
(IleRS, ValRS, or AlaRS), the editing function is conserved throughout the three domains of life, while
editing function of other AARSs (LeuRS, ProRS, or PheRS) is phylogenetically restricted ([23] and
references therein).
Editing by AARSs prevents access of non-proteinogenic amino acids such as homocysteine [24–28],
ornithine [29], homoserine [10,16], or norvaline [30] to the Genetic Code and effectively partitions
amino acids present in extant organisms into proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic amino acids. Natural
non-proteinogenic amino acids vastly outnumber the 20 canonical proteinogenic amino acids found in
all organisms, plus selenocysteine and pyrrolysine encoded in only some genomes [31]. Hundreds
of non-proteinogenic amino acids are known in various species [32]: about 240 in plants, 75 in fungi,
50 in animals, and 50 in prokaryotes [33].
Of the 10 AARS that possess the editing function, ﬁve edit the thiol amino acid homocysteine
(Hcy) at the catalytic domain: Class I MetRS, LeuRS, IleRS, ValRS, and Class II LysRS [10,11].
Other misactivated amino acids are edited at the catalytic domain, a dedicated editing domain,
or both [11,31]. Phylogenetic analyses of structural domains present in proteomes [34] suggest that
catalytic domains of AARSs belong to the oldest fold families and may have appeared about 3.7 billion
years ago, while separate domains that edit misacylated tRNA appeared later, about 3.2 billion years

ago [35] (these timelines are based on counting relative node, i.e., branch point, distance in the rooted
trees and using a molecular clock of protein folds to convert relative age into geological time [36]).
Because of their crucial role in the translation and maintenance of the Genetic Code, analysis
of AARSs structures and mechanisms of reactions catalyzed by AARSs can provide insights into the
origin and evolution of the Genetic Code [35,37]. The present article examines the links between Hcy
editing, thioester chemistry, and the origin of the amino acid activation for the coded protein synthesis.
Available data suggest that ancestral AARSs were involved in the thiol (coenzyme A, pantetheine)
aminoacylation reactions and thioester-based non-coded peptide synthesis before the emergence of
the Genetic Code and the ribosomal protein biosynthetic machinery.
2. Homocysteine (Hcy) is Edited by Class I and Class II Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetases (AARSs)

One of the selectivity problems in protein biosynthesis is discrimination against the
non-proteinogenic thiol amino acid Hcy, a universal precursor of methionine. Hcy is misactivated
(Reaction (1)) by Class I MetRS, IleRS, LeuRS [25,26], ValRS [18] and class II LysRS [10,11,29].
AARS + Hcy + ATPAARS • Hcy ∼ AMP + PPi

(1)

Misactivated Hcy is edited by an intramolecular reaction between the side chain thiolate and the
activated carboxyl of Hcy, affording the thioester Hcy-thiolactone (Reaction (2)) [18,38].

(2)

Hcy editing does not depend on tRNA [10,18], consumes one mole of ATP per mole
Hcy-thiolactone [38], and prevents attachment of Hcy to tRNA, and thus Hcy access to the
Genetic Code.
The energy of the anhydride bond of Hcy~AMP is conserved in the thioester bond of
Hcy-thiolactone. Consequently, Hcy-thiolactone easily reacts with free amino acids forming Hcy-AA
dipeptides [39,40] and with protein lysine residues forming N-Hcy-protein [39–41].
2.1. Hcy Editing is Universal

Hcy is an important intermediate in the metabolism of Met, Cys, and one-carbon units carried
on folates in Bacteria and Eukarya [41,42]. Hcy has also been shown to be an intermediate in Met
and Cys metabolism in Archaea methanogens [43]. Because Hcy is a non-coded amino acid, living
organisms must have evolved the ability to prevent its access to the Genetic Code. Indeed, in
bacteria (E. coli, M. smegmatis) [24,44], the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae [27], plants [45], mice [28], and
humans [28,46], Hcy is edited and metabolized to Hcy-thiolactone by MetRS. In E. coli and S. cerevisiae
Hcy thiolactone accumulation is proportional to the expression level of MetRS. In S. cerevisiae, both
cytoplasmic and mitochondrial MetRSs edit Hcy [47]. Editing of endogenous Hcy by MetRS in
cultured microbial and mammalian cells is prevented by supplementation with excess Met. In E. coli
cultures supplemented with Hcy, two other AARSs LeuRS and IleRS, in addition to MetRS, catalyze
Hcy-thiolactone formation [25,26]. As a result, Hcy-thiolactone formation is fully prevented only by
simultaneous supplementation with excess Ile, Leu, and Met.
In all organisms, including human, genetic deﬁciencies in the Hcy/Cys/Met pathways or
inadequate supply of cofactors of enzymes participating in Hcy metabolism (folate, cobalamin/vitamin
B12 , pyridoxal phosphate/vitamin B6 ) lead to the accumulation of Hcy and its metabolites, including
Hcy-thiolactone, which are implicated in cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases [41] through
mechanisms involving pro-atherogenic changes in gene expression [48], modiﬁcation of protein

33

structure [40] leading to amyloid formation [49], activation of mTORC1 signaling and inhibition of
autophagy [50], and induction of inﬂammatory and autoimmune responses [51–53].
Structural similarities between Archaeal and Bacterial MetRSs suggest that Hcy can also be edited
by Archaeal MetRSs. For example the catalytic domain of the Archeon Pyrococcus abyssi MetRS is
very similar to catalytic domains of E. coli and T. thermophilus MetRSs and can be superimposed
with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) values of 1.7 Å for 481 Cα atoms and 1.6 Å for 406 Cα
atoms, respectively. Residues important for the synthetic and editing functions of the Bacterial
MetRSs are conserved in the Archaeal MetRS and have similar positions in crystal structures [54],
including a glutamic acid residue, E259, in P. abyssi MetRS homologous to aspartic acid D259 residue
in E. coli MetRS, which participates as a mechanistic base in the Hcy editing reaction (discussed in
Section 2.2.1 below).
2.2. Mechanism of Hcy Editing

Hcy editing is unique in that it involves an intramolecular Reaction (2), in which the side chain
thiolate of Hcy molecule is a nucleophile, to accomplish editing. Editing reactions of all other amino
acids, including a related thio-amino acid Cys, are intermolecular and use water hydroxide as a
nucleophile [11]. Hcy is edited by the cyclization to Hcy-thiolactone at the synthetic/editing catalytic
site in the Rossman-fold domain of class I AARS [55,56] and at the β sheet catalytic domain of Class II
LysRS [29,38].
2.2.1. Methionyl-tRNA Synthetase (MetRS)

A model for pre-transfer Hcy editing explains how MetRS partitions Met and Hcy between the
synthetic and editing pathways, respectively. The model is supported by the crystal structure [57],
structure/function [55,56], and computational [58] studies of E. coli MetRS. In the synthetic pathway,
the activated carboxyl of Met reacts with the 2 -hydroxyl of the 3 -terminus of tRNAMet, affording
Met-tRNAMet. In the editing pathway, the activated carboxyl of Hcy reacts with the thiolate of its side
chain, affording Hcy~ thiolactone.
Whether an amino acid substrate completes the synthetic or editing pathway is determined by
the partitioning of its side chain between the speciﬁcity and thiol-binding subsites [55]. Met completes
the synthetic pathway because its side chain is bound by the hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding
interactions with W305 and Y15 residues in the speciﬁcity sub-site (Figure 2).

Figure 2. The synthetic/editing active site of E. coli methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS): Hydrophobic
and hydrogen-bonding interactions provide speciﬁcity for the cognate substrate L-methionine.

In contrast, the side chain of Hcy, missing the methyl group of Met, interacts weakly with the
speciﬁcity sub-site. This allows the side chain of Hcy to interact with D259 [58] in the thiol-binding
sub-site [55], which facilitates editing by cyclization to Hcy-thiolactone (Figure 3). Consistent with
this model, mutations of W305 and Y15 residues, which form the hydrophobic Met-binding sub-site,
reduce the Hcy/Met discrimination by the enzyme [56].

Figure 3. Editing of miscativated homocysteine (Hcy~AMP) at the catalytic module of an AARS: The
MetRS-catalyzed cyclization of homocysteinyl adenylate to form Hcy-thiolactone and AMP, which are
subsequently released from the synthetic/editing active site of MetRS.

Computational studies [58] suggest that D259 plays an essential role as a mechanistic base that
deprotonates the side chain thiol in Hcy~AMP at the catalytic module of MetRS (Figure 4). In the initial
MetRS·Hcy~AMP complex the distance SHcy ···OAsp259 (5.30 Å) is markedly shorter than the distance
SHcy ···Ophos in Hcy~AMP (7.15 Å) (Table 1). The rate-limiting step in Hcy-thiolactone formation
is the rotation about the Cβ −Cγ bond with 27.5 kJ·mol−1 energy barrier. This is more favorable
than 98.25 kJ·mol−1 energy barrier for an alternative substrate-assisted mechanism in which the
non-bridging oxygen of phosphate in Hcy~AMP acts as a base.

Cognate Met can also enter the editing pathway when the thiol-binding subsite is occupied by a
thiol mimicking the side chain of Hcy [55]. Under these circumstances the activated carboxyl and thiol
functions are on separate molecules and MetRS becomes a Met:thiol ligase that catalyzes synthesis of
Met thioesters (Figure 5).

Figure 5. Amino acid:coenzyme A (CoA-SH) ligase activity of MetRS. When the active site is occupied
by Met-tRNA or Met-AMP, and the thiol subsite is occupied by CoA-SH, MetRS catalyzes the formation
of Met-S-CoA thioester. An R represents the bulk of CoA-SH or other thiol molecule.

2.2.2. Leucyl-tRNA Synthetase (LeuRS), Isoleucyl-tRNA Synthetase (IleRS), Valyl-tRNA
Synthetase (ValRS)

A similar model explains Hcy editing [25,26] by related Class I AARS. ValRS, LeuRS, and IleRS
have active sites, D490, E532, and E550, respectively, that correspond to D359 of MetRS and are similarly
positioned with respect to the Ccarb center of the substrate Hcy~AMP [58]. Computational analyses
show that the Hcy~AMP substrate binds in their active sites in a linear conformation similar to that
observed for MetRS. The average Ccarb ···OAsp/Glu distances are within 1.16 Å of each other whereas all
SHcy ···Ccarb distances are within 1.24 Å of each other (Table 1). More importantly, for MetRS, LeuRS,
and ValRS, the average SHcy ···OAsp/Glu distance is signiﬁcantly shorter than the average SHcy ···Ophos
distance by 2.15 Å, 2.27 Å, and 2.06 Å, respectively. Thus, each of these Asp/Glu residues can act as a
mechanistic base that deprotonates the side chain thiol in Hcy~AMP and facilitate Hcy-thiolactone
formation by MetRS, LeuRS, and ValRS. However, it is less clear whether Glu550 can act as a base in
Hcy-thiolactone formation catalyzed by IleRS.
2.2.3. Lysyl-tRNA Synthetase (LysRS) Edits Homocysteine (Hcy), Ornithine (Orn), Homoserine (Hse),
but Mischarges tRNALys with Proteinogenic Amino Acids

Hcy editing occurs also at the β sheet catalytic domain of Class II E. coli LysRS [38], which also
edits Orn and Hse. Editing by LysRS is not affected by tRNALys and there is no tRNALys mischarging
with Hcy or Orn [29]. However, LysRS mischarges tRNALys with several other amino acids (Arg, Thr,
Met, Cys, Leu, Ala, or Ser) and does not deacylate mischarged Arg-tRNALys , Thr-tRNALys , and
Met-tRNALys . Recent data show that Met-tRNALys (and other tRNAs mischarged with Met) are
formed in E. coli and mammalian cells in response to stress conditions [13,14].

3. Expanding the Genetic Code: Decoding Methionine Codons by Homocysteine

By preventing the attachment of Hcy to tRNA, the editing reaction assures that Hcy is excluded
from the Genetic Code. Weak interactions of the side chain of Hcy with the speciﬁcity subsite allow
binding of the Hcy side chain to the thiol-binding subsite in the catalytic domain of MetRS [55,56].
Thus, modiﬁcations of the side chain of Hcy that increase binding to the speciﬁcity subsite should
prevent editing and facilitate the transfer to tRNAMet . This is achieved by S-nitrosylation of Hcy to
S-nitroso-Hcy (S-NO-Hcy), which binds to the MetRS with afﬁnity 10-fold greater than Hcy and
is activated by MetRS to form S-NO-Hcy~AMP [59]. In contrast to Hcy-AMP which is edited,
S-NO-Hcy~AMP is resistant to editing due to stronger binding to the speciﬁcity subsite which leads to
the transfer of S-NO-Hcy to tRNAMet , affording S-NO-Hcy~tRNAMet (Figure 6).

Figure 6. Aminoacylation of tRNA with S-NO-Hcy catalyzed by MetRS [59].

The S-NO-Hcy-tRNAMet has a similar susceptibility to spontaneous deacylation as Met~tRNAMet
with a half-life of 28 min. De-nitrosylation of S-nitroso-Hcy~tRNAMet affords Hcy~tRNAMet , the least
stable aminoacyl-tRNA known, which spontaneously deacylates with a half-life of 15 s to form
Hcy-thiolactone and free tRNAMet .
As expected, S-NO-Hcy~tRNAMet is a substrate for protein synthesis on ribosomes, which allows
translational incorporation of S-NO-Hcy into protein at positions normally occupied by Met [59].
For example, when cultures of E. coli metE mutant cells (unable to metabolize Hcy to Met) expressing
mouse dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) protein were supplemented with S-NO-Hcy, the DHFR protein
was found to contain Hcy. Control experiments in which E. coli metE cultures were supplemented with
Hcy or Hcy-thiolactone, instead of S-NO-Hcy, show that there is no incorporation of Hcy into bacterial
proteins [59]. Globin and luciferase, produced in an in vitro mRNA-programmed rabbit reticulocyte
protein synthesis system supplemented with S-NO-Hcy~tRNAMet contain Hcy at positions normally
occupied by Met.
Translationally incorporated Hcy has also been identiﬁed in protein from cultured human vascular
endothelial cells (HUVECs) (Table 2), which endogenously produce nitric oxide and S-nitroso-Hcy [60].
Translationally incorporated Hcy is resistant to Edman degradation whereas post-translationally
incorporated Hcy (by the reaction of Hcy-thiolactone with protein lysine residues [40]) is not (Table 2,
last row) last, which allows to distinguish between the two mechanisms [61].

Taken together, these ﬁndings show that Hcy can gain an access to the Genetic Code by nitric
oxide-mediated invasion of the methionine-coding pathway [59].
4. AARSs Support the Aminoacylation of Thiols and Peptide Bond Synthesis
4.1. Methionyl-tRNA Synthetase (MetRS)

In the model of pre-transfer Hcy editing by MetRS, the side chain thiol of Hcy-AMP is bound to
D259 at the thiol-binding subsite (Figure 4). When the cognate Met occupies the catalytic site of MetRS,
the thiol-binding site is vacant. A prediction of this model is that activated Met (i.e., Met~tRNA or
Met~AMP), which binds in the synthetic mode, will enter the editing pathway when the thiol-binding
sub-site is ﬁlled by a thiol mimicking the side chain of Hcy (Figure 5).
This prediction is conﬁrmed by ﬁndings showing that MetRS has the ability to catalyze the transfer
of Met from Met~AMP or Met~tRNA to a variety of thiols with the formation of Met thioesters [55,63],
i.e., has a Met:CoA-SH ligase activity (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1. Aminoacylation of thiols catalyzed by an AARS.

The thiol-binding site exhibits a remarkable selectivity for coenzyme A (CoA-SH) and cysteine,
which are the preferred thiol substrates forming Met~S-CoA thioester and MetCys dipeptide,
respectively. The formation of thioesters and dipeptides exhibits saturation kinetics with respect
to thiols, characteristic of enzymatic reactions. Rates of the thiol aminoacylation reaction approach
the rate of Hcy editing by MetRS (kcat = 1 s−1 ). The rate enhancement by MetRS of the aminoacyl
thioester formation reaction is up to 1,000,000-fold [55]. Pantetheine is a 22-fold less catalytically
efﬁcient substrate than CoA-SH, indicating that the adenine nucleotide portion of CoA-SH structure is
important for the Met~S-CoA thioester formation. DesulfoCoA, a CoA-SH analogue without the thiol,
is not aminoacylated, indicating absolute requirement of the CoA-SH thiol [63].
With Cys as a thiol substrate and with Met~tRNA or Met-AMP in the active site, MetRS catalyzes
the aminoacylation of Cys thiol with Met, forming Met~S-Cys thioester, which then rearranges to
MetCys dipeptide. Facile intramolecular reaction results from the favorable geometric arrangement
of the α-NH2 of Cys with respect to the thioester bond in Met~S-Cys (Scheme 2). That Met~S-Cys
thioester is an intermediate is supported by the ﬁnding that Met-S-mercaptopropionate thioester forms
with 3-mercaptopropionic acid (an analogue of Cys missing the NH2 group) as a thiol substrate.
With Hcy as a thiol substrate, MetHcy dipeptide is formed by a similar mechanism [55]. CysGly
dipeptide is also aminoacylated by MetRS forming MetCysGly tripetide [55].

Active site residues of MetRS that are important for catalysis of the synthetic reactions (Hcy~AMP,
Met~AMP, and Met~tRNA formation) and Hcy editing (Hcy-thiolactone formation) are also important
for the Met-thioester formation reactions.
That Met and thiols bind at different sites is supported by the non-competitive inhibition of the
thioester formation reaction by Met, which affects the kcat but not Km for Cys [55].
4.2. IleRS, ValRS, LysRS

In addition to MetRS, other Hcy-editing AARSs have the ability to catalyze the synthesis of
aminoacyl~S-thioesters and aminoacyl-Cys dipeptides (Table 3). For example, with CoA-SH as a
thiol, substrate Class I IleRS [55,64] and ValRS [64], and Class II LysRS [64], catalyze the synthesis
of Ile~S-CoA, Val~S-CoA, and Lys~S-CoA thioesters, respectively. With Cys as a thiol substrate,
ValRS, IleRS, and LysRS catalyze the synthesis of ValCys [65], IleCys [65,66], LysCys [38] dipeptides,
respectively (Scheme 2).
However, in contrast to their high selectivity in the tRNA aminoacylation reaction, AARSs
exhibit relaxed amino acid selectivity in the CoA-SH aminoacylation reaction (Table 4). For example,
IleRS aminoacylates CoA-SH with noncognate Val, Leu, Thr, Ala, and Ser in addition to the cognate
isoleucine. The catalytic efﬁciencies for the non-cognate amino acids are only 10-fold (for Val)
to 370-fold (for Thr) lower than the catalytic efﬁciency for the cognate isoleucine in the CoA-SH
aminoacylation reaction. ValRS is even less selective and catalyzes aminoacylation of CoA-SH with
threonine, alanine, serine, and isoleucine, in addition to valine (Table 4) with catalytic efﬁciencies only
2.4-fold (for Thr) to 28-fold (for Ile) lower than the catalytic efﬁciency for the cognate Val.

LysRS is the least selective and aminoacylates CoA-SH with noncognate leucine, threonine,
alanine, valine, and isoleucine, in addition to the cognate lysine. The rates of transfer of noncognate leucine
and threonine are faster than the rate of lysine transfer to CoA-SH, while other noncognate amino acids are
transferred by LysRS at rates only 1.1- to 8-fold slower. The aminoacylation of CoA-SH with noncognate
amino acids is prevented by the cognate amino acid, indicating that the ability to aminoacylate CoA-SH
with a noncognate amino acid is an inherent property of IleRS, ValRS, and LysRS [64]. Apparently,
binding of CoA-SH relaxes the selectivity of the amino acid substrate-binding site, whereas binding of
tRNA increases the selectivity towards the cognate amino acid. The relaxed amino acid selectivity is
indicative of a more primitive aminoacylation system involving CoA-SH that may have originated in a
Thioester World (Section 9).
4.3. Arginyl-tRNA Synthease (ArgRS), Aspartyl-tRNA Synthetase (AspRS), Seryl-tRNA Synthetases (SerRS)

Surprisingly, AARSs that do not misactivate/edit Hcy also have the ability to catalyze the thiol
aminoacylation reactions (Table 3). For example, Class I ArgRS [65] catalyzes aminoacylation of Cys,
cysteamine, Hcy, and other thiols. With Cys or Hcy as thiol substrates ArgRS catalyzes the synthesis of
ArgCys and ArgHcy dipeptides with Arg~S-Cys and Arg~S-Hcy thioesters as intermediates formed
by a mechanism analogous to that depicted in Scheme 2 for MetRS. The rate enhancement by ArgRS of
the Arg-thioester formation reaction with Cys is >3300-fold. Remarkably, the aminoacylation of Cys
exhibits some degree of stereospeciﬁcity with a 6-fold preference for L-Cys vs. D-Cys. Further, ArgRS
has the ability to add Arg to N-terminal Cys of Cys-Gly dipeptide forming ArgCysGly tripeptide [65].
Class II AspRS catalyzes aminoacylation of CoA-SH, pantetheine, Cys, and Hcy with Asp, forming
Asp~S-CoA and Asp~S-pantetheine [63] thioesters, and AspCys [38,63] and AspHcy [38] dipeptides,
respectively. Although other thiols are aminoacylated with Asp by AspRS, CoA-SH, pantetheine, and
cysteine are the preferred substrates [63]. Similar to ArgRS [65], the AspRS-catalyzed aminoacylation
of Cys is stereospeciﬁc, with a 10-fold preference for L-Cys vs. D-Cys.
Class II SerRS [63] catalyzes aminoacylation of Cys and other thiols. Aminoacylation of Cys
catalyzed by SerRS leads to the formation of SerCys dipeptide with Ser~S-Cys thioester as an
intermediate (Scheme 2). The rate enhancements by SerRS, AspRS, and LysRS of the aminoacyl
thioester formation reaction are up to 30,000-fold [38]. Thus, the ability to aminoacylate CoA-SH,
Cys, Hcy, and other thiols is a general feature of the catalytic domains of both Class I and Class II
AARSs [10,11,62].
The thioester chemistry of AARSs underlying their ability to support synthesis of dipeptides, is
reminiscent of the adenylation domains of non-ribosomal thio-template peptide synthetases [69,70],
which belong to the ANL superfamily that also includes ﬁreﬂy luciferase and acyl-CoA synthetases,
but is structurally unrelated to AARS families. However, as discussed in Sections 5–7 below, genomic
comparisons reveal that AARSs are structurally related to enzymes participating in coenzyme A/sulfur
metabolism and peptide bond synthesis, which has important evolutionary implications and sheds a
light on the origin of coded peptide synthesis, discussed in Section 9.
5. Class I AARS Are Related to Proteins Involved in Sulfur/CoA Metabolism

The ribosomal translation apparatus is the most conserved component of cellular
metabolism [1,37,71]. Its core components, including Class I and Class II AARSs and ribosomes,
belong to the oldest fold families that can be traced back to the last universal common ancestor (LUCA)
of life and were the earliest systems to evolve into a form close to that of the present day before
the divergence of the three kingdoms of life from the LUCA [1,34,35,72]. Phylogenetic analyses of
structural domains present in proteomes [34] and of substructures of RNA molecules [35] suggest that
catalytic domains of AARSs have appeared before the ribosome [34,35]. The evolution of AARS from
their respective common ancestors must have predated the LUCA [73,74].
The catalytic domain of Class I AARSs includes a three-layered α/β/α domain with ﬁve core
β-strands in the order 3-2-1-4-5 surrounded by four α-helices (Figure 7). The signature HIGH motif is

40

MDPI Books

Life 2017, 7, 6

located in the loop between strand 1 and helix 1. Class I AARSs also have an extension that consists
of a loop, containing the KMSKS motif, followed by two helices C-terminal to the α/β/α domain.
The HIGH and KMSKS motifs are also present in a diverse family of nuclotidyltransferases. Genomic
and structural comparisons show that catalytic domains of Class I AARSs and nucleotidyltransferases
form a distinct HIGH superfamily that is related to two other superfamilies: PP-ATPases, a diverse
superfamily of domains that catalyze reactions involving hydrolysis of the α-β pyrophosphate bond
in ATP, and USPA-like group, that includes USPA domains, electron transport ﬂavoproteins, and
photolyases. Together these superfamilies comprise a distinct class of α/β/α domains designated the
HUP (HIGH-signature proteins, UspA, and PP-ATPase) domain [73] (Figure 7). Similarities between
these protein families were initially detected using structural comparisons but can also be detected at
the sequence level. A structure-based multiple sequence alignment shows that speciﬁc features of the
HUP domain include a core of ﬁve β-strand sheet in the 3-2-1-4-5 order and four α-helices, horizontal
depression of β-strand 3 with respect to the rest of the sheet, crossover of β-strand 4 and 5 or their
extensions, a sequence motif corresponding to β-strand 4 with a conserved small amino acid residue
at its C-terminus, and ATP ligand (Figure 7). These features distinguish the HUP family from other
domains with a Rossman-fold-like geometry (Figure 8) and suggest a monophyletic origin of the HUP
domains [73].

Figure 7. Topological display of the catalytic core of the HUP (HIGH-signature proteins, UspA,
and PP-ATPase) domain proteins. Adapted with permission from reference [73].

In addition to Class I AARSs, the HIGH superfamily family includes protein families involved
in CoA-SH biosynthesis such as panthotenate synthase (pantoate-β-alanine ligase) PanC [75],
phosphopantetheine adenosyltransferase PPAT [76], and sulfate metabolism (sulfate adenylyltransferase
SAT1) [73]. The HIGH superfamily is a distinct lineage within the HUP family (Figure 8), characterized
by the HIGH motif between β-strand 1 and α-helix 1, and a two-helix extension at the C-terminus
of the core domain via a loop with a KMSKS or related sequence involved in nucleotide binding
(Figure 7). The second lysine of the KMSKS motif is almost always present in Class I AARSs but
absent in other members of the HIGH superfamily, consistent with different modes of interaction with
ATP phosphates.
An evolutionary link between Class I AARSs and enzymes of CoA metabolism is revealed by a
structure-based alignment of amino acid sequences of PanC, PPAT, GluRS, GlnRS, and TyrRS, which
shows that sequences corresponding to the HIGH and KMSKS signature motifs are present, although
the KMSKS motif is only evident in structural alignment [75]. Serine at position three and basic
or hydroxyl function at positions four and ﬁve of the KMSKS motif are conserved in all structures.
The superposition of crystallographic structures of CoA-SH biosynthetic enzymes (pantothenate
synthtase PanC, phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase PPAT) and Class IAARSs (GluRS, GlnRS,
TyrRS) shows that the highest ranking structural matches to the Cα coordinates of the N-terminal
domain of E. coli PanC are the ATP-binding domains of T. thermophilus GluRS, GlnRS, and TyrRS, E. coli

GlnRS, B. stearothermphilus TyrRS, and E. coli PPAT [75]. Although sequence identities are low (10.8% to
14.5%), these structures are very similar with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of Cα atoms of 1.5
to 2.2 Å over 62–76 residues (Table 5).

Figure 8. Evolutionary scenario (cladogram) for the HUP domain class (HIGH-signature proteins,
UspA, and PP-ATPase). The speciﬁc characters associated with each of the nodes as derived through
the cladistic analysis are as follows. Node 1 (the HUP domain): presence of a core 5-strand sheet in
the 3–2–1–4–5 order; Node 2: conﬁguration of the region between the last helix and strand of the HUP
domain, strand 4 and 5 hydrogen-bonded through most of their lengths; Node 3: HIGH motif in the
loop between strand 1 and helix 1, bihelical extension C-terminal to the core HUP domain, with a
secondary role in nucleotide-binding; Node 4: loop between strand 3 and helix 4 tends to face outward,
helix 4 tends to be placed behind the central sheet, no strongly conserved motif between strand-1
and helix-1, possible loss of ability to hydrolyze α–β bond in ATP; Node 5: nucleotidyl transferase
activity, two small residues in the KMSKS loop; Node 6: AARS activity, classical KMSKS motif; Node 7:
insertion of a β-hairpin between helix 4 and strand 5; Node 8: fusion with large, α-helical C-terminal
domain; Node 9: distinct loop between strand 4 and helix 4; Node 10: SXGXDS motif between strand-1
and helix-1, conserved helix N-terminal to strand 1. The conserved families and their probable temporal
points of origin are shown for each of the six major lineages. Dotted ellipses and lines leading to a

Catalytic domains of class I AARSs are also similar to proteins involved in sulfate assimilation
for cysteine biosynthesis such as sulfate adenosyltransferase [77] in the HIGH superfamily
and 3 -phosphoadenosine-5 -phosphosulfate reductase [78] in the PP-LOOP superfamily [73].
These ﬁndings suggest an evolutionary link between class I AARSs and sulfur metabolism.
Analysis of patters of phyletic distribution of distinct families within these major lineages
(Figure 8) suggests that the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) of modern life encoded
15–18 α/β ATPases and nucleotide-binding proteins of the HUP domain. This points to an extensive
radiation of HUP domains before the LUCA, during which class I AARSs emerged at a later stage [73].
This also suggests that substantial evolutionary diversiﬁcation of protein domains occurred well before
the present-day version of protein-dependent translation apparatus was established, possibly in the
Thioester World (Section 9).
6. AARSs Are Related to Proteins Involved in Peptide Bond Synthesis
6.1. Class I AARSs

Two peptide bond-forming systems related to Class I AARSs have been identiﬁed. The ﬁrst system
includes mycothiol synthase MshC, a Class I CysRS paralogue that functions independently of tRNA.
MshC activates Cys with ATP, forming Cys~AMP, and then transfers the activated Cys to an amino
group of glucosamine in the mycothiol biosynthetic pathway [79,80]. MshC shares 36.1% primary
sequence identity to CysRS. Crystallographic structure of MshC is similar to that of CysRS and other
Class I AARSs with the catalytic Rossman-fold domain of ﬁve-stranded parallel β-sheet surrounded
by α-helices [81]. A superposition of MshC and CysRS structures, excluding the anticodon-binding
domain of CysRS, shows an RMSD of 2.70 Å for overlapping α-carbon atoms [80].
The second system includes cyclic dipeptide synthetases (CDPs) [82], a group of enzymes
belonging to the HUP superfamily of Rosmanoids folds, related to catalytic domains of Class I
TyrRS and TrpRS. The CDPSs participate in biosynthesis of biologically active diketopiperazines such
as albonoursin (Alb) in Streptomyces noursei, pulcherrimin in Bacillus subtilis, and mycocyclosin in
Mycobacterium tuberculosis [82,83]. CDPs do not activate amino acids, but use aminoacyl~tRNAs,
synthesized by canonical AARSs, to form cyclodipeptides. The synthesis of the cyclo(Phe-Leu)
dipeptide, the ﬁrst step of the albonoursin [cyclo(α,β-dehydroPhe-α,β-dehydroLeu)] biosynthetic
pathway is catalyzed by AlbC, which transfers Phe from Phe~tRNAPhe to the conserved Ser37.
The Phe-AlbC intermediate reacts with Leu~tRNALeu , forming a dipeptidyl-AlbC, which undergoes
intramolecular cyclization to generate the cyclo(Phe-Leu) dipeptide [84]. AlbC can also incorporate
Tyr and Met from the corresponding AA-tRNAs into cyclodipeptides [82,83].
In some actinomycetes (Actinosynnema mirum and Streptomyces sp. AA4), the AlbC-like CDP
genes are associated with genes encoding an acyl-CoA ligase [85]. The acyl-CoA ligase family
of enzymes activates carboxyl groups with ATP and then transfers them to CoA-SH, forming
acyl~S-CoA thioesters. Thus, this neighborhood association suggests that these CDPS might use
aminoacyl~S-CoA (generated by an acyl:CoA-SH ligase) as substrate for dipeptide synthesis, rather
than aminoacyl~ tRNAs.
Genomic comparisons also identiﬁed bacterial Class I MetRS paralogues [85] that are proposed
to participate in the synthesis of a dipeptide through the condensation of Met~AMP with the α-NH2
group of a lysine derivative acetylated at the ε-NH2 . These MetRS paralogues are often found in
operons containing non-ribosomal peptide synthetases and acyl-CoA ligases, which could charge
CoA-SH with amino acids for use by the peptide synthetases [85].
6.2. Class II AARSs

Two other peptide bond-forming systems related to Class II AARSs have also been identiﬁed.
The ﬁrst system uses aminoacyl~tRNA while the second uses aminoacyl~AMP for the peptide bond
formation. The ﬁrst system includes a SerRS paralogue VlmL while the second system includes

43

MDPI Books

Life 2017, 7, 6

biotin-protein ligase BirA, a SerRS paralogue; PoxA, a LysRS paralogue; and an AspRS/AsnRS
paralogue AsnA.
VlmL is a dedicated SerRS that produces Ser~tRNASer that is used by VlmA in transferring serine
to isobutylhydroxylamine in biosynthesis of the antibiotic valanimycin by Streptomyces viridifaciens [86].
VlmL is essential and cannot be substituted by the canonical SerRS, suggesting that VlmL-VlmA
complex formation is required for the VlmA function.
BirA is a protein ligase that attaches biotin to Nε-amino group of lysine residues of metabolic
proteins involved in caboxylation or decarboxylation, e.g., acyl-CoA carboxylase [87]. Biotin is
activated with ATP, forming BirA•biotin~AMP. The catalytic domain of BirA (residues 60–270) includes
seven-stranded β-sheet and ﬁve α-helices with topology identical [87] to that observed in the catalytic
domain of SerRS [88]. The RMSD for the superposition of 31 α-carbon atoms in the sheet of both
structures is very low, 1.17 Å, indicating that the twist and curvature of the β-sheet are very similar.
Two α-helices on sides of the sheet are also topologically equivalent and occur in the same sequence
order. The binding sites for biotin in BirA and Ser~AMP analogue in SerRS occupy equivalent positions
with respect to the β-sheet. Structural and functional similarities between BirA and SerRS suggest that
their catalytic domains diverged from a common ancestor [87].
PoxA is a LysRS paralogue, the ﬁrst known AARS paralogue that modiﬁes a protein with an amino
acid, transfers β-lysine to the ε-NH2 group of a conserved Lys34 residue of translation elongation
factor P [89,90]. β-Lysine is ﬁrst activated with ATP, forming β-Lys~ AMP.
AsnA is an AspRS/AsnRS paralogue [91] that activates β-carboxyl of aspartic acid with ATP to
form β-Asp~AMP and then transfers β-aspartate to ammonia forming asparagine.
7. Thioester Chemistry of SerRS Homologues from Methanogenic Archaea

Genome sequences of methanogenic archaea encode AA:CP ligases homologous to the catalytic
domain of Class II SerRS [92], which aminoacylate the thiol of phosphopantetheine prosthetic group
of a carrier protein (CP) with Gly or Ala, but do not aminoacylate tRNA. CP is encoded in the same
operon that encodes the AA:CP ligase in the bacterial chromosome. These AA:CP ligases support the
aminoacyl-thioester formation reaction similar to the CoA-SH/pantetheine aminoacylation reactions
catalyzed by canonical AARSs (Scheme 1). Crystallographic studies show the pantetheine thiol arm
enters the AA:CP ligase active site from the opposite direction relative to the entry of the 3 -end of
tRNA in the canonical SerRS, a mode of interaction predicted for CoA-SH and tRNA within the active
sites of AARSs. Further, similar to AARSs, AA:CP ligases catalyze aminoacylation of free CoA-SH
and Cys with Ala and Gly, forming AA~S-CoA (Scheme 1) and AA-Cys dipeptides (Scheme 2),
respectively [93], indicating that AA:CP ligases are both structurally and functionally related to
canonical class II SerRS. These similarities suggest that catalytic domains of present-day AARSs may
have evolved from ancestral forms that functioned as AA:CoA-SH ligases and represent molecular
fossils that originate from an ancient catalytic domain that utilized thioester chemistry to activate
amino acids for non-coded peptide bond synthesis, before acquiring the ability to aminoacylate tRNA.
The AA:CoA-SH ligase activities of extant AARSs and CPs appear to be vestiges of an evolutionary
link between thioester-dependent and RNA-dependent peptide synthesis [63,64].
8. Acyl~S-CoA Thioesters and Aminoacyl~tRNA Esters are Used in Peptide Bond Synthesis
Catalyzed the Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferases (GNAT) Fold Enzymes

The Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferases (GNAT) are a superfamily of enzymes that are universally
distributed in nature and use acyl~S-CoA to acylate their cognate substrates [94]. These include histone
acetyltransferases, ribosomal protein S18 Nα-acetyltransferase (RimI), protein N-myristoyltransferase,
aminoglycoside N-acetyltransferases, serotonin N-acetyltransferase, glucosamine-6-phosphate
N-acetyltransferase, mycothiol synthase (MshD), and the Fem family of amino acyl transferases.
MshD catalyzes the ﬁnal step in mycothiol biosynthesis, the acetylation of the α-amino group of
cysteine attached to glucosamine part of mycothiol using acetyl~S-CoA as a substrate [95].

Crystallographic studies of the GNAT fold proteins with bound acetyl-S-CoA or CoA-SH
show that the GNAT fold is a phosphopantetheine-binding domain [95], which contains a central
ﬁve-β-stranded mixed polarity sheet with four α-helices (Figure 9) [94]. Two of the α-helices lie on top
of the β-sheet aligned in parallel with the β-strands. The other two helices are stacked on the bottom
of the β-sheet with one α-helix aligned in parallel with the β-strands and the other at a 60◦ angle.
The GNAT fold has two distinct binding sites: one for the pyrophosphate moiety of CoA-SH with a
signature motif Q/RxxGxG/A and another site for the pantetheine arm. The pyrophosphate-binding
is located at a loop between β-strand 4 and α-helix 3, while the pantetheine arm-binding site is located
between β-strands 4 and 5, which splay apart to allow the pantetheine arm to make pseudo β-sheet
interactions with the exposed backbone atoms of β-strand 4 (Figure 9).

are colored green (β1, α1, α2), yellow (β2–4), red (α3, β5) and blue (α4, β6). The dark green (β0)
N-terminal strand is not completely conserved and the deep blue C-terminal strand may be from the
same monomer, or contributed by another; (B) Superposition of 15 GNAT structures. Residues in
which the RMSD is <2.7 Å are highlighted in red; (C) Yeast Hat1 histone acetyltransferase in complex
with Ac-S-CoA (1BOB.pdb). Reproduced with permission from reference [94].

However, the GNAT fold of some proteins binds tRNA, instead of CoA-SH [96,97]. For example,
FemABX ligases of the GNAT fold (Figure 10) use aminoacyl~tRNAs as substrates for peptide ligation
in the cell wall peptidoglycan synthesis in the Gram-positive bacteria. The Fem ligases catalyze
the addition of L-amino acids and glycine from aminoacyl-tRNAs synthesized by AARSs to the
ε-amino group of lysine in the pentapeptide (L-Ala-D-γ-Glu-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala) of a peptidoglycan.
Unfortunately, details of tRNA-GNAT fold interaction are not known, because the structures of any of
those proteins in complexes with tRNA are not yet available.

Figure 10. Superposition of FemX (red) with S. aureus FemA (yellow, PDB 1LRZ). The overall structures
are similar: RMSD is 2.8 Å for the 309 Cα atoms). The major structural difference is the absence in
FemX of the coiled-coil region constituted by two helices (residues 246–307; found in SerRS) inserted in
FemA domain 2. Reproduced with permission from reference [97].

Another member of the FemABX family, Phe/Leu transferase, uses aminoacyl-tRNA to transfer
these amino acids to the N-terminal amino acid of proteins, usually lysine or arginine [98,99].
A structure-based search shows that FemX and Phe/Leu transferases have similar structures
(Figure 11).

the FemX transferase structure is colored red and depicted as a ball-and-stick model. The L-Lys of
UDP-MPP is shown in pale cyan. The two structures superimpose with RMSD of 2.7 Å. Reproduced
with permission from reference [99].

Despite their low sequence identity, 12%, the C-terminal domain of Phe/Leu transferase has a
core region, formed by six β-strands and four α-helices, found in the GNAT family proteins, which is
involved in CoA-SH binding. C-terminal domains of Phe/Leu transferase and FemX superimpose
with an RMSD of 2.7 Å for the conserved GNAT fold.
The GNAT superfamily proteins provide the second example of a protein fold, the ﬁrst being the
Rossman-fold in AARSs, which can evolve to bind both CoA-SH and tRNA.
9. Evolutionary Implications

As discussed in Section 4, Class I ArgRS and CysRS as well as class II AspRS and SerRS do not
possess the Hcy editing function but nevertheless have the ability to catalyze the thiol aminoacylation
reaction. This suggests that these AARSs possess a vestigial thiol-binding site, functionally similar
to the thiol binding sites of Class I MetRS, ValRS, LeuRS, and IleRS. The ability of extant AARSs to
catalyze the synthesis of aminoacyl thioesters and peptides suggests a vestigial thiol-dependent peptide
synthesizing function, reminiscent of non-ribosomal peptide synthesis involving thioesters [69,70,100].
46

Life 2017, 7, 6

The AA:thiol ligase activity of the present-day AARSs suggests an evolutionary link between
thioester-dependent and RNA-dependent peptide synthesis. Another example of a link between
thioester-dependent and RNA-dependent peptide synthesis is provided by the GNAT fold superfamily
of enzymes, discussed in Section 8. Taken together, these ﬁndings suggest that ancestral AARSs may
have functioned as AA:pantetheine or AA:CoA-SH ligases before acquiring the ability to aminoacylate
tRNA. CoA-SH itself appears to be a primitive analogue of tRNA [101] in that both molecules can
carry amino acids for peptide bond synthesis [63]. Consistent with this scenario are the ﬁndings that
IleRS, ValRS, and LysRS exhibit relaxed amino acid selectivity in the CoA-SH aminoacylation reaction,
expected of a more primitive amino acid activating system in contrast to essentially absolute selectivity
of IleRS and ValRS in the tRNA or RNA-minihelix aminoacylation reactions [64].
9.1. Prebiotic Synthesis of Amino Acids and Organosulfur Compounds

Classical spark discharge experiments have established that amino acids are produced under
possible primitive Earth conditions [102]. Organosulfur compounds are also formed under simulated
prebiotic conditions [103] (Figure 12). For instance, methionine is formed on a simulated primitive
Earth atmosphere containing methane, nitrogen, ammonia, water, and H2 S or CH3 SH subjected to
spark discharges [104]. Cysteine forms in gas mixtures containing methane, ethane, ammonia, water,
and hydrogen sulﬁde irradiated with long-wavelength ultraviolet light [105]. Amino acids can also
form on pyrite or other metal sulﬁdes under simulated volcanic conditions [106]. However, organic
sulfur-containing amino acids are formed more readily in H2 S-containing primitive atmospheres [107].

amino acids and organosulfur compounds relative to glycine. Letter amino acid abbreviations are used.

Acrolein is also a product of the spark discharge and is thought to be an intermediate in the
prebiotic synthesis of methionine and Hcy [104], in addition to homoserine, glutamic acid and
α,γ-diaminobutyric acid. Analysis of samples from an unreported 1958 Stanley Miller experiment
shows that homocysteic acid, cysteamine, S-methyl-cysteine, ethionine, methionine sulfoxide and
sulfone, in addition to methionine, form under prebiotic conditions [109]. Components of CoA-SH
(β-alanine, pantoyl lactone cysteamine, and adenosine) are known to be likely prebiotic compounds.
The pantetheine moiety of CoA-SH is obtained by mildly heating (40 ◦ C) solutions of pantoyl lactone,
β-alanine and cysteamine [110]. These ﬁndings support the suggestion that organosulfur compounds
and thiols played important roles in prebiotic evolution [111].
Another approach to prebiotic chemistry, called “cyanosulﬁdic” chemical homologation, and
relying on hydrogen cyanide as the sole carbon and nitrogen source, H2 S as a reductant, and ultraviolet

47

MDPI Books

Life 2017, 7, 6

light and Cu(I)/Cu(II) catalysis of photo-redox cycling, can generate with high efﬁciency the building
blocks of protein, RNA, and lipids [112] (Figure 13).

Figure 13. Prebiotic syntheses of amino acid, ribonucelotide, and lipid precursors. Reproduced from
reference [113] with permission.

Reductive homologation of HCN (a) provides C2 and C3 sugar precursors of amino acids Gly, Ala,
Ser, and Thr, as well as of ribonucleotides. Reductive homologation of the products of glyceraldehyde
isomerization and reduction leads to lipid precursors, as well as amino acids Val and Leu (b). Cu(I)
catalyzed cross-coupling followed by reductive homologation gives precursors of Pro and Arg (c),
while Cu(II)-driven oxidative cross-coupling leads to precursors of Gln, Glu, Asn, and Asp (d) [112].
This simple approach inexorably leads to the very set of molecules used by modern biology.
Different components may be delivered at different times and places via pools and streams, rainfall,
and evaporite basins. Not only does this approach suggest that the set of proteinogenic amino
acids might be preordained for life, it also overcomes perceived incompatibilities between the key
subsystems and suggests that they could have developed together rather than sequentially [113].
9.2. The Thioester World

Sulfur is an important component of the present-day metabolic pathways. Several coenzymes,
including CoA-SH and pantetheine, and two of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids, methionine
and cysteine, contain sulfur. CoA-SH is thought to be a molecular fossil from an early metabolic
state [114], “a surviving representative of a group of thiol-amino acid-nucleotide compounds which contained
within their structures the potential for both peptide synthesis and nucleotide extension” and “a primitive
analogue of tRNA” [101]. Extant AARSs exhibit a vestigial ability to catalyze aminoacylation of
CoA-SH [64]. Both tRNA and CoA-SH, or its homologue pantetheine, can carry amino acids
for peptide bond synthesis [63]. A more recent ﬁnding points to a close metabolic relationship
between CoA-SH and RNA. For example, a chemical screen reveals a number of small molecule-RNA
conjugates, including 3 -dephospho-CoA-SH and its acetyl, succinyl, and methylmalonyl-thioester
derivatives [115]. These CoA species are attached at the 5 -terminus of small (<200 nucleotide) bacterial
RNA that have yet to be identiﬁed. There are ~100 CoA-RNA molecules per E. coli cell [115], which
suggests that these species are 10-fold less abundant than Phe-tRNAPhe [116].
Thioester chemistry underlies the participation of CoA-SH in acyl group activation in many
biological processes in the three kingdoms of life. As the thioester bond is crucial in biochemical
processes in extant organisms, then, by the principle of congruence, it must also have been important
in the origin of life [101,111]. It is thought that CoA-thioesters originated very early in the development
of life, dating back to the LUCA [117]. Particularly relevant in this context is the role of pantetheine,
a precursor of CoA-SH, in the activation of amino acids for non-coded peptide synthesis, which
48

MDPI Books

Life 2017, 7, 6

forms the basis for Lipmann’s proposal that the thioester-dependent mechanism of peptide bond
formation may have preceded the RNA-dependent mechanism of protein synthesis in the development
of life [118]. This proposal was taken further by De Duve who pointed out that peptides form
spontaneously from Aminoacyl Thioesters in aqueous solution [119] and suggested that Thioesters,
which would have provided proto-metabolism with catalysis and energy, were among early organic
molecules that seeded the development of life on the prebiotic Earth, i.e., in the Thioester World that
preceded the RNA World [111] (Scheme 3).
Since the original proposal [111], new ﬁndings providing strong support to the Thioester World
hypothesis have been generated [120]. Comparative genomic, structural, and biochemical studies
revealed that the present-day AARSs contain telltale traces pointing to a crucial role of sulfur and Thioesters
in the origin of amino acid activation and peptide bond synthesis. Hydrogen sulﬁde was a predominant
form of sulfur in the prebiotic world and, as shown by the spark discharge experiments in a simulated
prebiotic Earth environment (Figure 12), facilitated prebiotic formation of amino acids and a variety of
organosulfur compounds [103], including S-methyl-Cys, homocysteic acid, methionine, Met-sulfoxide,
Met-sulfone, ethionine (Eth), and cysteamine (CA) [107].

Scheme 3. Major stages in the evolution of life.

Because it forms easily by demethylation of methionine in the presence of iron or copper [121,122]
or under acidic conditions [41], Hcy must also have been present in prebiotic environments, as well
as the thioester Hcy-thiolactone, which forms easily from Hcy under acidic conditions [123]. Due to
its high chemical reactivity towards amine nucleophiles, Hcy-thiolactone could have participated
in the peptide bond formation [40]. Although amino acids can form under simulated hot volcanic
conditions in an alkaline aqueous Ni(OH)2 /KCN/CO system [124], organosulfur compounds such
as cysteine [105], homocysteic acid, cysteamine, and methionine are produced more readily from
H2 S-containing primitive atmospheres [107]. Pantetheine, a precursor to CoA-SH, is also formed under
simulated prebiotic conditions [110].
Thioesters form easily under acidic conditions [41] and can spontaneously react with amino acids
to form peptides [119]. The thioester bond [125] is a high-energy bond and thus is highly reactive
towards amino groups [39,41]. Peptides can also form in other plausible prebiotic environments
containing carbon monoxide, H2 S or CH3 SH on (Fe,Ni)S or pyrite FeS2 surfaces [126], or by using a
plausible prebiotic condensing agent cyanamide [127]. However, peptide synthesis from thioesters is
much more robust [119,128] than from pyrite/methyl sulﬁde- or cyanamide-dependent reactions.
The thioester chemistry of extant Class I and Class II AARSs (Table 4), and structural/ functional
similarities of their catalytic domains to enzymes participating in CoA-SH and sulfur metabolism point

49

MDPI Books

Life 2017, 7, 6

to the origin of the amino acid activation and peptide bond synthesis functions in the Thioester World
(Scheme 3). These ﬁndings strongly suggest that before the development of coded protein synthesis, catalytic
domains of ancestral AARSs may have facilitated the formation of aminoacyl thioestersupported non-coded
peptide synthesis. With Cys and Hcy as thiol substrates, AARSs support the synthesis of AA-Cys and
AA-Hcy dipeptides. With Cys-Gly as a thiol substrate tripeptide AA-Cys-Gly forms in reactions
catalyzed by AARSs.
Peptides containing N-terminal Cys can be extended to longer peptides by condensing with
aminoacyl-thioesters in reactions analogous to native chemical ligation exploited in chemical synthesis
of proteins [128]. Hcy-(AA)n peptides are easily formed in reactions of Hcy~thiolactone with
amino acids or dipeptides [39]. The α/β/α-layered and antiparallel β-sheet structures that gave
rise to catalytic domains of primordial Class I and Class II AARSs, respectively, may have been
assembled from short peptide hairpins [35,37] formed in non-coded thioester-dependent peptide
synthesis. Cys-containing peptides must have played an important role in peptide -> protein evolution:
Cys residues endow extant proteins with the ability to modify their structure by splicing out speciﬁc
peptides [129].
With the advent of RNA, which may have been synthesized in catalytic pockets of ancestral
AARSs [35] (as suggested by the ability of extant AARSs to catalyze the formation of AppppA and
related dinucleoside oligophosphates [4,5]), the function of thiols (CoA-SH, panthethiene) in the
non-coded peptide synthesis was expanded to RNA minihelices [64,130]. Before the emergence of the
Genetic Code, ancestral AARSs could have facilitated formation of aminoacyl-S-CoA/panthetheine
thioesters and aminoacyl-RNA esters for non-coded peptide assembly [63]. The thioester-dependent
and RNA-dependent peptide synthesizing systems could have been developing in parallel, possibly
via interrelated stages. Vestiges of this stage of prebiotic evolution, i.e., CoA-SH-dependent and
RNA-dependent peptide synthesizing activities, are still visible in catalytic domains of extant
AARSs [63,64] and the CDPs [82], respectively. The traces of the transition from the Thioester World to
RNA World can also be found in the GNAT fold superfamily, which can use acyl~S-CoA thioesters or
aminoacyl~tRNA esters as substrates for amide or peptide bond synthesis.
10. Conclusions

Coded peptide synthesis has been preceded by a prebiotic stage, a Thioester World, in which
thioesters played key roles.
Remnants of the Thioester World can be found in extant aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARSs)
and related proteins:
A thiol-binding site at the catalytic domain of AARSs confers the amino acid:thiol ligase activity;
AARSs are structurally related to proteins involved in sulfur/CoA-SH metabolism and peptide
bond synthesis;
Protein folds that bind pantetheine/CoA-SH can also bind tRNA.

Abstract: In this work, we determine the biological and mathematical properties that are sufﬁcient
and necessary to uniquely determine both the primeval RNY (purine-any base-pyrimidine) code
and the standard genetic code (SGC). These properties are: the evolution of the SGC from the RNY
code; the degeneracy of both codes, and the non-degeneracy of the assignments of aminoacyl-tRNA
synthetases (aaRSs) to amino acids; the wobbling property; the consideration that glycine was the
ﬁrst amino acid; the topological and symmetrical properties of both codes.

Keywords: RNY code; Standard genetic code; evolution of the genetic code; frozen code; degeneracy;
aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases; symmetry

1. Introduction

A fundamental feature of all life forms existing on Earth is that, with several minor exceptions,
they share the same standard genetic code (SGC). This universality led Francis Crick to propose the
frozen accident hypothesis [1], i.e., the SGC does not change. According to Crick [1], the SGC code
remained universal because any change would be lethal, or would have been very strongly selected
against and extinguished.
The astonishing diversity of living beings in the history of the biosphere has not been halted by a
frozen SGC. The inherent structure of the frozen SGC, in concert with environmental inﬂuences, has
unleashed life from determinism.
It is widely accepted that there was an age in the origin of life in which RNA played the role of
both genetic material and the main agent of catalytic activity [1–3]. This period is known as the RNA
World [4,5].
The reign of the RNA World on Earth probably began no more than about 4.2 billion years ago,
and ended no less than about 3.6 billion years ago [6]. Eigen and coworkers (1968) [7] revealed kinship
relations by alignments of tRNA sequences and they concluded that the genetic code is not older than
but almost as old as our planet. There is an enormous leap from the RNA World to the complexity of
DNA replication, protein manufacture and biochemical pathways. Code stability since its formation
on the early Earth has contributed to preserving evidence of the transition from an RNA World to a
protein-dependent world.
The transfer RNA (tRNA) is perhaps the most important molecule in the origin and evolution of
the genetic code. Just two years after the discovery of the double-helix structure of DNA, Crick [8,9]
proposed the existence of small adaptor RNA molecules that would act as decoders carrying their
own amino acids and interacting with the messenger RNA (mRNA) template in a position for
polymerization to take place.
The SGC is written in an alphabet of four letters (C, A, U, G), grouped into words three letters
long, called triplets or codons. Crick represented the genetic code in a two-dimensional table arranged
in such a way that it is possible to readily ﬁnd any amino acid from the three letters, written in the 5

to 3 direction of the codon [1]. Each of the 64 codons speciﬁes one of the 20 amino acids or else serves
as a punctuation mark signaling the end of a message.
Crick proposed the wobble hypothesis [10,11], which accounts for the degeneracy of the SGC:
the third position in each codon is said to wobble because it is much less speciﬁc than the ﬁrst and
second positions.
Given 64 codons and 20 amino acids plus a punctuation mark, there are 2164 ≈ 4 × 1084 possible
genetic codes. This staggering number is beyond any imaginable astronomical number, the total count
of electrons in the universe being well below this number. Note, however, that this calculation tacitly
ignores the evolution of the SGC. If we assume two sets of 32 complementary triplets where each set
codes for 10 amino acids, we would have 1032 × 1032 = 1064 possible codes. Then we have a reduction
of the order of 4 × 1020 . Albeit this is a signiﬁcant reduction, it is still a very large number. Many more
biological constraints are necessary. The result that only one in every million random alternative codes
is more efﬁcient than the SGC [12] implies that there could be ∼ 4 × 1078 genetic codes as efﬁcient as
the SGC. This calculation does not offer deeper insights concerning the origin and structure of the
SGC, particularly the frozen accident.
Crick [1] argued that the SGC need not be special at all; it could be nothing more than a “frozen
accident”. This concept is not far away from the idea that there was an age of miracles. However, as
we show in this article, there are indeed several features that are special about the SGC: ﬁrst, it can be
partitioned into two classes of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) [13]; secondly, the SGC can be
broken down into a product of simpler groups reﬂecting the pattern of degeneracy observed [14,15];
third, it has symmetrical properties, and evolution did not erase its own evolutionary footsteps [16].
Several models on the origin of the genetic code from prebiotic constituents have been
proposed [17–21]. Among the 20 canonical amino acids of the biological coding system, the amino
acid glycine is one of the most abundant in prebiotic experiments that simulate the conditions of
the primitive planet, either by electrical discharges or simulations of volcanic activity [22–24], and
this amino acid is also abundant in the analysis of meteorites [25]. Bernhardt and Patrick (2014), and
Tamura (2015) [26,27] also suggested that glycine was the ﬁrst amino acid incorporated into the genetic
code according to an internal analysis of its corresponding tRNA and its crucial importance in the
structure and function of proteins. Part of this abundance can be ascribed to its structural simplicity
when compared with the structure of the remaining 19 canonical amino acids. Several models for the
origin of the coding system mirror glycine as one of the initial amino acids in this system [26–29].
The SGC was theoretically derived from a primeval RNY (R means purine, Y pyrimidine, and N
any of them) genetic code under a model of sequential symmetry breakings [14,15], and vestiges of
this primeval RNY genetic code were found in current genomes of both Eubacteria and Archaea [16].
All distance series of codons showed critical-scale invariance not only in RNY sequences (all ORFs
(Open reading frames) concatenated after discarding the non-RNY triplets), but also in all codons
of two intermediate steps of the genetic code and in all kind of codons in the current genomes [16].
Such scale invariance has been preserved for at least 3.5 billion years, beginning with an RNY genetic
code to the SGC throughout two evolutionary pathways. These two likely evolutionary paths of the
genetic code were also analyzed algebraically and can be clearly visualized in three, four and six
dimensions [15,30,31].
The RNY subcode is widely considered as the primeval genetic code [32]. It comprises 16 triplets
and eight amino acids, where each amino acid is encoded by two codons. The abiotic support of the
RNY primeval code is in agreement with observations on abundant amino acids in Miller’s sets [33]
and in the chronology of the appearance of amino acids according to Trifonov’s review [34]. It has been
shown that once the primeval genetic code reached the RNY code, the elimination of any amino acid
at this stage would be strongly selected against and therefore the genetic code was already frozen [35].
There are 20 aaRSs which are divided into two 10-member, non-overlapping classes, I and II, and
they provide virtually errorless aminoacylation of tRNAs [36,37]. Therefore, this operational code is
non- degenerate [36,37].

In this work, we pose the following question: What are the minimum necessary and sufﬁcient
biological and mathematical properties to uniquely determine the primeval RNY code and the SGC?
2. Mathematical Model of the RNY Code

The RNY code consists of codons where the ﬁrst base is a purine (R), the third is a pyrimidine (Y)
and the second is any of them (Table 1). In this code, the wobble position is strictly present on the third
base of the triplet. The number of possible RNY codes is 816 = 2.81 × 1014 .

The SGC has been represented in a six-dimensional hypercube [30,38]. Observing that 64 is equal
not only to 43 but also to 26 , the codon table can be organized as a six-dimensional hypercube [30].
In such a model, the set of codons are treated as the 64 vertices of the hypercube, and they are joined
by edges which connect codons that differ by a single nucleotide. Each dimension describes a type
of mutation, transition or transversion acting on each of three bases of any codon. Consequently, we
obtain the six dimensions.
This symmetrical model [38] can be partitioned exactly into two classes of aaRSs in six dimensions;
it displays symmetry groups when the polar requirement is used, and the SGC can be broken down
into a product of simpler groups reﬂecting the pattern of degeneracy observed, and the salient fact that
evolution did not erase its own evolutionary footsteps. The symmetrical model and the Rodin-Ohno
model [13] are one and the same [38].
Similarly, the RNY subcode can be represented in a four-dimensional hypercube (Figure 1).
This hypercube will be employed to reduce the possible number of mappings, by considering its
topology and neighborhood properties. Codons that codify the same amino acid are neighbors.
Note from Figure 1 that codons for the same amino acid are next to each other, due to the fact that they
differ in only the third base and therefore they are at distance of one. A detailed description of the
6D hypercube representing the SGC can be found in Reference [30].

are in red and those for class II are in black.

3. Combinatorics of the RNY Code

MDPI Books

Life 2017, 7, 7

We have noted above that the number of possible codes composed by eight amino acids and
16 triplets is 816 = 2.81 × 1014 . This number includes codes completely redundant (all codons assigned
to the same amino acid) or codes in which all amino acids share the same degeneration, as in the
present RNY code. Also, there may not be restrictions between the two classes of aaRS and their
corresponding amino acids. First, we consider the restriction in which all amino acids are coded by two
triplets, and such codes are given by the multinomial coefﬁcient (2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2)! = 16!
 8.17 × 1010 .
2!8
The present RNY code arranges the triplets so that two codonsfor the
same
amino
acid
are
neighbors in

4
the four-dimensional cube. With such a restriction, there are
8! = 161, 280 possible RNY codes,
1
since there are four possible conﬁgurations in which amino acids can be arranged in the 4-dimensional
hypercube hypercube. This neighborhood property preserves the degeneracy irrrespective of the
particular wobbling nucleotide, not necessarily the third position. The number 8! accounts for the fact
that all the permutations in the assignation of amino acids maintain the property that the two codons
that encode the same amino acid must be neighbors.
Considering the third base as the source of variability in the code, the number of posibilities
is reduced to 8! = 40, 320. If we consider only the ﬁrst two bases that determine the amino acid, it
is possible to reduce the four-dimensional cube to a three-dimensional cube in which the vertices
represent the ﬁrst two nucleotides (Figure 2a). If the vertices are relabeled to show the codiﬁed amino
acid, we obtain a phenotypic cube (Figure 2b).

Figure 2. (a) Cube of RNY dinucleotides according to the four-dimensional model of the code.
Dinucleotides for class I amino acids are in red; and those for class II are in black; (b) Phenotypic cube
of amino acids according to the four-dimensional model of the RNY code. Class I amino acids are in
red and those of class II are in black.

If we consider that there are two amino
 acids that belong to class I and six amino acids that
8
correspond to class II, then there are 2
6! = 37, 440 possible codes. This calculation comes from
2
taking two out of the eight amino acids and assigning them to class I, considering its permutations
and also the permutations of the amino acids of class II. To maintain the topological properties of the
RNY model, four triplets of class I must form a square in the four-dimensional model, or similarly, the
dinucleotides must be neighbors, i.e., they are connected by an edge in the cube representation. In this
case, there are 2(12)6! = 17, 280 different codes that preserve the aaRSs distribution in the code and in
the model. This number arises from the 12 edges available in the cube to join classs I amino acids and
the permutations of classs II amino acids.
In order to maintain the topological properties of the three-dimensional cube, the amino acids of
a code must share the neighboring properties of the current RNY code. In other words, if two amino
acids are next to each other in the current model, then they are also adjacent in a model constructed by

60

MDPI Books

such a code. This property is manifested by the fact that such codes are built by the symmetries of the
present model, so that there are 48 different codes that keep the topology of the current code intact.
The ocurrence of glycine as the ﬁrst amino acid and its assignment to the triplets GGC and GGU
as a ﬁxed starting point in the evolution of the SGC impose another restriction, particularly when
contrasted with the topology of the four- and three-dimensional cubes, since it ﬁxates isoleucine
to AUC


3
and AUU in order to keep the adjacency properties. In this case, there are as many as
2=6
1
possible codes, due to the fact that there are three possible positions for valine that maintain its
adjacency to isoleucine, and there are two symmetrical conﬁgurations (given by a reﬂection) that
maintain the rest of the topology.
In the actual code, all triplets where the middle base is uracile codify for amino acids of class I,
and this pattern forces the triplets of valine to be GUC and GUU, which in turn also ﬁxes AGC and
AGU for serine. This results in two possible RNY codes, which here and further on will be denoted by
RNY and ∅RNY. The RNY denotes the actual and original RNY code, whereas ∅RNY represents
an alternative code in which the codons for threonine and alanine are simultaneously interchanged
with the ones of aspartic acid and asparagine, respectively. The ﬁxation of another amino acid would
completely constraint the number of RNY possible codes to only one!
4. Evolution of the RNY Code by Means of Frame-Shifts and Transversions

Two genetic codes from which the primeval RNA code could have originated the SGC were
derived [14–16]. The primeval RNA code consists of 16 codons that specify eight amino acids (then this
code shows a slight degeneration). The extended RNA code type I consists of all codons of the RNY
type plus codons obtained by considering the RNA code, but in the second (NYR-type) and third
(YRN-type) reading frames. The extended RNA code type II comprises all codons of the RNY type
plus codons that arise from transversions of the RNA code in the ﬁrst (YNY type) and third (RNR)
nucleotide bases. Then, by allowing frame-reading mistranslations, we arrived at 48 codons that
specify 17 amino acids and the three stop codons. If transversions in the ﬁrst or third nucleotide bases
of the RNY pattern are permitted, then there are also 48 codons that encode for 18 amino acids but no
stop codons.
In the context of the frozen concept, it was concluded that considering the symmetries of both
extended RNA codes, the primeval RNY code was already frozen and it evolved like a replicating and
growing icicle [14]. The composition of both extended codes eventually leads to the actual SGC.
As the RNY is described mathematically as a four-dimensional cube, each extended code
comprises a duplication of the RNY cube in order to determine a ﬁve-dimensional prism as an
intermediate step towards the ﬁnal six-dimensional cube for the SGC. Supposing one of the two
alternative RNY codes as the initial code, the number of possible extended codes can be calculated.
Then, assuming, as before, that wobbling occurs principally at the third base, the current degeneration
of the code and the topology given by the mathematical model shall be maintained.
If the RNY is used as a cornerstone for the formation of the genetic code, then, regardless of the
evolutionary path chosen, there are two SGCs which are compatible with all the assumptions. These are
the actual SGC and a second one in which the codiﬁcations of AUG and UGG are interchanged with
the ones of AUA and UGA, respectively. These modiﬁcations make it so that methionine is codiﬁed by
AUA and tryptophane by UGA, while AUG codes for isoleucine and UGG is a stop signal. The rest of
the code remains unaltered.
On the other hand, if ∅RNY is used as an initial condition, then there are no possible codes on
any evolutionary path which meet all hypotheses. In other words, it is not possible to derive the SGC
from ∅RNY without violating at least one of the considered properties. This is due to the fact that the
mathematical model forbids the possible extended codes that would keep biological properties such as
wobbling and the binary division of aaRSs.

5. Discussion

MDPI Books

Life 2017, 7, 7

It is possible to gradually add properties to the RNY code to reduce the number of possible
codes from 2.81 × 104 to only one. This is done when considering the current properties of
degeneracy of the RNY code and the wobble, the aaRSs distribution in the RNY and in the SGC,
and ﬁnally the mathematical model to represent the genetic code and its induced property of adjacency.
The mathematical model plays an important role in the reduction of the possible number of codes.
The 37, 440 possible RNY codes were obtained by considering the degeneration in the third base
and by assuming that the distribution of aaRRs classes is the same as in the current RNY code.
Further reductions, up to one code, were only accomplished by the use of our mathematical model.
Both evolutionary paths majorly reduce the number of possible genetic codes from the staggering
number of 4.18 × 1084 to only two, which consists of the current code and an alternative code with a
subtle modiﬁcation. The alternative RNY code, ∅RNY, cannot lead to an SGC that is compatible with
all the hypotheses by means of the transversions and frame-shift reading mistranslations. Hence, the
SGC evolved from the RNY code.
Novozhilov et al. [39] found that the SGC is a suboptimal random code in regard to robustness to
error of translations. Thus, the SGC appears to be a point on an evolutionary trajectory from a random
code about halfway to the summit (or to the valley) of the local peak in a rugged ﬁtness landscape.
So far, all we know is terrestrial biology. If life is to be found somewhere else in the universe, and
even if its ancestry can be traced back to primitive organisms, the rules of the assignments of codons to
amino acids may not necessarily be the same and the amino acids may be even chemically different
to those found in known terrestrial life. Different environments and different evolutionary paths on
different worlds could result in completely different genetic codes and patterns of evolution.
In conclusion, the SGC is certainly ubiquitous in Earth, and what we would expect to ﬁnd in
living beings on other planets is, precisely, this universal biological property: a genetic coding system.

Abstract: The tRNA identity elements for some amino acids are distinct between the bacterial and
archaeal domains. Searching in recent genomic and metagenomic sequence data, we found some
candidate phyla radiation (CPR) bacteria with archaeal tRNA identity for Tyr-tRNA and Trp-tRNA
synthesis. These bacteria possess genes for tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS) and tryptophanyl-tRNA
synthetase (TrpRS) predicted to be derived from DPANN superphylum archaea, while the cognate
tRNATyr and tRNATrp genes reveal bacterial or archaeal origins. We identiﬁed a trace of domain
fusion and swapping in the archaeal-type TyrRS gene of a bacterial lineage, suggesting that CPR
bacteria may have used this mechanism to create diverse proteins. Archaeal-type TrpRS of bacteria
and a few TrpRS species of DPANN archaea represent a new phylogenetic clade (named TrpRS-A).
The TrpRS-A open reading frames (ORFs) are always associated with another ORF (named ORF1)
encoding an unknown protein without global sequence identity to any known protein. However,
our protein structure prediction identiﬁed a putative HIGH-motif and KMSKS-motif as well as many
α-helices that are characteristic of class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) homologs. These results
provide another example of the diversity of molecular components that implement the genetic code
and provide a clue to the early evolution of life and the genetic code.
Keywords: tRNA; aaRS; genetic code; evolution; lateral gene transfer

1. Introduction

Bacteria, archaea and eukarya share the standard genetic code, which suggests that they share a
universal common ancestor (LUCA). However, the molecular systems underlying the standard genetic
code are not completely conserved between all domains of life. In aminoacyl-tRNA synthesis, several
elements of tRNA such as the anticodon sequence, other nucleotide residues, post-transcriptional
modiﬁcations, and local and global tertiary structures are recognized by the cognate aminoacyl-tRNA
synthetase (aaRS) [1–3]. While it is known that in all domains of life the anticodon sequences of tRNATyr
and tRNATrp are recognized by their cognate aaRSs, the other major identity elements of tRNATyr and
tRNATrp are distinct between the bacterial domain and the archaeal and eukaryotic domains [1,2,4,5]
(Figure 1A). In bacteria, tRNATyr contains a G1-C72 base pair and a variable arm (V-arm) that is
recognized by the additional C-terminal S4-like domain of bacteria-type TyrRS (Figure 1A,B) [6].
On the other hand, archaea and eukaryotes encode a tRNATyr lacking the V-arm and containing a
C1-G72 base pair (Figure 1A) [6]. For tRNATrp , bacteria encode a tRNATrp with G73, whereas archaea
and eukaryotes have a tRNATrp with A73 and a G1-C72 base pair (Figure 1A) [7]. Thus, unlike the
other aaRS species, archaeal and eukaryotic TyrRS and TrpRS have not been found in the bacterial
domain [6,8–15].

Diverse subgroups of the Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR) have archaea-like tRNATyr and tRNATrp
genes, as shown below the tRNA structures. Ca. Beckwithbacteria bacterium RBG_13_42_9 has both

is known to form a homodimer (in a few cases pseudo-homodimer) and binds to one tRNA molecule
at a time (half-of-the-sites). Bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic origins are indicated with b, a and e,
respectively; (C) Phylogenetic analysis of the class Ic aaRS family. Maximum likelihood bootstrap
values (100 replicates) are shown. The TrpRS-A species are split into two clades. The TrpRS-A2 proteins
may chelate a [4Fe–4S] cluster.

A fundamental question in understanding the evolution of the genetic code is whether tRNA
identities were established at the time of LUCA, and if so, which tRNA identity set was used [13,16].
The discovery of bacteria with an archaeal tRNA identity would provide support for the hypothesis
that archaeal tRNA identity sets may have been used in LUCA. A clue to the answer to this question
was provided by two synthetic biology studies [17,18]. The artiﬁcial gene transfer of an archaeal or
eukaryotic TyrRS or TrpRS gene to Escherichia coli was successfully achieved by the simultaneous
66

MDPI Books

Life 2017, 7, 8

transfer of an archaeal or eukaryotic tRNA gene [17,18]. These heterologous aaRS•tRNA pairs
functionally replaced the endogenous aaRS•tRNA pairs in E. coli. Thus, it can be hypothesized
that the archaeal tRNATyr and tRNATrp identities might have been used in LUCA.
Inspired by these studies, we carefully re-investigated the phylogenetic distribution of TyrRS and
TrpRS. In the present study, archaea-, eukarya-, and bacteria-type is used to indicate the canonical
archaea-, eukarya-, or bacteria-type aaRS, respectively, independent of the organism in which the
enzyme is identiﬁed. Surprisingly, we found a putative bacterial species annotated to have a
eukarya-type TyrRS gene (EKE14628.1) [19]. This Ca. Roizmanbacteria bacterium belongs to the
candidate phyla radiation (CPR) composed of diverse uncultured bacteria which are often symbiotic
with DPANN archaea [20–24]. Although composite genomes of CPR bacteria and DPANN archaea
are sometimes contaminated by DPANN archaeal genomes and CPR bacterial genomes, respectively,
a recent study was able to identify archaea-like form II/III RubisCO genes in CPR bacteria [25].
These ﬁndings prompted us to search for archaea/eukarya-type Tyr- and Trp-encoding systems
in bacteria.
2. Materials and Methods
Bioinformatics

Archaeal and eukaryotic TyrRS genes and non-canonical bacteria-type TyrRS genes were collected
in three steps. First, TyrRS genes of representative archaea and eukaryotes were collected by a
keyword search (tyrosyl/tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase; tyrosine/tryptophan–tRNA ligase) and
a BLASTp search in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. Next,
archaea/eukarya-type TyrRS genes in the bacterial domain were collected by a BLASTp search in
the NCBI database and manually curated. Lastly, TyrRS amino acid sequences which showed about
≥40% similarity with a query sequence (GenBank: KKM02188.1) were collected from all genome,
metagenome and metatranscriptome protein sequence datasets in the Integrated Microbial Genomes
(IMG) system [26] (last update September 2016). The reason for employing KKM02188.1 was to ﬁnd
bacteria whose TyrRSs resemble opisthokontal (fungal and animal) TyrRSs. The query protein belongs
to an unknown fungus in a marine sediment metagenome and shows good similarity (41%–51%) to
both opisthokontal and Daviesbacteria GW2011_GWA1_38_7 TyrRS species.
Non-canonical TrpRS genes in the bacterial domain were ﬁrst identiﬁed by a BLASTp search
in the NCBI database using the Pyrococcus horikoshii TrpRS (UniProtKB: O59584.2) as query.
Non-canonical TrpRS genes which showed >40% amino acid similarity with Ca. Beckwithbacteria
bacterium RBG_13_42_9 TrpRS-A were collected by BLASTp searches in the NCBI database and
IMG’s groundwater metagenome datasets. The obtained protein sequences were analyzed by
Clustal X 2.1 [27] (for rough alignment), SeaView ver 4.0 [28] (for manual curation), MEGA7 [29] with
the default settings (Maximum Likelihood, JTT model, Uniform rates, Use all Gaps/Missing sites, for
phylogeny estimation), and BoxShade Server ver. 3.21 (for visualization). Multiple sequence alignment
analyses by Clustal X were followed by a manual curation based on the reported structure-based
alignments of TyrRS and TrpRS [30–35]. For the phylogenetic analyses of class Ic aaRSs, N- and
C-terminal protein sequences were trimmed and nonconserved insertion sequences removed; up
to 13 residues upstream of the HIGH motif and to the end of the anticodon binding domain were
included in the analyses. Protein two- and three-dimentional structural prediction was performed using
JPred 4 [36] and SWISS-MODEL [37], respectively. tRNATyr and tRNATrp sequences were identiﬁed by
a BLASTn search using automatically annotated tRNATyr and tRNATrp sequences as queries.

Life 2017, 7, 8

We found tRNATyr with C1-G72 and archaea/eukarya-type TyrRS genes in diverse subgroups of
the Parcubacteria (OD1), Microgenomates (OP11), Dojkabacteria (WS6) and Katanobacteria (WWE3)
phyla in CPR [22,25] (Figure 1A). In many cases, the CPR tRNATyr species with C1-G72 contain
a V-arm, indicating that these non-canonical tRNATyr species are derived from bacterial tRNATyr
with a V-arm. Both a V-arm-containing and a V-arm-lacking tRNATyr with C1-G72 are found in
Ca. Roizmanbacteria bacterium GW2011_GWC2_34_23. On the other hand, tRNATrp with A73 and
archaea/eukarya-type TrpRS genes are found in a few Microgenomates bacteria (Figure 1A). Both
a bacterial tRNATrp with G73 and a tRNATrp with A73 exist in Ca. Bechwithbacteria bacterium
RBG_13_42_9. We named these non-canonical TrpRS species as TrpRS-A (Figure 1B). Interestingly,
TrpRS-A is slightly different from the canonical archaeal TrpRS species, but highly similar to minor
DPANN archaeal TrpRS species (also named TrpRS-A) found only in the groundwater metagenomes
(Figure 1C). We identiﬁed only 12 instances of TrpRS-A genes in total, suggesting an infrequent
distribution of these genes in nature. These bacterial and archaeal TrpRS-A species form a terminal
clade within the archaeal/eukaryotic TrpRS clade and can be grouped into two sub-clades (TrpRS-A1
and TrpRS-A2) (Figure 1C). The TrpRS-A1 proteins appear to be restricted within CPR bacteria.
The TrpRS-A2 proteins are predicted to chelate a [4Fe–4S] cluster through their four cysteine residues,
like some bacterial and archaeal TrpRS proteins having a C-x22-C-x6-C-x2-C motif [38].
3.2. Archaea/Eukarya-Type TyrRS in the Bacterial Domain

We then investigated the collected TyrRS sequences. A high-resolution phylogeny for archaea/
eukarya-type TyrRS suggests that several lineages of CPR bacteria independently obtained an
archaea/eukarya-type TyrRS gene from archaea (Figure 2). Alternatively, lateral gene transfer
(LGT) might have occurred from bacteria to archaea and other groups of bacteria. Interestingly, one
bacterial TyrRS sequence (3300007427.a:Ga0100483_102719) is highly similar to the TyrRS sequences
of Acanthamoeba castellanii and Pandoraviruses (the Eukarya domain) (see the Ultra-High resolution
region in Figure 2). Thus, LGT between bacteria and amoeba or giant viruses can be reasonably
assumed. This Pandoravirus-like TyrRS, as well as two other TyrRSs derived from WS6 bacterium
GW2011 GWA2_37_6 [24,39] and an active sludge metagenome, possess a B2 domain of bacterial
phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase β-subunit (PheRSβ) [40]. This domain is fused to the N-terminus
of the TyrRS by a long α-helix (Figure 3A). The B2 domain belongs to the RNA-binding OB folds,
but it is missing in many CPR-bacterial PheRSβ (for example, OGE14653.1). We also found that
a few Microgenomates lysyl-tRNA synthetases (KKR67068.1 & KKQ91124.1) have an additional
C-terminal domain that is very similar to this B2 domain and predicted α-helix. It is known that aaRS
proteins are often fused with an OB domain [41]. The two Klosterneuburg active sludge metagenomic
contigs containing the B2-TyrRS fusion genes showed almost identical gene organization and gene
sequences, indicating that these two contigs belong to two closely-related bacteria. However, only the
TyrRS ‘domain’ sequences are different in terms of sequence similarity (Figure 3A,B). While one is
Pandoravirus-like, as previously mentioned, the other is most similar to the TyrRS ‘domain’ sequence
of the B2-TyrRS species of WS6 bacterium GW2011 GWA2_37_6 (Figures 2 and 3A). A possible
explanation for this is that the TyrRS ‘domain’ sequence was replaced with the Pandoravirus-like
sequence in a bacterial lineage (Figure 3B, the upper contig). This ﬁnding will help us understand
aaRS evolution through domain fusion and swapping.

superphylum according to the Joint Genome Institute’s annotation pipeline and our manual annotation.
The opisthokontal (fungal and animal) TyrRS clade is marked with a green box. We chose a few
representative TyrRS sequences for each major bacterial group (Roizmanbacteria, Daviesbacteria,
Shapirobacteria, Wolfebacteria and Andersenbacteria) after conﬁrming the sequence similarity within
the same group. In contrast, we identiﬁed three orphan TyrRS genes belonging to bacteria in the
Ultra-High resolution region. TrpRS sequences of Thermus thermophilus (bacteria) and Pyrococcus
horikoshii (archaea) were used as an outgroup.

3.3. Non-Canonical TrpRS Species and Their Associating Proteins

We then investigated the genetic loci of the TrpRS-A genes (Figure 4A). In bacteria, tRNATrp
(A73) and TrpRS-A comprise an operon. Interestingly, this operon is either followed by a bacteria-type
TrpRS gene or headed by a trp repressor gene (Figure 4A). This is consistent with Ca. Beckwithbacteria
bacterium RBG_13_42_9 possessing a bacterial tRNATrp (G73) somewhere else in the genome.
The observed operon structures indicate that the tRNATrp (A73) and TrpRS-A1 genes may be regulated
by tryptophan availability and could coexist with a canonical bacterial TrpRS•tRNATrp pair. In archaea,
one or two tRNATrp (A73) genes, one or two TrpRS-A2 genes and another gene encoding a TrpRS-A
homolog (named TrpRS-A-like) are found in addition to a single canonical archaeal TrpRS gene.
TrpRS-A-like has several insertions and deletions compared to archaea/eukarya-type TrpRS and
TrpRS-A. Thus, TrpRS-A and TrpRS-A-like coexist with a canonical archaeal TrpRS in archaea.

Interestingly, TrpRS-A2 and TrpRS-A-like genes are also found in putative bacterial metagenomic
contigs (Figure 4A), implying multiple LGT events.

TrpRS-A-like genes. Bootstrap values (%) are shown for the unrooted Maximum Likelihood tree made
with 100 replicates using MEGA7.

We found an unusual open reading frame (named as ORF1) between the tRNATrp (A73) and
TrpRS-A1 genes in the bacterial operons and in the gene clusters of the TrpRS-A2 and TrpRS-A-like
in archaea (Figure 4A). The ORF1 is completely conserved and appears to have co-evolved with
the TrpRS-A1, TrpRS-A2 and TrpRS-A-like ORFs (Figure 4B). ORF1 sequences show no signiﬁcant
similarity with any known protein (less than score 40 in NCBI BLASTp searches). However, the
predicted structure of the ORF1 proteins includes HIGH-motif-like and KMSKS-motif-like motifs [2],
as well as many α-helices, thereby suggesting that these proteins might be structural homologs
of class I aaRSs (Figure 5). Seventy residues from the putative HIGH motif of ORF1 matched the
corresponding region of cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase (a class Ia aaRS) with 16.9% sequence identity

in our SWISS-MODEL prediction. However, in the ORF1 structure prediction, the Rossmann-fold
domain is missing [42], indicating a function distinct from class I aaRS or class I aaRS homolog that
synthesizes cyclo(L-Trp-L-Trp) using tryptophanyl-tRNATrp [43]. Interestingly, both TrpRS-A1 and
ORF1 pairs and bacteria-type TrpRSs of these bacteria lack any tryptophan residues (see Figure 5
for the ORF1 cases). This might imply that tryptophan may be limited for these bacteria living in
groundwater environments.

Life 2017, 7, 8

It was thought that LGT of some archaeal/eukaryotic aaRS genes to bacteria would be prevented
by the difference in tRNA identity rules. A previous bioinformatic study detected a case of
eukaryotic-like histidine (His) tRNA identity (i.e., A73) in certain α-proteobacteria [12]. These
α-proteobacterial tRNAHis species have A73 and lack G-1 [44]. However, a subsequent biochemical
study revealed A73 to be a minor identity element of the Caulobacter crescentus histidyl-tRNA synthetase
(HisRS) [45]. A recent comprehensive bioinformatic study did not support any LGT event of HisRS
from eukaryotes to α-proteobacteria [8], suggesting that the eukaryotic-like tRNAHis identity in
certain α-proteobacteria might be a result of convergent evolution. Similarly, it is known that some
mitochondrial aaRSs violate the bacterial identity rules. For example, human mitochondrial TyrRS
charges mitochondrial tRNATyr species with G1-C72 (wild-type) or C1-G72 (mutant) with the same
efﬁciency [46]. The V-arm is missing in the human mitochondrial tRNATyr , whereas the human
mitochondrial TyrRS retains the S4-like domain [47].
In contrast to these previous ﬁndings, our results provide the ﬁrst evidence that archaeal or
eukaryotic TyrRS and TrpRS genes exist in a few lineages of bacteria that have tRNATyr or tRNATrp
species with archaeal and eukaryotic identity elements. Intimate relationships between CPR bacteria
and DPANN archaea may have facilitated LGT of TyrRS and TrpRS genes. Furthermore, our
high-resolution TyrRS phylogeny and another comprehensive study [8] revealed that the LGT of
TyrRS may have occurred several times among DPANN archaea, CPR bacteria, eukaryotes and giant
viruses (Figure 2). Taken together, our data make clear that tRNA identities may not be hardwired to
each domain of life.
The functions of TrpRS-A, TrpRS-A-like and the ORF1 proteins remain unclear. Their operon
structures suggest that they are involved in tryptophan metabolism and encoding, rather than
producing complex antibiotics, plant toxins and peptidoglycans [43,48]. Since TrpRS-A and
TrpRS-A-like genes appear to occur in addition to the canonical TrpRS gene in both bacteria and
archaea, TrpRS-A and TrpRS-A-like genes might encode additional copies of TrpRS that display a
higher or lower speciﬁcity for tryptophan than the canonical TrpRS in order to confer antibiotic
resistance [49] or to cope with stress [50]. The ORF1 proteins might bind to the homodimers of TrpRS-A
and TrpRS-A-like in order to be stabilized in a complex [51]. Another possibility is that TrpRS-A
and TrpRS-A-like proteins might form heterodimers with the partner ORF1 protein. It is known
that some eukaryotes have a double-length TyrRS species forming a pseudo-dimer in which one of
the “subunits” is catalytic but has lost the afﬁnity for the tRNATyr anticodon, whereas the other is
non-catalytic but still recognizes the anticodon [52]. In addition, trans-oligomerization of duplicated
threonyl-tRNA synthetases is known [50]. Future studies should elucidate the biochemical properties
and the biological functions of these proteins.

Abstract: The methods for establishing synthetic lifeforms with rewritten genetic codes comprising
non-canonical amino acids (NCAA) in addition to canonical amino acids (CAA) include
proteome-wide replacement of CAA, insertion through suppression of nonsense codon, and insertion
via the pyrrolysine and selenocysteine pathways. Proteome-wide reassignments of nonsense codons
and sense codons are also under development. These methods enable the application of NCAAs
to enrich both fundamental and applied aspects of protein chemistry and biology. Sense codon
reassignment to NCAA could incur problems arising from the usage of anticodons as identity
elements on tRNA, and possible misreading of NNY codons by UNN anticodons. Evidence suggests
that the problem of anticodons as identity elements can be diminished or resolved through removal
from the tRNA of all identity elements besides the anticodon, and the problem of misreading of NNY
codons by UNN anticodon can be resolved by the retirement of both the UNN anticodon and its
complementary NNA codon from the proteome in the event that a restrictive post-transcriptional
modiﬁcation of the UNN anticodon by host enzymes to prevent the misreading cannot be obtained.
Keywords: synthetic life; non-canonical amino acid; rewritten genetic code; restrictive
post-transcriptional modiﬁcation; anticodon identity element

1. Introduction

The 100th anniversary of the birth of Francis Crick is an occasion that calls for celebration of
the double helix, triplet genetic code, tRNA, wobble rules, and aspects of molecular biology and
neurobiology advanced by his gifted insights.
The cooperation between RNA and protein founded on the triplet genetic code is pivotal to life,
and the development of the standard genetic code is the centerpiece in life’s emergence. The sharing of
the same protein alphabet by all living species suggests that the alphabet determined by the standard
code predated the earliest divergence of organisms. Yet evidence suggests that the early code began
with prebiotically-derived amino acids and expanded to include biosynthetically derived amino
acids, thus predicting that the code is intrinsically a mutable code. To put this prediction to the test,
experiments were performed in 1983 to determine the code’s mutability. These experiments led to
the isolation of genetic code mutants of the Trp-auxotroph Bacillus subtilis QB928 in which Trp has
been either replaced in the code by its normally toxic ﬂuoro analogues 4FTrp (4-ﬂuoroTrp), 5FTrp, and
6FTrp; or even displaced entirely by 4FTrp to become an inhibitory analogue [1–5]. This proof of the
mutability of the code opens up the code to revision and expansion, encoding NCAAs alongside CAAs
in the protein alphabet.
2. Synthetic Lifeform Production

Since the genetic code is the most basic attribute of living systems, genetic code mutants represent
the ultimate test-tube evolution [6]. Accordingly, organisms such as the B. subtilis strains that have

rejected Trp from their genetic codes may be designated as synthetic lifeforms, distinct from synthetic
biological constructs that contain novel genes and gene ensembles, but adhere strictly to the universal
protein and nucleic acid alphabets [7]. The synthetic lifeforms with altered protein alphabets can be
either optional or mandatory in their utilization of NCAAs, and the NCAAs can be incorporated
proteome-wide or localized to speciﬁc protein sites. Synthetic lifeforms using a revised DNA alphabet
where thymine is replaced by 5-chlorouracil on an optional or mandatory basis [8–10], or an extra
unnatural base pair exempliﬁed by dNaM-d5SICS has been added to the A-T and G-C pairs [11–13],
have since been isolated as well.
Since the isolation of the ﬁrst synthetic lifeforms from Bacillus subtilis, a number of different
methods have been developed for the production of synthetic lifeforms equipped with mutated genetic
codes and altered protein alphabets:
Proteome-wide replacement of CAA by NCAA: NCAAs that have acquired encoding by
the genetic code include ﬂuoroTrps in B. subtilis [1,4], E. coli and coliphages [14–16], and
L -β-(thieno[3,2-b]-pyrrolyl)alanine in E. coli [17]. With respect to 4FTrp, genome sequencing of the
successive mutant strains leading from wild-type B. subtilis to the HR23 strain which rejects Trp from
its genetic code, and on to revertant TR7 strains where Trp rejoins the code, revealed how 4FTrp and
Trp could be admitted into or excluded from the code as the result of a limited number of mutations
in oligogenic-barrier genes that have preserved the protein alphabet against change through the
ages [2,4,5].
NCAA insertion through suppression of a nonsense codon: To safeguard the ﬁdelity of translation,
aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) react with tRNAs cognate to the amino acid substrate, but not
tRNAs cognate to other amino acids. Surprisingly, however, when E. coli ARSs were presented
with tRNAs from other species, they reacted well with most tRNAs sourced from other bacteria,
but poorly with numerous tRNAs from another biological domain: with Halobacterium cutirubrum
tRNAs, they displayed only 1%–3% reactivity with tRNAs for Phe, Asp, Lys, and Pro, 0.4%–0.5% with
tRNAs for Tyr, Leu, and Arg, and 0% with tRNAs for Ser [18,19]. Such strikingly low inter-domain
reactivities made possible the design of ‘orthogonal’ ARS-tRNA pairs that do not interact productively
with tRNAs and ARSs of the host cell [20], notably based on the archaeal Methanocaldococcus TyrRS,
Methanosarcina PylRS, and SepRS from methanogens [21]. Using this approach, a wide range of
site-speciﬁc NCAA incorporations in bacterial and eukaryotic hosts including C. elegans and Xenopus
oocytes have been achieved based on suppression of nonsense codon [22–26]. Limitations of NCAA
insertion through nonsense codon suppression include low efﬁciency of NCAA translation at levels
close to those displayed by near-cognate CAAs, and competition from release factor for the nonsense
codon [21]. These limitations could be overcome by directed evolution, with up to three-fold reduction
of promiscuous aminoacylation of orthogonal tRNA by endogenous ARS through a combination of
positive selection for amber suppression activity and negative selection toward ARS [27,28]. Efﬁciency
also may be enhanced by the use of quadruplet-decoding ribosomes [29].
NCAA encoding through pyrrolysine and selenocysteine pathways: Since the nonsense codon UAG
can perform double duty as a termination signal and a codon for pyrrolysine (Pyl) depending on the
sequence context, PylRS and its cognate tRNA(Pyl) represent an endogenous orthogonal ARS-tRNA
pair [30], and NCAA encoding has been achieved through their adaptation to NCAAs [31–33].
Although PylRS is comparable in catalytic efﬁciency to other ARSs with regard to Pyl-tRNA(Pyl)
formation, engineered PylRS displayed 1000-fold reduction in catalytic efﬁciency toward NCAA [21],
again indicating the need for enhancement. The nonsense codon UGA, likewise, can perform double
duty as a termination signal and a codon for selenocysteine (Sec). The adaptation of the Sec pathway
to NCAA encoding is rendered difﬁcult by the requirement for a selenocysteine insertion sequence
(SECIS) motif, and the non-binding of Sec-tRNA(Sec) to EF-Tu. However, both of these hurdles have
been removed through the development of an effective tRNA(Sec) that incorporated Sec into proteins
via EF-Tu binding, thus converting the highly restricted occurrence of Sec only at SECIS-directed mRNA

78

contexts to unconstrained insertion as an NCAA anywhere in the proteome [34,35]. This liberated Sec
pathway therefore can be adapted to the incorporation of NCAAs as in the case of the Pyl pathway.
Proteome-wide reassignment of nonsense codon: To overcome the restriction of site-speciﬁc
incorporation of NCAA, nonsense codon encoding of NCAAs is being extended to the proteome-wide
scale by replacing all 314 UAG nonsense codons in E. coli by the synonymous UAA nonsense
codon using multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE) followed by hierarchical conjugative
assembly genome engineering (CAGE). The retired UAG codon is thus ready for proteome-wide
reassignment to NCAA [36].
Proteome-wide reassignment of sense codon: The genetic code contains only three nonsense codons
but 61 sense codons that might be reassignable to NCAAs. Reserving two codons for each CAA other
than Met and Trp still leaves many sense codons for reassignment to NCAAs. Reassignments of the rare
AGG and CGG codons of Arg to NCAAs have been achieved for homoArg and N6-(1-iminoethyl)Lys
via the pyrrolysine pathway [37–39]. As well, genome-wide replacement of 13 rare sense codons
from a panel of 42 highly-expressed essential genes of E. coli by their synonymous codons was
functionally tolerable [40], and an orthogonal IleRS-tRNA(Ile) pair from Mycoplasma mobile was found
that could decipher the AUA sense codon of E. coli, indicating the feasibility of reassigning this codon to
NCAA [41]. General reassignment of non-rare codons on a proteome-wide basis will entail large scale
genome reengineering employing either genome editing procedures or synthetic genomes exempliﬁed
by the Mycoplasma mycoides JCV1-syn1.0 genome [42]. To cope with the possibly severe adverse effects
of such reassignment on the overall performance of the proteome, it might be necessary in some cases
to increase gradually the NCAA/CAA incorporation ratio at the codon positions involved instead of
an abrupt switch from CAA to NCAA. In addition, important issues that need to be resolved include
the usage of anticodon as an identity element on tRNA, and the inherent ability of the UNN anticodon
to read all four codons in a family codon box.
3. Anticodons as Identity Elements

The selection of tRNA substrate by ARS for aminoacylation is guided by identity elements on
tRNA, e.g., the identity elements on B. subtilis tRNA(Trp) include G73 and its anticodon as major,
and A1-U72, G5-C68, and A9 as minor, identity elements [43]. The discriminator base N73 and the
anticodon are the most commonly encountered identity elements [44]. To reassign the CGA and CGG
codons of Arg to an NCAA, for instance, these codons need to be replaced by synonymous Arg codons,
and the tRNA(Arg)s that read CGA and CGG have to be deleted from the genome, followed by the
introduction of orthogonal NcaaARS and tRNA(Ncaa)s bearing UCG anticodon, or UCG and CCG
anticodons into the host cell. However, where ArgRS recognizes the anticodon as an identity element,
as in E. coli and yeast [44], the endogenous ArgRS in the host cell could misread the anticodon on the
newly-introduced tRNA(Ncaa)s as its cognate, and proceed to arginylate these tRNA(Ncaa)s [21,38,45].
If the anticodon represents the sole tRNA identity element recognized by ArgRS, the misreading error
may be difﬁcult to avoid. On the other hand, if ArgRS recognizes the anticodon along with other
co-identity elements, the magnitude of the misreading error would depend on whether the various
identity elements act additively or synergistically.
Earlier, when cloned bovine tRNA(Trp) bearing the A73 and G1-C72 identity elements was
reacted with human TrpRS, highly efﬁcient Trp-tRNA(Trp) formation was observed. When either A73
or G1-C72 was altered, efﬁciency was reduced to ∼25%. When both A73 and G1-C72 were altered,
or when the 1-72 base pair was disrupted, efﬁciency was reduced to <2.5% (Figure 1). These ﬁndings
showed that the identity elements A73 and G1-C72 acted synergistically, rather than additively in
attracting Trp-tRNA formation, such that alteration of either A73 or G1-C72 diminished the Trp-tRNA
formation by more than half. The physical basis of the synergism between A73 and G1-C72 was
demonstrated by NMR spectroscopy: a change in the chemical shift for the G1-C72 base pair became
manifest upon replacement of A73 by G73, with the G1 resonance moved in the 1 H dimension from
11.75 to 12.15 ppm [46].

Figure 1. Human TrpRS tryptophanylation of bovine tRNA(Trp) with varied N73 and 1-72
conﬁgurations (after [46]).

Moreover, the relative rate of Trp-tRNA formation by B. subtilis TrpRS was 100% for B. subtilis
tRNA, 0.5% for bovine tRNA, and 1.0% for Archaeglobus fulgidus tRNA. On the other hand, the relative
rate of Trp-tRNA formation by A. fulgidus TrpRS was 100% for A. fulgidus tRNA, 4% for bovine
tRNA and 5% for B. subtilis tRNA. Therefore, although the anticodon was a major identity element
for B. subtilis TrpRS, and both A. fulgidus tRNA(Trp) and bovine tRNA(Trp) carried the same CCA
anticodon as B. subtilis tRNA(Trp), B. subtilis TrpRS reacted poorly with bovine and A. fulgidus tRNAs,
indicating that the presence of a correct anticodon identity element was insufﬁcient to attract substantial
Trp-tRNA formation by B. subtilis TrpRS [46]. Altogether the ﬁndings suggest that the problem of
anticodon as identity element could be overcome or diminished in at least some instances by removing
from the orthogonal tRNA(Ncaa) all identity elements outside of the anticodon that could attract
misacylation by the ARS(Caa) for the CAA donating the codons to the NCAA.
4. Misreading by the UNN Anticodon

Since codon boxes are, as a rule, read by less than four anticodons, reading of multiple codons
by an anticodon is commonplace. This suggests that reassignment of just a single sense codon to an
NCAA can easily trigger misreading of a codon by a non-cognate anticodon belonging to the same box
except for specialized instances illustrated by the AUA codon [41]. On the other hand, because Ser is
allocated six codons in the code and the anticodon on tRNA(Ser) is also not an identity element in host
species such as E. coli and yeast [44], reassignment of the entire UCN Ser codon box to an NCAA could
be free of both the anticodon identity element problem and the UNN anticodon misreading problem.
However, this would leave only the two codons AGU and AGC for Ser. Since there are comparable
numbers of Ser and Glu residues in the E. coli proteome, and Glu functions well with only two codons,
Ser might manage with two as well. In contrast, splitting up an existing 1aa codon box may incur
misreading of NNU and NNC codons by the UNN anticodon.
Readings of codons by anticodons are governed by Crick’s wobble rules [47]. Evolution of tRNA
sequences indicates that there have been four major stages of wobble development [48]. In Stage 1
wobble, a single tRNA with a UNN anticodon reads all four codons in a codon box. As a result,
no codon box could accommodate more than a single amino acid. Stage 2 wobble allocates a GNN-UNN
anticodon duo to each box, thus allowing both 1aa and 2aa codon boxes. All eight standard 1aa boxes
and ﬁve standard 2aa boxes of Methanopyrus kandleri (Mka), which is most closely related to the
Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA), employ Stage 2 wobble. Some archaeons employ in
their standard boxes both Stage 2 wobble and Stage 3 wobble which allocates a GNN-UNN-CNN
80

MDPI Books

Life 2017, 7, 10

anticodon trio to each box. The majority of Archaea species use a Stage 3 wobble for all of their standard
boxes. Stage 4 wobble, mainly used by eukaryotes, adds yet another anticodon viz. A(I)NN to its
anticodon ensemble.
In Stage 1, the U-1st anticodon reads all four codons of a box in a two-out-of-three reading
mode [49,50]. In Stage 2, a G-1st anticodon reads the Y-3rd codons in a box; the U-1st anticodon
reads mainly or only the R-3rd codons in a 1aa box, but only the R-3rd codons in a 2aa box. Since the
UNN anticodon is inherently capable of two-out-of-three reading, some solution has to be developed
to disallow misreading of Y-3rd codons by UNN anticodon in a 2aa box [51,52]. In the course of
genetic code evolution, primitive organisms about to acquire Stage 2 wobble had to choose between
two solutions to this challenge [53,54]:
Solution I: Prohibit the reading of Y-3rd codons by UNN anticodon through its post-transcriptional
modiﬁcation to form a restricted *UNN anticodon capable of reading the R-3rd but not the Y-3rd
codons in a 2aa box; or
Solution II: Abandon the use of the A-3rd codon and U-1st anticodon in the 2aa box altogether,
leaving only a C-1st anticodon to read the G-3rd codon and a G-1st anticodon to read the Y-3rd codons.
Since UNN anticodons were already in use in all the codon boxes of Stage 1 organisms,
it was expeditious for the nascent Stage 2 organisms to adopt Solution I, using post-transcriptional
modiﬁcation enzymes to convert UNN anticodons into *UNN. Such conversion proceeded readily
in the CAN, AAN, GAN, and AGN boxes in the right half of the code that employs R-2nd codons,
but not in the codon boxes in the left half of the code that employs Y-2nd codons owing to the
different allowable codon-anticodon conﬁgurations in the two halves [55–57]. Among extant organisms,
modiﬁcations of U34 to form xm5 U34, s2 U34, and Um34 represent the major routes to a restricted
*UNN [58]. The recognition signals for these modiﬁcations are largely non-elucidated for any organism,
except that the signal for ribose methylation on N34 appears to reside outside the anticodon [59].
In splitting the four codons in a 1aa codon box such as the CCN box for Pro into two pairs, one
may leave the CCY codons to Pro and give the CCR codons to an NCAA, or vice versa. Giving the CCR
codons to NCAA could be preferable unless the existing UGG anticodon for Pro is already in the *UGG
form. This requires a search for suitable orthogonal tRNA(Ncaa)s bearing UGG and CGG anticodons.
Since a UGG anticodon might misread the CCU and CCC codons, the UGG anticodon on the sought-for
tRNA(Ncaa) should be conducive to being modiﬁed into a restricted *UGG by host enzymes. There is
a paucity of information on recognition signals on tRNA that direct the enzymic conversion of a
UNN anticodon to *UNN. More broadly, we earlier cloned the genes for B. subtilis, A. fulgidus, and
bovine tRNA(Trp)s into E. coli host, and examined the post-transcriptional modiﬁcations on their gene
products [46]. The results showed that (Table 1):
(a)

(b)

All the cloned tRNA(Trp)s displayed s4 U in resemblance to native E. coli tRNA(Trp) even though
native B. subtilis and native bovine tRNA(Trp)s were devoid of this modiﬁcation. Both cloned
B. subtilis and native E. coli tRNA(Trp)s contained Cm, although native B. subtilis tRNA(Trp)
lacked this modiﬁcation. Native bovine tRNA(Trp) contained m1 A and m2 G, whereas cloned
bovine and native E. coli tRNA(Trp)s were devoid of these modiﬁcations. These ﬁndings showed
the decisive inﬂuence of host enzymes regarding some modiﬁcations on exogenous tRNAs.
On the other hand, native and cloned B. subtilus tRNA(Trp)s both contained i6 A, but native E. coli
tRNA(Trp) did not. Also, native and cloned bovine tRNA(Trp)s both contained Gm, but native
E. coli tRNA(Trp) did not. These ﬁndings showed that the sequence of an exogenous tRNA could
be a more important determinant than host enzymes for other modiﬁcations.

Accordingly, when a UNN anticodon-bearing orthogonal tRNA(Ncaa) is introduced into a host
cell, both the sequence of the tRNA and the speciﬁcity of host enzymes could impact on the
post-transcriptional modiﬁcation proﬁle of the tRNA. As a result, there is a possibility, but no certainty,
that any orthogonal tRNA(Ncaa) with a UNN anticodon would be converted to a restricted tRNA(Ncaa)
with a *UNN anticodon. Therefore multiple candidate tRNA(Ncaa)s may have to be screened to ﬁnd
81

MDPI Books

Life 2017, 7, 10

one that yields a *UNN. Insofar that the UNN anticodons for all the 2aa codon boxes of any host cell
are prone to conversion to *UNN by host enzymes, the chances of a tRNA(Ncaa) attracting a similar
conversion by host enzymes might be increased if its anticodon loop sequence resembles those of the
UNN anticodon-bearing tRNAs for 2aa boxes in the host cell.

In the event that repeated trials fail to produce a *UGG-bearing tRNA(Ncaa) to read a CCA codon
to be reassigned to an NCAA, Solution II can be adopted by retiring all CCA codons from the proteome,
and deleting from the genome all tRNA(Pro)s that read the CCA codon. Although the presence of
unassigned codons that are not assigned to any amino acid or termination signal could be detrimental
to an organism, the extent of the detriment might not always be severe [53], and unassigned codons are
also known to exist in organisms [60,61]. Moreover, when the CCA codon is entirely retired from the
proteome, it becomes an absent codon rather than an unassigned codon and unable to cause damage
except where it reappears through random point mutations. Such random reappearances would be
tolerated by the cells as in the case of a great majority of random point mutations if they do not cause
signiﬁcant damage, and eliminated by natural selection if they do. Thus, either way, their perturbation
of the reassignment process could be limited.
5. Discussion

By means of electric discharge, high-energy particle bombardment, and conveyance on meteorites,
etc., prebiotic Earth was endowed with the presence of a range of different amino acids [62].
After primitive RNA genes accumulated through selection of aptamers and ribozymes over
non-functional RNAs to initiate the RNA world, attachment of amino acids to these functional
RNAs (fRNAs) furnished much needed extra sidechains to enhance catalytic and transporter
activities. The fRNAs developed mRNA domains to encode peptide prosthetic groups composed of
Phase 1 prebiotically-derived amino acids [48,63]. The sidechain imperative continued to propel the
coevolution of genetic code and amino acid biosynthesis, adding biosynthetically derived Phase 2
amino acids to the code [64,65]. Even after establishment of the standard genetic code, more Phase 3
amino acid residues are added to proteins via post-translational modiﬁcations (PTM) [66]. There are
more than 87,000 experimentally-identiﬁed PTMs on 530,264 proteins including phosphorylation,
acetylation, glycosylation, amidation, hydroxylation, and D-amino acids, etc., such that the rate of
detection of PTM sites is outpacing biological knowledge of the function of those modiﬁcations [67,68].
This ﬂourish of PTMs underlines the sustained strength of the sidechain imperative as a factor in
protein evolution. In just over three decades since the isolation of the B. subtilis genetic code mutants [1],
a wide range of mandatory and optional synthetic lifeforms have been developed incorporating a
comparable number of code mutation-induced Phase 4 NCAAs as PTM-induced Phase 3 NCAAs into
proteins [1,4,14–17,20–33,37], attesting to the continuing need, now scientiﬁcally-perceived instead of
evolution-driven, for more amino acid sidechains.
The methods that have been developed to produce Phase 4 protein alphabets include
proteome-wide replacement of CAA by NCAA, NCAA insertion through suppression of nonsense
codons, and NCAA encoding through the pyrrolysine and selenocysteine pathways. Efforts to

82

MDPI Books

Life 2017, 7, 10

encode NCAAs through proteome-wide reassignment of nonsense or sense codons are also ongoing.
Reassignment of non-rare codons is a large-scale operation, but genome editing and synthetic genomes
are powerful tools well suited to the task. Such reassignments may meet with hurdles posed by
anticodons that double as tRNA identity elements and, in the event of codon box splitting, misreading
of NNY codons by UNN anticodon. However, the results shown in Figure 1 and Table 1, together
with the option of Solution II abandoning both the NNA codon and UNN anticodon for a split box
suggest that these hurdles could be surmountable in at least some instances. Deepened insight into the
structure-function relations of ARSs and tRNAs, especially archaeal ones as a rich source of orthogonal
components, together with an understanding of the recognition signals on tRNA for the conversion of
UNN anticodons to *UNN in different host systems would be most valuable. In addition to NCAAs
that are unknown to living cells, Phase 3 NCAA residues produced by PTM likewise merit encoding
so they can become Phase 4 NCAAs, freed from their hitherto strict dependence on PTM enzymes
and insertable anywhere in the proteome. These PTM-generated NCAA residues have long served
important functions in vivo, and their catabolic products are non-toxic at modest levels.
In the triplet genetic code, the UCN Ser, CUN Leu, and CGN Arg codon boxes can be reassigned
to three NCAAs without codon box splitting. Allowing box splitting and leaving two codons to each
CAA outside of Met and Trp can accommodate up to 12 NCAAs. Switching from triplet to quadruplet
codons [29] gives rise to 256 codons, and addition of an extra X-Y base pair to the current A-T and G-C
base pairs [11–13] gives rise to 216 triplet codons, both vastly increasing the number of NCAAs that
might be packaged into the same code. Since different synthetic lifeforms may be allocated different
sets of NCAAs, there will be ample scope to construct revised triplet codes using just the A-T and G-C
base pairs, each encoding 20 CAAs, Sec, Pyl plus one or more NCAAs, for the exploration of wide
ranging applications of NCAA-enhanced protein alphabets including the following:
5.1. Protein Structure-Activity Relationships

Active sites of enzymes are often strongly conserved in localized sequence space owing to
an optimally evolved protein conﬁguration. However, the strong conservation renders it difﬁcult
to assess the uniqueness of the evolved conﬁguration. In this regard, when the genomes of TR7
revertants of synthetic lifeform HR23, in which Trp has regained the ability to support cell propagation,
were sequenced, their RNA polymerases were found to harbor the β-Glu433Lys, β -Ile280Thr or
β -Pro277His mutations even though the β-Glu433, β -Ile280 and β -Pro277 residues at the outer
claw-like region of bacterial RNAP where sigma factor binds are strongly conserved [5]. Without the
immense stress placed on the cells by the proteome-wide displacement of Trp by 4FTrp, it would be
highly unlikely to encounter the presence of β-Lys433, β’-Thr280, or β’-His277 in an alternative active
conﬁguration of the RNAP claw. Consequently, when NCAAs are inserted into diverse positions
throughout the proteome, they can reveal unforeseen insights into the structure-activity relationships
of many proteins.
5.2. Peptide and Protein Drugs

Novel peptide/protein drugs, antibodies and industrial proteins are applications that can beneﬁt
from NCAAs. Eight NCAA residues, including D- and DL-amino acids, have been incorporated
into icatibant, a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist decapeptide [69], and D-amino acid containing
peptides furnish candidate drugs to inhibit the aggregation of amyloid peptides in Alzheimer’s
disease [70]. Conversion of cystine to diselenide in alpha-selenoconotoxins increases drug efﬁcacy
through prevention of reduction by glutathione or serum albumin [71]. NCAA encoding would
accelerate development of such peptide or protein drugs where the presence of NCAA expands the
physicochemical properties of their sidechains. Since the ΔΔG for transfer from octanol to water
of 4FTrp, 6FTrp, or 5FTrp compared to Trp amounts to 0.42, 0.80, or 0.90 kcal/mole, respectively,
replacement of Trp by 4FTrp, 6FTrp or 5FTrp can bring about a graded increase in hydrophobicity [72];

83

MDPI Books

Life 2017, 7, 10

gamma-carboxyGlu can enhance charge intensity [73]; and irreversible attachment of the drugs to their
target sites can be achieved using NCAAs capable of click chemistry [21,22,74].
MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and peptide motifs such as zinc
ﬁngers, play important roles in gene regulation and represent potential therapeutic agents [75–78].
Nuclease-resistant nucleobase-peptides and nucleobase-proteins comprising both regular peptide
segments and polyamide nucleic acid (PNA) [79] segments can be synthesized through the encoded
incorporation of NCAAs bearing U(T), C, A, and G nucleobase sidechains. Given the capability of
PNA for strong complementary base-pairing, nucleobase-peptides can provide therapeutic agents that
interact with DNA advantageously with cooperation between the nucleobase sidechains and other
amino acid sidechains.
5.3. Enhancement of Biological Fitness

The evolution of the genetic code was guided by the increased biological ﬁtness made possible by
extra amino acid sidechains in the protein alphabet, and this can be continued through expansion of
the code to include NCAAs as exempliﬁed by the ﬁnding that placement of 3-iodoTyr into the Tyr39
position of holing enhanced the competitive ﬁtness of T7 phage [80]. Asn and Gln are highly prone to
thermal deamidation [81], and the more thermostable albizzine (α-amino-β-ureidopropionic acid) has
been proposed as a possible Gln replacement [82]. Since the deamidation of Asn and Gln in proteins
could contribute to senescence, as well as amyloid formation in dementia, type 2 diabetes, cataracts
and Parkinson’s disease [83–85], it would be instructive to replace Asn and Gln residues in proteins
with competent yet more stable analogues, if such can be found, to assess the roles of Asn and Gln as
factors of senescence and human diseases.
5.4. Metabolic and Biomimetic Engineering

The opening up of selenoprotein biochemistry via unconstrained proteome-wide Sec encoding
enables the replacement of disulﬁde bridges by diselenide bridges in proteins [34,35]. As a result,
metabolic engineering can be carried out replacing glutathione (GSSG) as a cellular redox buffer
by selenoglutathione (GSeSeG): otherwise selenoglutathione would destabilize disulﬁde bridges in
proteins, for the E◦ ’ of −407 mV for GSeSeG is much more negative than that of −256 mV for GSSG [86].
The ﬁnding of 102 to 104 -fold faster reduction of thioredoxin by synthetic seleno-glutaredoxin 3
compared to glutaredoxin 3 [87] suggests that replacement of glutathione by selenoglutathione could
facilitate reductive processes such as nitrogen ﬁxation [88,89].
The enzyme farnesyltransferase adds the 15-carbon farnesyl group to Cys in a CaaX motif at the
carboxyl terminus of a protein, thereby favoring attachment of the protein to membranes. Ras proteins
are activated by farnesylation and association with the inner surface of the plasma membrane [90].
Encoded incorporation of farnesylated NCAAs into various soluble proteins (if necessary using
a modiﬁed EF-Tu that accommodates a bulky amino acid sidechain, or through sidechain add-on by
means of click chemistry) can therefore relocate them on to membranes, thereby allowing a shift of
protein distribution from cytosol to membranes. Such studies will contribute to delineation of the
relationships between cellular architecture, regulation, and carcinogenesis.
Lipoproteins play important roles in metabolism and biological structures, but they are typically
maintained by non-covalent rather than covalent binding between lipid and protein. However, akin to
covalent nucleobase-proteins, covalent lipoproteins can be formed by incorporating lipoidal NCAAs
with for example sphingosine, sphingomyelin, fatty acid, isoprenoid, or sterol type sidechains into
proteins. The covalent lipoproteins can potentially be employed to produce artiﬁcial myelin sheaths
and skin grafts, or circulating amphiphiles for coating the inner wall of blood vessels to prevent
vascular plaques. They can also be used in a new generation of liposomes embedded with protein
receptors, transporters, and ion channels as integral parts of the membrane.
An important goal in artiﬁcial photosynthesis for hydrogen fuel production is to ﬁnd responsive
matrices that mimic the protein matrices of natural photosynthesis, which through concerted motion

84

MDPI Books

Life 2017, 7, 10

can reduce entropy production and maximize the performance of essential components of the
process [91–95]. Like natural photosynthesis, which proceeds in photosynthetic membranes where
chlorophylls are held in place by speciﬁc proteins, covalent lipoprotein membranes containing ordered
arrays of light harvesters, reaction centers, hydrogenase catalytic sites, etc. may provide suitable
materials for engineering the necessary responsive matrices.
In conclusion, synthetic lifeforms employing rewritten genetic codes can be produced by a number
of different methods. These methods will widen the scope of synthetic life research, bringing unique
insights into protein chemistry and biology as well as a wide range of applications. Building the
rewritten genetic codes and the novel protein alphabets ushered in by them, optimizing their uses and
preventing all possibilities of misuse, will represent a momentous development that advances science,
medicine and biotechnology.

Abstract: This year marks the 48th anniversary of Francis Crick’s seminal work on the origin of the
genetic code, in which he ﬁrst proposed the “frozen accident” hypothesis to describe evolutionary
selection against changes to the genetic code that cause devastating global proteome modiﬁcation.
However, numerous efforts have demonstrated the viability of both natural and artiﬁcial genetic code
variations. Recent advances in genetic engineering allow the creation of synthetic organisms that
incorporate noncanonical, or even unnatural, amino acids into the proteome. Currently, successful
genetic code engineering is mainly achieved by creating orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA/synthetase
pairs to repurpose stop and rare codons or to induce quadruplet codons. In this review, we summarize
the current progress in genetic code engineering and discuss the challenges, current understanding,
and future perspectives regarding genetic code modiﬁcation.
Keywords: frozen accident; genetic code; genetic engineering; evolution; synthetic biology

1. Introduction

In 1968, Francis Crick ﬁrst proposed the frozen accident theory of the genetic code [1]. The 20
canonical amino acids were once believed to be immutable elements of the code. The genetic code
appears to be universal, from simple unicellular organisms to complex vertebrates. Yet in contrast to
studies of the natural selection of lifeforms wherein the gradual evolution of species can be observed
in a myriad of taxa, relatively few examples of natural genetic code variations (e.g., selenocysteine [2],
pyrrolysine [3,4], and stop codon read through [5,6]) have been observed. Different explanations have
been proposed to address these variations, such as the codon capture hypothesis [7], the ambiguous
intermediate hypothesis [8], and the genome streamlining hypothesis [9]. These hypotheses have been
reviewed elsewhere [10,11]. Although some existing noncanonical amino acids (NCAAs) are known to
be compatible with enzymatic aminoacylation [12–20], the 20 canonical amino acids in the standard
genetic code have been stringently selected over the course of biological evolution. Organisms that
require peptides with modiﬁed side chains will often resort to pre-translational or post-translational
modiﬁcations to incorporate NCAAs [21–26]. Some organisms require alternative genetic codes to
survive in harsh living conditions [27].
Genetic code engineering refers to the modiﬁcation, or the directed evolution of cellular
machineries, in order to incorporate NCAAs into the proteome of an organism. In general, NCAAs
can be artiﬁcially incorporated in a site-speciﬁc or proteome-wide manner. In the former, scientists
have attempted to artiﬁcially engineer organisms for compatibility with various NCAAs by employing
orthogonal tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pairs [28–32]. In the latter, an organism is forced
to take up speciﬁc NCAAs, followed by isolating mutants in media containing NCAAs [33–35].
Currently, researchers are recording cellular responses and genetic changes in engineered organisms
to understand the mechanisms behind the use of alternative genetic codes. Such efforts enable

an understanding of the evolutionary course of the genetic code and provide a foundation for the
derivation of additional alternative codes, a particularly important feature in the era of synthetic biology
given the increased focus on engineering synthetic organisms with modiﬁed genetic codes [36,37].
Engineered genetic code holds tremendous potential in the ﬁeld of protein engineering and xenobiology,
which was extensively reviewed by Budisa et al. in 2017 [38].
In this review, we ﬁrst give a brief introduction of current studies on both site-speciﬁc and
proteome-wide incorporation of NCAAs. Next, we will focus on the challenges of engineering
organisms to use modiﬁed genetic codes and their implications, such as inhibitory effects caused by
NCAAs. Finally, we will discuss current trends in this research area.

2.1. Incorporation of NCAAs into Speciﬁc Sites

Currently, three major approaches are used to engineer the genetic code in a site-speciﬁc manner:
(1) amber codon suppression; (2) rare sense codon reassignment; and (3) quadruplet codon. Figure 1
provides a schematic illustration of each method. Because organisms such as E. coli BL21 rarely use the
amber stop codon (UAG) (only 275 of 4160 stop codons in BL21 are amber codons), which minimizes
disturbances to existing protein termination signals, this codon has been preferably selected for NCAA
encoding [30,39,40]. To enhance the efﬁciency of amber codon recognition by the orthogonal tRNACUA ,
Release Factor 1 [41,42] is usually mutated or knocked out [43], thus enabling orthogonal tRNACUA
to recognize and increase its competitive binding to the amber codon [30] (Figure 1a). The role of
different artiﬁcial tRNA/tRNA synthetase pairs, as well as their structural relationship with different
NCAAs, were extensively reviewed by Anaëlle et al. [44].
Rare sense codon assignment [45–47], which is based on a similar principle, repurposes rare
sense codons, particularly rare codons including AGG [45,46] and AUA [47], using newly designed
tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pairs. In this method, the introduction of a NCAA during protein
synthesis requires either competition between a genetically modiﬁed tRNA and the corresponding
wild-type tRNA [45] or the inhibition of wild-type tRNA via the deletion of its tRNA synthetase [47]
(Figure 1b).
To circumvent the limitations of reprogramming existing codons, some researchers have explored
NCAA encoding via expansion of the genetic code using quadruplet codons [48–53]. In brief, a
single-base (e.g., “U”) is inserted after a canonical triplet codon (e.g., a “CUC” triplet codon) to
form a frameshift mutation at the speciﬁc position (Figure 1c). The additional base also creates a
new quadruplet codon (e.g., “CUCU”) at this position, which can be recognized by an engineered
quadruplet tRNA (e.g., tRNAAGAG ). Early versions of the quadruplet in vivo coding system were
initially tested in E. coli [48,51,52], followed by Xenopus oocytes [49] and mammalian cells [50,53]. It is
also worth mentioning that noncanonical RNA translations, such as the use of tetra- and penta-codon,
were observed in mitochondria; however, the 4th and 5th nucleotides were found to be silent during
translation [54]. More mechanistic studies would be required to establish their roles in genetic
code engineering.
Although the site-speciﬁc incorporation approach is arguably the most widely used to produce
artiﬁcial proteins with NCAAs, some challenges can limit the stability of the engineered code.
The efﬁciency of an engineered tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pair must be high enough to
minimize the generation of truncated proteins [55]. Methods such as orthogonal ribosome use can lead
to a threefold improvement in the efﬁciency of unnatural amino acid incorporation [55]. Endogenous
tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pairs can also be engineered to incorporate unnatural amino
acids. For example, by changing the phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase amino acid recognition site,
phenylalanine analogs such as p-Cl-phenylalanine or p-Br-phenylalanine can be successfully charged
to tRNAPhe [14,56]. Advances in genome editing techniques, such as multiplex automated genomic

engineering [31] and CRISPR/Cas [51], may further increase the efﬁciency and accuracy of NCAA
incorporation in speciﬁc sites of the proteome.

Figure 1. An overview of approaches to incorporate NCAAs into speciﬁc sites. (a) The wild-type
release factor is mutated or knocked out, allowing the newly introduced tRNACUA to read through the
stop codon, followed by NCAA incorporation with assistance from the compatible aminoacyl-tRNA
synthetase. (b) The tRNA and corresponding tRNA synthetase for a rare sense codon are genetically
engineered to confer the ability to encode NCAA. (c) A single-base is inserted after the canonical codon
(e.g. “CUC” for Leu). The newly introduced quadruplet tRNA (e.g., tRNAAGAG ) can encode NCAA by
targeting the quadruplet codon “CUCU.”

2.2. Proteome-Wide Incorporation of NCAAs

Proteome-wide incorporation offers an alternative approach toward unnatural amino acid
incorporation. In the most common approach, amino acid uptake is artiﬁcially controlled by feeding
auxotrophs with NCAAs [33–35] (Figure 2a). Attempts to control NCAA synthesis have involved
supplying organisms with NCAA precursors [57–62] (Figure 2b), which is also known as metabolic
engineering [63,64]. In one example, the precursor L-β-thieno [3,2-b]pyrrolyl ([3,2]Trp) was fed to a
tryptophan (Trp)-auxotrophic E. coli capable of synthesizing [3,2]Tpa (a Trp analog) to generate mutants
that could propagate on L-β-(thieno [3,2-b]pyrrolyl)alanine ([3,2]Tpa) [57] (Figure 2b). Although
directly feeding auxotrophs with NCAAs is a simpler approach, metabolic engineering could reduce
the unwanted effects of impure commercial NCAAs [57].

Figure 2. An overview of proteome-wide approaches to incorporate NCAAs. (a) The NCAA enters a
cell via membrane transporters or diffusion across the membrane. (b) The NCAA precursor similarly
enters a cell in which it will be used to synthesize NCAAs. Following several generations of propagation
with either the NCAA or its precursor, cells that can stably utilize the NCAA are selected.

Regardless of approach, the incorporation of NCAAs in the proteome may negatively affect
the growth of an organism. The inherent toxicities of many unnatural amino acids could suppress
propagation of the wild-type strain and select mutants that respond favorably to the NCAA, ultimately
causing rejection of the expanded genetic code [34,35]. In the following section, we will focus on the
challenges in genetic code modiﬁcation.
3. Challenges of Genetic Code Engineering
3.1. Inhibitory Effects of Engineered Genetic Codes

The growth inhibitory effects caused by NCAAs, which have been demonstrated in different
species including bacteria [65–67], yeasts [68], insects [69,70], and mammals [71], comprise one major
challenge encountered during genetic code modiﬁcation. The inhibitory effects of NCAAs are mainly
attributable to two aspects. First, minor structural and chemical differences between NCAAs and their
canonical counterparts can drastically affect enzymatic activities [72–75]. Second, these structural and
chemical differences may also negatively affect protein synthesis, as some NCAAs cannot be efﬁciently
charged to tRNAs by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases [15,76]. A better understanding of the key genes
and cellular responses associated with these modiﬁed genetic codes is of paramount importance to
alleviating these inhibitory effects.
3.2. Discovering the Key Genes Controlling the Genetic Code

The growth inhibitory potentials of NCAAs create negative selective pressure, while the organism
adapts to the modiﬁed genetic code. One effective strategy for overcoming this evolutionary barrier
comprises an increase in the mutation rate via mutagenesis with the expectation of generating beneﬁcial
mutations that would favor the NCAA. Wong and colleagues isolated mutants from a Trp auxotroph
(Bacillus subtilis str. QB928) via sequential mutagenesis in an early attempt to modify the genetic
code. The resultant HR23 strain could propagate indeﬁnitely on 4-ﬂuoro-tryptophan (4FTrp) but
became inviable on canonical Trp [34,35]. As Trp is encoded by a single codon (UGG), the research by
Wong and colleagues provided the ﬁrst evidence of codon membership malleability under external

93

MDPI Books

Life 2017, 7, 12

selection pressure. Subsequently, Yu et al. traced mutations in intermediate mutants, as well as the
HR23 strain [77]. A nonsense mutation in the Trp operon RNA-binding attenuation protein (TRAP),
which controls transcriptional attenuation of the Trp operon [78,79] and translational repression of Trp
transporters [80–83], was shared by all mutants. This lack of TRAP would increase 4-FTrp uptake to
compensate for the relatively low charge rate of 4-FTrp to tRNATrp [15].
In a separate attempt, Bacher et al. isolated E. coli mutants that could propagate in medium
wherein 4-FTrp comprised ~99% of available Trp. However, the mutant strains could not grow
indeﬁnitely under these conditions and required minimal canonical Trp [33]. E. coli mutants were
found to harbor several mutations affecting genes such as aroP, which encodes an aromatic amino
acid transporter [84], and tyrR, which encodes the associated regulator [85]. Mutated aroP and tyrR
might cooperatively increase 4-FTrp uptake, similar to the effect of TRAP knockout in B. subtilis. Taken
together, these ﬁndings suggest that an efﬁcient NCAA uptake system is essential to accommodation
of the modiﬁed genetic codes.
RNA polymerase might also play a key role in controlling the genetic code. The above-mentioned
B. subtilis mutant HR23 was found to harbor a nonsynonymous mutation in the RNA polymerase
subunit gene (rpoB) that was absent from all other intermediate strains that could still propagate on Trp,
suggesting a potential role for this mutation in switching membership of the UGG codon from Trp to
4-FTrp [77]. In an independent study of amber codon-directed 3-iodotyrosine (3-iodoTyr) incorporation
in E. coli, a rpoB mutation was found to confer rifampicin resistance via amber suppression at
Gln513 [86], and the same research group also engineered a bacteriophage, T7, that could incorporate
3-iodoTyr at amber codons [29]. In that study, Hammerling et al. observed high mutation frequencies
in genes encoding RNA polymerase and the lysis timing regulator type II holin. The authors suggested
that these two genes played important roles in the evolution of the expanded genetic code [29].
These studies have shed light on the previously unexplored roles of key genes in genetic code identity.
3.3. Lack of Transcriptomic and Proteomic Studies Related to Engineered Genetic Codes

In addition to mutations, gene and protein expression proﬁles might also reveal key factors needed
to ﬁne-tune the use of modiﬁed genetic codes. Technologies such as RNA-seq and mass spectrometry
can be used to investigate the cellular responses of organisms in high resolution. RNA-seq was used
to compare the cellular responses between mutant (grown on 4-FTrp) and wild-type strains of the
above-mentioned B. subtilis HR23 mutant (unpublished data). Here, a gene ontology analysis of the
gene expression proﬁles of these strains demonstrated enrichment of genes related to reactive oxygen
species responses and branched-chain amino acid biosynthetic processes among upregulated genes,
and enrichment of genes related to siderophore biosynthetic processes among downregulated genes
(unpublished data). Unsurprisingly, stress response genes were modulated in response to the new
genetic code, and the downregulation of siderophore biosynthetic process related genes was consistent
with a previous observation of the reduced growth rate of HR23 cells grown on 4-FTrp [77] because
iron homeostasis is closely related to bacterial growth [87]. This unique set of data was the ﬁrst to
demonstrate the adaptation of an organism to a new genetic code at the transcriptomic level.
Methanosarcina acetivorans is a methanogenic archaea strain that uses the alternative genetic codon
UAG to encode pyrrolysine (Pyl) [88]. O’Donoghue et al. attempted to reduce the genetic code of this
strain by deleting tRNAPyl , thus blocking the incorporation of Pyl in the proteome. A comparison of
the proteomes of mutant and wild-type M. acetivorans strains revealed that most upregulated peptides
were related to methanogenesis, protein synthesis, and the stress response [89], suggesting that, in this
organism, various stress response genes must be ﬁne-tuned before a reduced genetic code can be used.
Very few transcriptomic and proteomic studies of organisms with modiﬁed genetic codes have
been conducted, and we have only glimpsed the potential factors involved in adaptation to modiﬁed
genetic codes. Additional genes that contribute to this adaptation might remain to be discovered.
In the future, studies of gene and protein expression in organisms with modiﬁed genetic codes will
be necessary.

3.4. Environmental Factors Affecting Adaptation to Engineered Genetic Codes

MDPI Books

Life 2017, 7, 12

Environmental factors, such as the growth medium and selection method, are important when
optimizing the use of a modiﬁed genetic code. The amino acid source is the ﬁrst and most obvious
factor, as an organism can either take up NCAAs directly from the environment or synthesize them
using environmentally available molecules. If the source of NCAAs is from the environment, mutations
in amino acid transporters are often needed to facilitate NCAA uptake [33,77].
Positive selection pressure is also needed to maintain stability of the modiﬁed genetic code.
In a previous study, incorporation of the methionine analog azidohomoalanine (Aha) into the coat
protein of a human adenovirus and the subsequent addition of a folate group to Aha facilitated
adenoviral infection in mouse hosts [90]. In other words, adenovirus strains that can use modiﬁed
Aha have a selective survival advantage over other strains. In a more recent study of different
E. coli strains, the site-speciﬁc incorporation of two tyrosine analogs in β-lactamase was selected,
and enzymatic function was found to depend on the presence of these analogs [91]. As described
above regarding adenovirus, E. coli mutants that could utilize NCAAs enjoyed a selective advantage
under growth mediums containing certain classes of antibiotics [91]. In one interesting example, even
the carbon source may affect the selection of genetic codes by the Pyl-utilizing bacteria Acetohalobium
arabaticum [92]. A. arabaticum used the standard genetic code when grown on pyruvate, but gained
the ability to use an expanded genetic code that included Pyl in the presence of the alternative carbon
source trimethylamine [92].
4. Future Directions

Current efforts in genetic code engineering have reshaped our ideas regarding genetic code
evolution and have paved the way for expanding the genetic alphabet. Based on these studies, we have
outlined the key steps by which an organism accommodates a modiﬁed genetic code (Figure 3). During
adaptation, mutations in amino acid transporters and/or their key regulators allow more efﬁcient
NCAA uptake, possibly by increasing the number of amino acid transporters [33,77]. Mutations in the
key genes might also favor the use of a modiﬁed genetic code [29,33,77,86]. Additionally, environmental
positive selection forces contribute to stability of the modiﬁed genetic code [77,91,92]. Currently, the
genomic changes in organisms with modiﬁed genetic codes have been well explored [29,33,77,86]
relative to transcriptomic (unpublished data) and proteomic [89] changes. Future trends in elucidation
of the biological mechanisms underlying genetic code modiﬁcations include the integration of genomic,
transcriptomic, and proteomic data and the reﬁning of functional study targets.
From the viewpoint of synthetic biology and xenobiology, genetic code engineering increases the
repertoire of building blocks available for protein engineering, thus enabling the development of novel
proteins that would be impossible with canonical amino acids [38,93]. Xenobiology is an emerging
ﬁeld that involves synthesizing xenonucleic acids other than the canonical nucleic acids with adenine
(A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G) as bases, with alternative pairing rules for protein
engineering [94]. It has been demonstrated experimentally that two such xenonucleic acids can be
integrated into the current DNA backbone [95–97], and more have been tested for their potentials as
novel building blocks of DNA [98]. With the addition of xenonucleic acids, the number of encoded
amino acids is likely to be increased to far beyond 20 [94].
High-throughput genome editing technologies, such as MAGE [36] and the emerging CRISPR/Cas
technology [99], allow an organism’s genetic code to be directly rewritten [37,100] and facilitate the
creation of synthetic life [101]. Although the ﬁrst synthetic minimal bacterial genome still uses the
standard genetic code [101], it is now possible to synthesize genomes based on alternative genetic codes.
A full exploration of the possibilities enabled by genetic code engineering requires an understanding
of the key molecular biological and biochemical mechanisms underlying the modiﬁcations. Gradual
efforts to address this main question may improve our understanding of the process of genetic code
evolution and lay a better foundation for future synthetic biology research.

Abstract: A signiﬁcant part of the genetic code likely originated via a chemical interaction, which
should be experimentally veriﬁable. One possible veriﬁcation relates bound amino acids (or
perhaps their activated congeners) and ribonucleotide sequences within cognate RNA binding
sites. To introduce this interaction, I ﬁrst summarize how amino acids function as targets for RNA
binding. Then the experimental method for selecting relevant RNA binding sites is characterized.
The selection method’s characteristics are related to the investigation of the RNA binding site model
treated at the outset. Finally, real binding sites from selection and also from extant natural RNAs
(for example, the Sulfobacillus guanidinium riboswitch) are connected to the genetic code, and by
extension, to the evolutionary progression that produced the code. During this process, peptides
may have been produced directly on an instructive amino acid binding RNA (a DRT; Direct RNA
Template). Combination of observed stereochemical selectivity with adaptation and co-evolutionary
reﬁnement is logically required, and also potentially sufﬁcient, to create the striking order conserved
throughout the present coding table.
Keywords: binding; triplet; codon; anticodon; DRT

1. Introduction
1.1. The Argument

In all likelihood, construction of the genetic code required speciﬁc interactions between amino
acids and RNAs, acting alone, before peptides could be encoded. Close study of this molecular
interaction, therefore, is one of the most promising routes we possess to the origin of the code and
translation itself. Here we test for unexpectedly frequent cognate coding triplets within, taking an
essential role in, a speciﬁc set of RNA-amino acid binding sites.
1.2. Amino Acids as RNA Ligands

Amino acids, though they are much smaller (MW ≈ 110) than nucleotides (MW ≈ 340), present
two faces for interaction by nucleotides in RNA. As judged from crystal structures of riboswitches [1],
RNA sites necessarily allow conserved, highly polar α-carbon groups (like carboxyl and amino) to be
ﬁxed in space by a convergence of highly directional polar interactions, such as hydrogen bonds [2].
With such a ﬁxed, common foundation, an RNA binding site can also make bonds to a side chain group
(Figure 1). This double-ended “polar proﬁle” [1], of course, only applies to amino acids with two polar
centers to offer. Further, even with possible bi-directional interactions in hand, other constraints (such
as the selection for small site size) will favor interactions with one locus or the other.

Figure 1. Amino acids studied by selection. The drawing divides the amino acids into two sites of
possible interaction, divided by a horizontal dashed line. Firstly, α-carbon groups, which can make
favorable polar interactions with RNA in every case. Then side chains, which can make stabilizing
RNA contacts when their varied polar character allows. Val = valine; Ile = isoleucine; Leu = leucine;
Gln = glutamine; Phe = phenylalanine; Tyr = tyrosine; Trp = tryptophan; His = histidine; Arg = arginine.
His imidazole is drawn protonated, because the major His site [3] and the His-Phe peptide site as
well [4] prefer protonated His imidazole.

For the purposes of biological structure and coding, we will be interested only in sites that include
interactions with a side chain. Thus, relevant RNAs will bind both α-carbon/side chain or side chain
only. Such sites are amino acid speciﬁc, and thus allow encoding of the amino acid. These distinctions
are crucial to the function of RNA binding sites, because double-ended sites yield greater energies
of interaction (ΔG < 0) than single ended sites. For similar reasons, double-ended sites have greater
stereoselectivities because they localize the sidechain (which transits the carbon tetrahedron when an
L -amino acid becomes a D -amino acid).
We can make these descriptions quantitative [1]. Based on 337 independently-derived binding
sites for nine of the standard protein amino acids, potentially single-ended RNA sites have KD from
10−2 to 10−3 M/ΔGbind −2.8 to −4 kcal/mol. The more intimately engaged amino acids, presenting
two sites of interaction, have KD from 10−4 to 10−6 M/ΔGbind from −5.5 to −8 kcal/mol at 25 ◦ C. The
stronger afﬁnities are clearly consistent with several intermolecular bonds, to two sites.
Switching to stereoselectivity, apparently single-ended sites range from 1-fold (no distinction) to
≈30-fold (0–2 kcal/mol), and 10- to several thousand-fold (1–5 kcal/mol) in double-ended amino acid
binding sites.
1.3. A Substantially Single-Ended Example Site, Isoleucine (Ile)

Notably, a less polar side chain does not rule out all amino acid selectivity. Hydrophobic sidechains
like Val (valine) and Ile (isoleucine) (Figure 1) are of interest because they are observed in spark tube
experiments [5], and are therefore thought of as primitive [6]. Despite these distinctions, they do
not offer polar sidechain interactions. Nevertheless, an RNA site selected for L-Val [7] prefers it by
1.6 kcal/mol to L-α-amino-butyrate (one methylene group smaller). A site selected for l-Ile [8] prefers
it by 0.82 kcal/mol to L-valine (one methylene group smaller). These ﬁndings raised the possibility of
speciﬁc RNA bonds to aliphatic sidechains. However, these speciﬁcities are now instead believed to
result from use of the size of the sidechain [1] as an essential site structural element, because further
decreases in side chain size after removal of the ﬁrst methylene have little effect.
1.4. A Frequently Double-Ended Example Site, Arginine (Arg)

The arginine (Arg) side chain features a terminal guanidinium ion. The ion is planar, aromatic,
positively charged, and offers a pattern of hydrogen bonding that matches the edge of nucleobases
extremely well. This makes Arg sites very frequent in RNA; for example, such sites are smaller than
sites for other amino acids [9]. In tallies of the content of RNA-protein interfaces, arginine provides
the most numerous contacts [10]. This signiﬁcance extends to regulatory interactions, where Arg

103

MDPI Books

Life 2017, 7, 13

contacts with RNA mediate regulatory modulation, for example, in the TAR peptide of HIV [11,12].
Further, Arg is unique in having unusual general interactions with folding RNAs, where it uniquely
destabilizes tertiary folding, both slowing formation and speeding the breaking of a tertiary RNA
contact [13]. For parallel reasons, it is no surprise that the ﬁrst-detected speciﬁc amino acid binding
site on RNA was for Arg [14]; the amino acid competes with G nucleotides for interaction with the
splicing cosubstrate site on Tetrahymena self-splicing rRNA [15].
The ability of speciﬁc RNA folds to bind one or both amino acid domains will be a crucial point
of discussion below.
2. The General Study of Amino Acid-RNA Binding by RNA

In order to generalize about amino acid-ribonucleotide interfaces, it is productive to study a
number of them, involving bound amino acids of different types (Figure 1). The selection and cloning
of RNAs [16–18] speciﬁcally eluted by cognate free amino acids [19] from carboxyl-immobilized amino
acid columns provided this opportunity. Immediately above, some properties of binding sites obtained
in this way have been listed. Below, I characterize the way the selection method produces its results to
provide context for interpretation of now-numerous, newly-selected binding site sequences.
2.1. The Afﬁnity Method

Amino acids are immobilized at concentrations of several mM to tens of mM, usually by coupling
their carboxyls to make amides, using amines linked to a chromatographic support via a neutral
connecting arm. Large populations of randomized RNA sequences will contain some active amino acid
sites that bind to such an immobilized amino acid. These bound RNAs can be eluted, after washing
away unbound molecules, with solutions of amino acid. In effect, a small minority of RNA amino
acid sites declare themselves by ﬁrst becoming immobile on the ﬁxed amino acids of the column, then
being mobilized by the minor solution change produced by addition of a low concentration of, say,
dissolved mM L-histidine (His) in column buffer. Because initial randomized sequences are usually
ﬂanked by constant sequences complementary to primers, RNAs that bind pure free L-amino acid,
D -amino acid, or derivatives can be saved as DNAs, which are ampliﬁed, then transcribed from a
promoter in a constant region to later use them.
Such afﬁnity chromatographic procedures purify L-Ile-binding RNAs by ≈100-fold when
ﬁrst applied [20], typically declining to 1-fold (no puriﬁcation) after ﬁve or six chromatographyampliﬁcation cycles, at which time ≈20% of transcripts are eluted by isoleucine.
2.2. Simple, Abundant Sites

It is vital to appreciate the target(s) detected by afﬁnity selection. Experiments on the origin
of the code do not seek sites with optimized performance, but instead, the simplest sites. That is,
shorter RNAs that may exhibit less impressive afﬁnities and selectivity [21]. This is because a primitive
environment is likely to be restrictive to RNA synthesis and survival. Accordingly, the molecules most
easily accessed, least sensitive to physical or chemical attack, seem the appropriate targets.
That is—it certainly is possible to do selections that optimize a function. Selecting RNAs that
slowly release a ligand selects most stable binding, for example, by L-Arg [22]. Alternatively, if a
selection allows RNAs to compete for reaction at a limited number of sites, selection of the fastest
reacting can be the result [23,24]. However, in the absence of such functional pressures, the most
numerous RNAs, or most probable, or the simplest, are the ones readily isolated.
The latter case describes afﬁnity selection. A 1 ml afﬁnity column containing 1 mM ligand has
6 × 1017 potential RNA binding sites. Roughly 1015 total RNAs are added to initiate a selection, and
a small fraction of these fold to produce amino acid binding sites. If 10−10 of random sequences
have active sites [25], 105 molecules of RNAs assort themselves among 6 × 1017 loci. Competition is
vanishingly rare, even after selection has greatly increased the active RNA fraction.

Using equations for afﬁnity chromatography at equilibrium [26], it can be shown [19] that
a ‘typical’ column afﬁnity selection recovers RNAs with KD ≤ approximately half the eluant
concentration; KD ≤ 2.5 mM for free ligand when RNA is eluted with 5 mM ligand. This ability
to examine simple RNAs with afﬁnities into the mM range is another of the qualities that speciﬁcally
suit afﬁnity chromatography to coding studies.
2.2.1. Number of Essential Nucleotides

Usually, one can deﬁne nucleotides essential to RNA site functions using straightforward
biochemical criteria. Such nucleotides are conserved in independent isolates; protected or sensitized to
chemical probes by interaction with speciﬁc RNA ligands; or alter RNA activities if they are previously
altered chemically or by mutation (e.g., [27]). The biochemically deﬁned active site is the sum of such
functional nucleotides, the number of “Implicated Site Nucleotides” (ISN). Implicated Site Nucleotides
differ from the constellation of atoms also called nucleotides by a structural biologist, and sometimes
the distinction is essential.
Though usually obvious, site nucleotides can occasionally be elusive. In the simplest L-tryptophan
(Trp) site [28], a G ﬂanking the amino acid binding loop is absolutely required for function, but so
variable in position and in surrounding structure that it was not evidently conserved, and so was not
initially detected [29]. Nevertheless, such cryptic requirements still affect the frequency of Trp-binding
activity. For purposes of thought, the simplest L-His RNA site contained a mean of 20.1 ISN [4], the
sufﬁcient L-Trp site about 18 ISN [29], and the simplest L-phenylalanine (Phe) site 17.5 ISN [4].
In 1 A260 of the above partially randomized RNA (with ﬂanking constant sequences), all
contiguous 24-mer sequences will likely be present [19]. Shorter chains of essential nucleotides
will be multiply present, and are more likely to be recovered. Thus, a simple summary is: the shortest
contiguous sequences, usually having ≤24 essential nucleotides, should be the most likely to be
isolated. These 24 “essential nucleotides” are deﬁned by statistics. If only purines occur at a given
position, this is twice as likely to occur as one speciﬁc nucleotide. In this case, selection can isolate
twice as many such “essential nucleotides”.
To put these ideas in another useful way, increasing the scale of an experiment by using 10-fold
more RNA usually provides access to 1.66 additional essential nucleotides [19]. Thus, there are two
kinds of selection experiments. One can do large experiments to seek large active motifs, but this
usually implies looking among sparsely sampled molecules, because not all sequences of long lengths
are present. Alternatively, one can look for smaller motifs, using RNA populations that contain many
copies of them. Such an experiment tests every possible sequence of shorter length for the selected
activity, which is often desirable. Increasing the amount of RNA moves the size boundary between
these two experimental goals, 1.66 nucleotides for every 10-fold in RNA. This quantitative argument
therefore also bears on the scope of small experiments. Because, typically, essential nucleotides ≤ ISN,
selection experiments of practical laboratory size, even small ones, easily recover RNAs with enough
ISN to fold functional amino acid binding sites.
2.2.2. Modularity

However, real RNA active sites are not usually made of the contiguous essential nucleotides
discussed above. An active internal loop, for example, may be composed of two active ‘single-stranded’
loop modules which combine to yield an active two-sided loop surrounded by helices—with little
regard to the initial spacing between the conserved loop modules. This is very important to real
tertiary structures because the more modules, and the more even their sizes, the more ways there are
to place them—thus the more frequently they occur within a randomized sequence [30]. Therefore,
being composed of many pieces, in the best case pieces of similar size, can also determine whether an
RNA structure can be isolated. Selections tend to isolate the most modular structures, as well as the
ones containing the fewest essential nucleotides [31].

The reasoning that makes modules helpful also suggests that space is similarly good. Longer
RNAs for selection should have more ways of, and be more capable of, manifesting a structure. To an
extent, this is true experimentally; up to ca. 60 randomized nucleotides, the Ile RNA binding site
becomes more frequent [20]. However, then in violating theory, it is less frequent in longer molecules.
Perhaps long RNAs go to Uhlenbeck’s alternative conformer hell [32].
2.2.3. Partially Conserved Nucleotides

Even nucleotides not usually deﬁned as conserved must be recruited to form an active site, like
those that form variable paired regions around a more conserved internal loop. These requirements
also reduce the frequency of sites, and can be subtle.
For example, complementary primer sequences reduce the frequency of the prevalent Ile-binding
site ca. 7.5-fold [20]. This effect can be traced to a displacement of site-bounding helices. The preexisting
constant helical structure favors one permutation of the Ile site, because one bounding helix is easier to
form from random sequences, thus also decreasing the accessible sequence space and total frequency
of the Ile motif.
Adding site-deﬁning stable helices to ﬂank active Ile loop modules decreases active site occurrence
by orders of magnitude [33]. The result is that about 4.1 × 109 100-mers or 0.2 nanograms or 7 femtomol
of RNA chains must be searched to ﬁnd the folded Ile-binding RNA. Judging from folding calculations,
inhibitory folding effects appear to be a much smaller impediment than effects of the rarity of these
bounding helical structures themselves. Nevertheless, these populations are orders smaller than the
usual laboratory selection experiment. They therefore suggest that an RNA world with amino acid
binding RNAs is more accessible than intuition at ﬁrst suggests.
2.2.4. Constant Promoter/Primers

The above Ile effect introduces the effects of ﬂanking sequences, which can become directly
or indirectly involved in the active sites. Such direct effects of constant sequences are easily
found. Flanking sequences can be incorporated as ISN, thereby changing the most likely site. The
incorporation of an AAA run from constant sequences completely changed the outcome of a selection
for Ile-binding sites [34], reducing the most frequent motif in any other selection to a minority.
Two-nucleotide constant tag sequences introduced for another reason led to isolation of a previously
unseen motif for D-His binding [35]. When the unique tags were not supplied, the novel site did not
appear at all in later selections.
As might be expected, the effects of constant sequences fade as the random region is lengthened,
and the selected site (for Ile; [20]), on average, moves away from constant inﬂuence. However, the
goal of coding experiments is to persuasively eliminate outside effects on the selection. This kind of
spurious effect can be eliminated by re-isolation of the same site in the context of different constant
sequences. For example, this has been done for the simplest Ile, His, and Trp-binding RNA motifs.
A more speciﬁc strategy, for coding studies, is to bar an amino acid’s codons and anticodons from
ﬁxed sequences (and thus bar them from inducing complements in selected sequences), as was done
for L-His [3,35].
Thus, a selection experiment also selects the constant sequences in the RNA transcript. Usually,
this is of no concern. However, in a rare case the end(s) of the RNA are crucial to activity, and the RNA
selected can change dramatically when a bounding sequence is changed or eliminated [36].
2.3. Sequentially Squeezed Selection

As this discussion shows, many factors alter the occurrence of a selected RNA sequence.
To simplify selection outcomes, and make them more easily interpretable, amino acid binding selections
have been conducted in random regions of decreasing size. For example, L-Ile binding was sought
within 26, 22, and 16 contiguous randomized nucleotides [25]. This size range is narrow enough to
avoid size selection based on slower replication of longer molecules [37]. Moreover, the experimental
106

MDPI Books

Life 2017, 7, 13

design accentuates two well-known beneﬁts. First, short RNA populations contain sequences, like the
Ile binding site, at frequencies close to calculated from probability, whereas long RNAs are deﬁcient [20].
Second, as pointed out above, short sequences can be fully represented in initial selection populations,
so that RNAs derived are plausibly the only functional ones existing at that size.
As we hoped, one Ile site sequence was prominent at larger lengths, the majority sequence with
selected activity at a shorter length, and then disappeared, leaving no bona ﬁde L-Ile-binding RNAs
at the shortest length. Thus, there is a predominant active structure, which persists as space for it is
shortened. Squeezing appears to establish a reliable limit—when selection requires more nucleotides
than randomized tracts provide, no shorter site is selected.
Related experiments apparently yield the simplest amino acid site for L-Ile [20,25], L-His [35],
L -Trp [28,29], and L -Arg [9]. This is not trivial in any case, but arginine is especially interesting.
L -Arg-RNA interactions are unusually strong and versatile (see above). Thus, numerous L -Arg sites
had been isolated. However, despite repeated selection, no L-Arg binding site had been observed more
than once. Nevertheless, under sequentially squeezed selection, a simplest L-Arg site emerged. Note
particularly that the shortest, simplest site in these experiments is required to be sidechain-speciﬁc
(otherwise an amino acid cannot be meaningfully encoded). Thus, a squeezed speciﬁc selection
probably focuses the site proﬁle toward sidechain features.
Moreover, study of two activities side-by-side allows investigation of which is the simpler RNA
function (takes place in the smaller site). Simultaneous mixed squeezed selection of afﬁnity for D-His
and L-His attached to a non-chiral glass support suggests that D-ribose RNA has an intrinsic chiral
preference. It folds the simplest site for L-His using about one less essential nucleotide than required
for the simplest D-His site [35]. The simplest L-His site was the same one [3] previously isolated
for L-His alone using a different column matrix, different ﬁxed sequences and solution conditions,
strengthening the argument for selection of simple sites. This same chiral L-His RNA site has been
taken through the looking glass, by synthesizing a Spiegelmer containing L-ribose rather than D-ribose.
Ruta, et al [38] conﬁrm that an enantiomeric switch in ribose also switches the RNA binding site to
favor D-His.
2.4. Reproducible Selections

I emphasize a general conclusion about amino acid afﬁnity selections. Within appropriate limits,
for example, attributable to the need for ﬁxed ﬂanking sequences that do not intrude, selections
have a predictable outcome. There are, reproducibly, simplest sites. The simplest L-Ile site has been
independently isolated 267 times [20]. Even for a versatile amino acid like L-Arg, which binds quite
variable, small ribonucleotide sequences—nonetheless a properly constrained search repeatedly ﬁnds
particular simple, recurring binding sites [9]. By extension, given predictable selection, evolution at
the amino acid-RNA level of complexity can be productively interrogated by experiments, and reliable
relations between amino acids and RNA sequences can be derived.
3. Amino Acid Binding Sites and Coding Triplets

We now consider one of those “reliable relations” in selected RNA-amino acid binding sites. What
follows (and what came before) is based on data for eight amino acids of varied chemical classiﬁcation
(Figure 1): charged polar (Arg+ , His+ ), uncharged polar (Tyr, Gln), aliphatic hydrophobes (Ile, Leu)
and aromatics (Phe, Trp). The survey is partial, but quite broad (Figure 2). There are 464 independently
derived sites in the characterized populations, Implicated Site Nucleotides number 7137, and total
nucleotides, inside and outside amino acid sites, are 21,938. Tested amino acids emerged from the
evolution of the code with six, three, two, and one triplet(s). Site sequences have been examined for
44 coding triplets altogether, 22 cognate codons and 22 cognate anticodons. The results surveyed are
those referenced earlier [1], updated for the sequentially squeezed selection for L-Arg [9].
Pcodon and Panticodon are probabilities that the associated coding triplets are equally frequent
outside each site and inside (within the ISN of) each site. That is, Figure 2 tabulates the probability that

107

MDPI Books

Life 2017, 7, 13

frequencies outside and inside are equal, by the G test—related to Chi-squared, but more versatile [39].
Equality is not the rule, as shown by probabilities with triple-digit negative exponents observed in
Figure 2. Instead, seven cognate anticodons and two codons are very signiﬁcantly elevated (marked by
shaded backgrounds for probabilities) in the ISN that are most closely connected to a bound amino acid.
The control is initially randomized nucleotides also in the selected RNAs, also selected using the same
procedures, but outside the ISN of the active binding site. Further, coding triplets in boldly outlined
white boxes in Figure 2 are the one codon and four anticodons concentrated in sequentially squeezed
selections for RNAs binding Trp [29], His [35], Ile [25], and Arg [9]. No amino acid site concentrates
codons alone; real cases either present both codons and anticodons (Arg, Ile) or anticodons alone
(His, Phe, Trp, Tyr). Notably, the positive results can be called sparse: only two of 12 Arg triplets are
signiﬁcantly implicated by selected sites, or two of six triplets for Ile. Other cases have found only
one triplet concentrated in RNA binding sites. Sparseness is a crucial ﬁnding, whose implications
reappear below.

Figure 2. Probability of uniform distribution of codon and anticodon triplets. Here the Implicated Site
Nucleotides (ISN) are compared with other initially randomized positions in individual selected amino
acid binding RNAs. Fixed sequences, of course, are not considered. Under the null hypothesis that
cognate triplets (listed in columns) are equally frequent inside and outside the ISN, the probabilities of
equal triplet distributions for eight kinds of amino acid sites are tabulated. Probabilities come from a
two-tailed G test with Williams correction [39]. Probability boxes containing dashes are triplets that
did not exist in the experimental sample. Among probabilities, shaded boxes with italicized numbers
are signiﬁcant. To evaluate signiﬁcance in a conservative way, I compute Psig = 1 − (1 − Perr )1/n where
Psig is the maximum acceptable probability and Perr is the target error for each of the n trials in the
Figure. To limit the probability of error to Perr = 0.01 in 44 individual trials, the maximum probability
regarded as signiﬁcant is Psig = 2.3 × 10−4 . Among triplets, italic triplets on white backgrounds are
those concentrated by sequential squeezed selections for the cognate amino acid. Binding and sequence
data can be found in: Ile [8,20,25], leucine (Leu) (I. Majerfeld, M. Illangasekare, M. Yarus, unpublished;
see [1], Gln (C. Scerch and G. Tocchini-Valentini, pers. comm; see [1]), Phe [40], Tyr [41], Trp [28,29],
His [3,35], Arg [9,22,26,42].

As an example, an arginine site is shown in Figure 3, where one of the most prevalent L-Arg
binding motifs is drawn. Gray circles mark Implicated Site Nucleotides. RNAs closely related to
this one, which bind L-Arg near the junction of a short helix and a highly-conserved 8-membered
hairpin loop (Figure 3), comprised 62% of all isolated RNAs. Related small sites conserve the L-Arg
anticodon marked at the entry to the hairpin loop (Figure 3) in 94% of all sequences. These motifs are
well-represented even when given only 17 initially randomized nucleotides to fold.

Figure 3. An example: the most prevalent Arg-binding RNA. Arg-606 [9], derived from a 25-nucleotide
randomized region, is shown. Lower-case letters are ﬁxed sequences, capital letters represent originally
randomized nucleotide positions. The nucleotide sequence is threaded through the probable secondary
structure for all related isolates, deduced by BayesFold [43]. Gray circles mark Implicated Site
Nucleotides, and the three open gray circles are a very highly conserved arginine anticodon (cognate
to codon AGG). Arg-606 had KD = 0.5 mM, and D/L ≈ 35, consistent with the idea that the smallest
sidechain-speciﬁc sites are predominantly single-ended. Comparable simplest His, Ile, and Trp sites
from separate sequentially squeezed selections have been reviewed [27].

4. Tiny Probabilities

Below, I argue that minute probabilities in Figure 2 are reliable guides—cognate coding triplets
are improbably elevated within RNA binding sites. These particular minute magnitudes are produced
by the experimental context. Sequentially squeezed selections generate many new, independently
derived binding sites. If a conserved cognate triplet appears in the simplest site, more sites with this
non-random outcome force the probability of an unbiased distribution progressively down. This is
evident in Figure 2, where the tiniest Pcodon and Panticodon are in white boxes associated with squeezed
selections. However, that being said, what of it? This behavior characterizes any true hypothesis.
The more experimental evidence, the less probable that we will contradict a true ﬁnding. Moreover,
Figure 2 contains cases like Phe and Tyr, where characterization of a few motifs from a normal selection
turn up an improbably concentrated cognate triplet. This was true for sequentially squeezed selections
also, before they were squeezed. Therefore, association of cognate triplets with RNA binding sites
does not depend on a special experiment—it was evident, in all cases, among initial examples isolated.
4.1. Observed Triplet Concentration Is Not Attributable to the Statistical Test

The test used in Figure 2 (G test for goodness of ﬁt with the Williams correction [39]) is related
to one universally used to test ratios in genetic crosses, and is therefore employed widely in Biology.
However, no test, nor any assumption whatever about the natural distribution of triplets within RNAs
is needed to reach the conclusion that the null hypothesis (triplets equivalent everywhere) is very
improbable. For L-Arg [9], nucleotide sequences of isolated RNAs were randomized 106 times, and
the resulting “binding sites” at previous positions were retested. The concentration of the Arg CCU
anticodon in real binding sites, for example (Figures 2 and 3), was not observed in a million such tries.

109

4.2. Triplet Concentrations Have the Logic of Real Coding: Reversed Triplets

MDPI Books

Life 2017, 7, 13

5 to 3 reversed codons (e.g., UUC Phe > CUU) and anticodons have the same compositions
and the same predicted random frequencies as true triplets. Such reversals would be concentrated in
binding sites by any accidental process. Moreover, if binding sites (or nonbinding sites) express an
underlying preference for certain nucleotides or triplet compositions, reversed triplets would succumb.
Thus, it is striking that, tested for multiple RNAs binding each of six amino acids, multiple observed
excesses of cognate triplets of both kinds vanish when tested triplets are reversed [44]. Because binding
sites contain several triplets (compare Figure 3), one might argue that at a signiﬁcant frequency, cognate
triplets will recur by chance. Evidently, this is rare, since reversed codons and anticodons do not
observably do so, given 42 triplets evaluated in 22 site sequences of six speciﬁcities.
4.3. Triplet Concentrations Have the Logic of Real Coding: Variation of the Code

Fifty million randomized codes have also been tested for triplet localization in experimental
binding sites [44]. Notably, 106 new codes were derived in ﬁve ways: with codons placed randomly in
the Coding Table, amino acids assigned randomly among real coding blocks, amino acid identities
assorted to blocks of the same size, randomization of triplet position 1 and 2, and reassignment of
initial codon doublets. In short, 99.2% to 99.5% of these randomized codes give less association with
observed binding sites than the real code, and those that do yield association tend to be those retaining
fragments of initial code structure. There are important positive and negative implications. Positively,
triplet excesses in experimental RNA binding sites are strongly associated with assignments made
during evolution of the bona ﬁde coding table. Negatively, these data are further strong evidence
against accidental links between triplets and cognate amino acids as a result of these procedures
(Figure 2).
4.4. Relation to Natural Cases

Remarkably, pooled experimental results in Figure 2 overlap evidence from natural RNA
sequences. The Tetrahymena self-splicing group I intron binds arginine [14], and guanidinium ion as an
analogue of the Arg side chain, using the G of a conserved Arg codon AGA/CGA/AGG [45]. Arg
guanidinium (terminus of the Arg side chain in Figure 1) emulates the base-pairing of G, so it can bind
at the same site [15,46]. Because this is within the active site for the co-splicing substrate, a guanosine
nucleotide, Arg and guanidinium inhibit splicing [14]. This behavior overlaps the concentration of
AGG triplets within newly selected RNA structures that bind Arg (Figure 2). Thus, the initial evidence
which initiated studies of amino acid-RNA binding is echoed in present selection results.
An even more surprising case appears in riboswitches regulated by guanidinium ion, in bacteria
that need to control its modiﬁcation and export [47]. Riboswitches regulate linked messages by
changing structure on binding metabolites. There are, for example, RNA riboswitch domains that bind
Gly [48], Lys [49], and Gln [50]. Such RNAs usually have complex structures and functions, and so are
not plausibly related to selected simplest amino acid sites.
However, guanidinium ion may be an exception. This small-molecule analogue of the Arg
side chain terminus (Figure 1) is bound within the conjunction of three conserved Arg codons,
AGA/CGG/CGG (Figure 4). Nucleotides of the three Arg codons are not only in close contact
with the ligand, but completely ﬁll the space around guanidinium and engage all of the polar groups
of the ion [51]. Using an adjacent G surface, this three-Arg-triplet site also includes close contact with
the top and bottom of the Arg side chain analog. The Tetrahymena site binds Arg [14], though for lack
of space, the Sulfobacillus site does not admit the complete amino acid [47]. However, both natural
examples display extreme concentration on the distal amino acid side chain of Arg, accompanied by
cognate coding triplets. Thus, sites in Tetrahymena rRNA and Sulfobacillus riboswitch aptamers suggest
that for Arg, the chemical connection between arginine/guanidinium afﬁnity and coding triplets has
found biological uses which persist into modern organisms. Such contemporary interactions may be

110

MDPI Books

Life 2017, 7, 13

much more frequent—anticodons in rRNA appear appreciably concentrated close to cognate amino
acid sidechains in four crystallographically deﬁned ribosomes [52].

Figure 4. Schematic structure of a Sulfobacillus guanidinium riboswitch. Gray numbered circles
are nucleotides of the crystallographic structure for guanidinium ion bound to the sensor of the
guanidinium-I riboswitch. Dotted lines are hydrogen bonds; the gray and black curved arrows indicate
that G72 covers the top, and G88 forms the bottom of the guanidinium binding site, respectively. Arg
triplet nucleotides are colored; the ones centered at G45 and G72 are almost completely conserved; at
G88, ≈75% conserved. G90 (black) is a non-triplet site nucleotide. Drawn from [51] and Protein Data
Base (PDB) structure 5T83.

It is unexpected that an amino acid afﬁnity puriﬁcation isolates RNA sequences that repeatedly
show a speciﬁc formal relation to the genetic code. Moreover, similar interactions for Arg appear in
natural RNAs. These data (Figures 2 and 3) are particularly interesting because squeezed sites, and
natural RNAs that emulate squeezed sites by concentrating on the terminus of a side chain, also elevate
the probability of essential coding triplets. In light of these repeated ﬁndings, there does not seem
to be a plausible alternative to the conclusion that RNA binding sites recapitulate an essential event
during the evolution of the amino acid code—but what event? Association of triplets and cognate sites
is itself objectively demonstrable. However, to reason about the foundational events of the genetic
code, a bit of speculation is required.
5. Direct RNA Templates (DRT)

The apparent simplest way to use these ﬁndings in primordial translation uses an RNA template
that directly binds (activated) amino acids side by side, so they subsequently react to form ordered,
encoded peptides. This emulates the mechanism of the ribosomal peptidyl transferase itself—it
accelerates its reaction principally by apposing reactants [53]. Cognate RNA triplets within amino acid
binding sites subsequently evolve to act as anticodons in tRNAs and codons in mRNAs [1]. In fact, the
potential co-occurrence of amino acid speciﬁcity, anticodons, and codons together in one RNA binding
site is an intrinsically striking property. RNAs studded with multiple aminoacyl-RNA synthesis centers
at a potential mean spacing of only a few nucleotides are also well known [54], and similar aminoacyl
transfer centers can be supplied with activated amino acids by a ribozyme [55,56]. These data together
make possible RNA encoded peptide synthesis resident in one small RNA complex. The advantages
of DRT simplicity have been argued before [1], though there are other possibilities [57].
Because we were interested in the molecular constraints on a DRT, we selected RNAs that bind [4]
two amino acids in peptide linkage, NH2 -His-Phe-COOH, retaining speciﬁcity for both side chains. His
and Phe were used because their binding as free amino acids was already understood (see references,

111

MDPI Books

Life 2017, 7, 13

Figure 2). This experiment required counterselection against afﬁnity for His and Phe individually,
because singly-directed sites require fewer nucleotides. Thus, afﬁnity for a single side chain (usually
protonated His, Figure 1) is selected preferentially. When the census of ISN is taken on these sequenced
and characterized His-Phe RNAs, His sites required 20.1 ISN, Phe 17.5 ISN, and His-Phe 24.4 ISN
(averaging all RNAs in the two prevalent motifs for the latter). As an example, RNA 16 has KD = 90 μM
for His-Phe, 13 mM for L-His, and 100 mM for L-Phe. Thus, a peptide-binding RNA, even one that
contacts both side chains, is not the sum of two amino acid afﬁnities. Instead, the peptide site is only
≈35% larger than a site for one amino acid. Consistent with these counts, neither the previously known
His site, nor the known Phe site, appear in these selected His-Phe RNAs. A new dual, smaller site is
selected instead. An example of the most frequent His-Phe site is shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5. RNA 8, which has afﬁnity for His and Phe in His-Phe. Lower case letters are ﬁxed sequences,
capital letters are initially randomized positions [4]. The RNA is threaded through the most probable
secondary structure computed for its independent isolates by BayesFold [43]. Gray circles mark
Implicated Site Nucleotides; those with white centers are potential coding triplets labeled “Phe ac”
(ac = anticodon) and “His ac”. Green nucleotides are non-site, but initially randomized nucleotides.

A ready rationale exists for smaller individual amino acid sites, still side chain speciﬁc. These
can be extreme single-ended sites (see above), forced to be small because of the crowding of two sites
produced by the short single covalent peptide bond between His and Phe. To be consistent, this kind of
L-His site was not produced by sequential squeezed selection [35], so its structure must depend on the
adjacent Phe residue or site. The existence of this kind of molecule supports the DRT, because it shows
that RNA that binds DRT substrates (which are like free amino acids) can also bind the peptide product
(His-Phe). Thus, for catalysis, only the binding of the transition state for peptide bond formation has
not been shown, and this predicted activity can now be subjected to experimental search.
However, support for a DRT from this work has another, more surprising dimension. The
sequence of the ISN for His-Phe RNA (Figure 5) contains adjacent His and Phe anticodons (white
centers, Figure 5). Further, these are the same triplets over-represented in newly selected separate His
and Phe binding sites (Figure 2). In this experiment, we do not have the statistical power (Figure 2) or
structural resolution (Figure 4) of the general investigation of amino acid sites, whose interpretation
presently relies on almost 100-fold more sites than for His-Phe peptide. Thus, caution is appropriate.
Nevertheless, anticodon triplets (Figure 5) are noticeably conserved. There are seven independent
parental molecules (12 isolates) of the His-Phe RNA shown. Three of seven have the Phe anticodon
shown, two of those also have the adjacent His anticodon [4].

112

MDPI Books

Life 2017, 7, 13

It would be unexpected to discover a new series of amino acid sites connected to the genetic
code, in peptide binding sites. So, it is probably not a new set of sites, but simply a more radically
squeezed structure. In other words, a partial site, not stable without the adjacent amino acid, but
containing the same cognate anticodon as in the free amino acid site (Figure 2). This idea merits further
investigation. Meanwhile, speciﬁc His-Phe peptide afﬁnity, accompanied by individual sidechain
contacts and cognate anticodons, are remarkably consistent with a primordial DRT.
6. The Origin of the Genetic Code Is a Puzzle Whose Pieces Fit Together

Two other major accounts of the code’s history, co-evolution [58], and adaptation [59], also
have major roles to play. These roles are, in fact, now explicitly deﬁned by data in Figure 2, in the
following sense.
Co-evolution is the idea that an early code ceded codons to later amino acids or acquired unused
codons, as biochemical pathways extended the amino acid repertoire. This idea can be analyzed
by comparing the coding table to biosynthetic pathways [60]. Adaptation theories propose that the
code was created by optimization, most explicitly by reducing errors created by mistranslation [61].
Adaptation can be supported by showing resemblance between the genetic code’s order and an
optimized arrangement on the basis of similar amino acid chemical properties [62].
Both co-evolution and adaptation require a pre-existing code. There must be coding to be
extended as biosynthesis advances. There must be coding to be optimized by adaptation. Therefore,
both hypotheses require something like the stereochemically-deﬁned core suggested by RNA binding
data (Figure 2). In one sense, this pre-existing stereochemical core is likely to be substantial. Six of eight
arbitrarily characterized amino acids (Figure 4) concentrate their anticodons in the ISN of binding sites
selected from random RNA sequences. Thus, excepting Gln and Leu, traces of a canonical core are
observed for 75% of amino acids surveyed.
6.1. The Nature of the Stereochemical Basis

However, 75% overstates the results in an important way. As pointed out above, coverage of
the 48 possible triplets in binding sites is sparse. Arg is the high extreme: one of its six codons, and
two of six anticodons are implicated by selection results (Figures 2 and 3). If one adds the group I
self-splicing RNA [45], the count rises to three Arg codons and two anticodons. Provisionally adding
the guanidinium speciﬁc riboswitch site yields one new codon [51]. Thus, this extensive dataset yields
associations with six of 12 possible Arg triplets. Moreover, in the more complete survey (Figure 2)
of eight amino acids, 12 of 48 possible associations have been detected. As Arg surely illustrates, we
can be surprised by new data. However, it is more plausible that exacting chemical requirements for
participation in a speciﬁc RNA binding site’s tertiary structure can only be satisﬁed by a few cognate
triplets, of all those available. The ﬁnal result might be estimated close to the current average for eight
amino acids, 25%, and less than the maximum 50% of triplets for Arg, the most RNA-accessible amino
acid. That is: given present accounting (Figures 2–5), the majority of triplets may have entered the
code another way, rather than via RNA-amino acid speciﬁcity.
6.2. Co-Evolution Is Needed to Reach Barren Areas

This reasoning implies a role for co-evolution and adaptation. How might one extend coding
to triplets not touched by amino acid sites, like those for Gln (Figure 2)? A clear possibility is: one
can co-evolve to adopt them. In fact, it has been suggested [63] that the existence of Glu-tRNAGln ,
a modern metabolite and possible co-evolutionary intermediate in the incorporation of the Gln codons,
is strong support for co-evolution to Gln coding. This Glu-tRNAGln argument also complements
negative RNA binding evidence for Gln triplets from selection (Figure 2).

113

6.3. Adaptation Is Needed to Fill Boxes

MDPI Books

Life 2017, 7, 13

As for adaptation: how might one ﬁll in the six kinds of partially occupied coding boxes sparsely
created by RNA afﬁnities (Figure 2)? The logic of RNA binding sites has no apparent reason to respect
the neat groups of six or four or three or two triplets so characteristic of the code. However, this is
easily rationalized as the result of a process which minimized the effect of translational ambiguity
by evolving to use sets of related triplets. In fact, it can be shown that even levels of pre-existing
stereochemical assignment we have found still allow resulting codes to be optimized [64]. There is no
logical inconsistency in believing both stereochemistry and adaptation were inﬂuential in code history.
7. Conclusions

We decisively conﬁrm the hypothesis in this review’s ﬁrst paragraph. The RNA-amino acid
interface does contain the logic of (some of) the genetic code, relating triplets to amino acid side chains.
Cognate triplets, though their functions may vary, are unexpectedly close to their amino acids. The
conclusion is unequivocal—the probability that the contrary is true hovers in negative exponential
triple digits (Figures 2–5). These data together strongly conﬁrm intuitions of Crick [65], Orgel [66], and
Woese [62], who thought that such a connection would exist.
It is presently less clear how to incorporate this ﬁnding into the code’s history, but early data on
a Direct RNA Template are very positive (Figure 5). Among the most probable His-Phe RNAs are
frequent molecules contacting both amino acid side chains, held at a spacing appropriate to peptide
synthesis, and containing both cognate His and Phe anticodons.
Accordingly, events attending the birth of the genetic code are still remarkably evident in modern
RNAs and amino acids. This implies that modern molecules are very similar to their ancestors. This is
consistent with the tree of life on Earth [67], which shows that the code and translation are virtually
universal, so their molecules trace back at least to the Last Common Ancestor [68]. In the experiments
above, we show that these agents are older yet, likely surviving from the ﬁrst encoded ancestral
peptides. This is crucial data; modern biochemicals are tacitly assumed relevant in many studies of
molecular evolution.
Finally, though study of the route to the full code is just beginning, several strong constraints
have empirical support (Figure 2). Despite persuasive evidence for cognate triplets in RNA binding
sites, neither the resulting stereochemistry, nor adaptation, nor co-evolution are plausibly sufﬁcient to
create the entire code, acting alone. Stereochemical afﬁnities are uniquely capable of initiating coding,
but extension of such initial assignments via co-evolution and adaptation are probably essential to
complete the modern coding table.

Abstract: The frozen accident theory of the Genetic Code was a proposal by Francis Crick that
attempted to explain the universal nature of the Genetic Code and the fact that it only contains
information for twenty amino acids. Fifty years later, it is clear that variations to the universal Genetic
Code exist in nature and that translation is not limited to twenty amino acids. However, given the
astonishing diversity of life on earth, and the extended evolutionary time that has taken place since
the emergence of the extant Genetic Code, the idea that the translation apparatus is for the most part
immobile remains true. Here, we will offer a potential explanation to the reason why the code has
remained mostly stable for over three billion years, and discuss some of the mechanisms that allow
species to overcome the intrinsic functional limitations of the protein synthesis machinery.
Keywords: translation; evolution; speciation; protein folds; tRNA; ribosome

1. The Limits of the Genetic Code

The race to identify the structure of the Genetic Code was intense. However, the literature of the
time suggests that it was, nevertheless, a collaborative exercise enriched by an intense academic debate
that tried to offer explanations to the many questions that kept popping up.
In his seminal paper ‘The origin of the Genetic Code’, Francis Harry Compton Crick offered
a good example of this dynamic as he and Leslie Orgel published their respective views on this topic
in back-to-back papers [1,2]. In his paper Crick used the term ‘frozen accident’ to refer to the apparent
inability of the code to accept new variations, and he contrasted this hypothesis with an alternative
possibility: the stereochemical theory for the origin of the Genetic Code.
In the forty-nine years that have passed since the publication of this paper, we have advanced
very signiﬁcantly in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern the Genetic Code.
However, many fundamental questions regarding the origin and evolution of the code remain open,
and chief among them is the reason why the system stopped incorporating new amino acids despite
the obvious availability of codon sequences.
Nevertheless, progress has been made. The remarkable advances in the structural analysis of
ribosomes, tRNAs, and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARS) have led to several important conclusions
regarding the central roles of RNA in the early Genetic Code, which persist today in the functions
of transfer RNAs and the ribosome, among others [3–5]. We now have strong support for the
notion that extant proteomes functionally replaced a preceding RNA world where most, if not all,
biological catalysis was performed by RNA molecules [6].
It is generally accepted that a primitive Genetic Code, using a limited number of amino acids or
groups of related amino acids under a single identity, expanded through the generation of new tRNA

Life 2017, 7, 14

identities that increased the number of residues being used, while allowing for a better discrimination
between similar amino acid sidechains [7]. The remarkable clustering of chemically-related amino
acids that can be seen in the Genetic Code possibly reﬂects the process of establishment of the different
codon and tRNA identities, and is the basis for the coevolution theory of Wong [8,9].
It is reasonable to expect that the expansion of tRNA identities was accompanied by the evolution
of tRNA-associated polypeptides (ancestors of extant ARS). Indeed, both the distribution of amino
acids in the Genetic Code, as well as the structural features of tRNA, are closely mirrored by the
organization of the two ARS classes [10].
It is possible that the initial interaction between primitive tRNAs and the ancestral forms of ARS
was in a complex of tRNA molecules bound by a heterodimer from which the two families of ARS later
would emerge [11]. It has also been proposed that these two ancestral ARS domains could be coded
by complementary strands and, as such, be under tightly coupled selection [12]. This hypothesis can
explain the broad internal organization of the two ARS classes, the intriguing distribution of amino
acid speciﬁcities that can be seen within these same classes, and the many unexplained similarities in
identity elements found between tRNAs that are aminoacylated by ARS of different classes [13,14].
2. Why Did the Genetic Code Freeze?

Given the extraordinary chemical diversity of biological amino acids, and the potential for
a three-base code based on four bases to theoretically incorporate up to sixty-three amino acids, it is
a priori unclear why the universal Genetic Code includes only twenty amino acids. This is even more
puzzling if one considers that several additional amino acids, such as selenocysteine and pyrrolysine,
are used for protein synthesis. Chemical modiﬁcations of side chains are widespread, suggesting that
cells could use a larger repertoire of residues within the canonical Genetic Code. Thus, what drove the
arrest in the emergence of new tRNA identities and the expansion of the Genetic Code?
Although faithful amino acid recognition is an essential feature of the Genetic Code, it is unlikely
that it was a limiting factor in the growth of the system because the recognition is limited to the
interactions with ARS active sites, which are extremely adaptable and supported by editing domains
that can discriminate between similar side chains [15]. On the other hand, the recognition of tRNAs
is a much harder challenge because the three-dimensional structures of all tRNAs are very similar,
their chemical composition before modiﬁcations is more uniform, and the number of required speciﬁc
interactions with protein components of the translation apparatus is much larger.
We have proposed that a functional boundary exists with regards to the ability of the translation
apparatus to successfully discriminate different tRNA identities. This boundary is determined by the
overall capacity of the tRNA structure to incorporate different recognition elements. The incorporation
of a new amino acid (hence a new tRNA identity) greatly increases the combinatorial problem faced
by the translation machinery to speciﬁcally recognize individual tRNAs. This problem applies to
modiﬁcation enzymes, transport systems, ARS, elongation factors, ribosomes, etc. All tRNA identity
elements need to coexist in a short RNA sequence whose structure is necessarily similar among all
tRNAs in the cell. Additional constraints on tRNA evolution emerging from its non-canonical functions
can also be envisaged. Our proposal is that this complex recognition network reaches a limit beyond
which the incorporation of new tRNA identities is impossible without generating a recognition conﬂict
with a pre-existing tRNA [16].
We have demonstrated that the saturation of structural and identity signals in a tRNA can prevent
this molecule from incorporating other identities in evolution. We investigated the reasons for the
intriguing lack of tRNAGly ACC in eukaryotic genomes and showed that pre-existing features of the
tRNAGly anticodon loop are incompatible with the presence of an adenosine at position 34, explaining
why an A34-containing tRNA could not evolve and become enriched in eukaryotes [16].
At the genomic level, we observed that species with low numbers of tRNA genes have signiﬁcantly
more nucleotide differences between their orthologous tRNA pairs than closely related species with
a larger number of tRNA genes. This is consistent with the notion that an increase in complexity

119

MDPI Books

of tRNA populations leads to a higher conservation of tRNA sequences. Conversely, it would be
expected that tRNA sequences would evolve faster in genomes with smaller numbers of tRNA genes.
This situation is evident, for example, in mitochondria whose genomes have low numbers of tRNA
genes [17]. Mitochondrial genomes display abundant deviations from the canonical Genetic Code,
and contain the highest known variability in the structure and identity elements of tRNAs [18–20].
3. Evolutionary Strategies to Expand the Functional Boundaries of the Translation Apparatus

The study of globular protein folds has shown that the extant universe of proteins covers a minimal
area of the vast potential number of protein structures. It is likely that extant protein structures evolved
from the repetition of simpler domains that were assembled gradually through mechanisms of genetic
recombination [21,22].
The synthesis of proteins generated through multiple repetitions of simple sequences may
encounter difﬁculties due to the physicochemical characteristics of such repetitive peptides, or to the
inability of tRNAs to maintain ﬁdelity and reading frame when low complexity mRNA sequences
are encountered. A number of adaptations have emerged to overcome some of these limitations.
For example, the structure of the mammalian mitochondrial ribosome reveals that its polypeptide exit
channel has been remodeled to allow not only the synthesis of the hydrophobic proteins that constitute
the mitochondrial respiratory chain, but also their insertion into the mitochondrial membrane [23].
Also, EF-P (or eIF5A in eukaryotes), is a universally distributed elongation factor required for the
translation of stretches of poly-proline codons [24]. Finally, translation of the extremely codon-biased
mRNA transcripts coding for sericin and ﬁbroin (protein components of silk) in the salivary glands of
some arthropods requires a unique and highly skewed pool of cellular tRNAs, speciﬁcally selected
to favor the translation of these mRNAs [25,26]. Thus, certain sequence combinations are a priori
inaccessible to the translation apparatus, and functional improvements are needed to translate them.
The existence of species-speciﬁc adaptations of the translation apparatus indicate that some species
have access to protein structures that are inaccessible to others [27]. We envisage that adaptations
of the protein synthesis apparatus that allowed a given species to assemble new types of proteins
would provide these organisms with the opportunity to evolve novel and unique functions (in the
aforementioned example, the production of silk resulted in a novel mechanism for the growth and
development of certain arthropods). We believe that this evolutionary process could start with a simple
modiﬁcation of the translation apparatus, which would allow species to increase their proteome
diversity and drive speciation in a punctuated manner (Figure 1A).
Two important parameters that differentiate the translation apparatuses of the three domains
of life are their genomic composition of tRNA genes and the set of base modiﬁcations in their
mature tRNAs [28,29]. We have shown that the divergence of eukaryotic and bacterial genomes
in terms of tRNA composition is tightly linked to the evolution of different base modiﬁcations
in the two kingdoms [30]. In eukaryotic genomes, a remarkable enrichment in genes coding
for A34-containing tRNA isoacceptors coincided with the appearance of heterodimeric adenosine
deaminases acting on tRNAs (ADAT). This enzyme deaminates A34 to inosine (I34) in tRNAs decoding
for eight different amino acids [31]. The activity of this enzyme allows the tRNA pool in eukaryotic
cells to match the codon composition of their genomes [30].
In the human transcriptome, codons recognized by ADAT-modiﬁed tRNAs are signiﬁcantly more
abundant than those that do not require these modiﬁed tRNAs, and this preference is greater in proteins
that are highly enriched in the eight amino acids that can be decoded by ADAT-modiﬁed tRNAs.
We have shown that, in the human proteome, the polypeptides that display the highest preference for
these ADAT-modiﬁed tRNAs contain extremely biased stretches of the amino acids threonine, alanine,
proline, and serine (TAPS) [32]. Figure 1B shows an example of such proteins, Syndecan 3 (SDC3),
a member of a proteoglycan family unique to placentals (Figure 1C). This observation suggests that
the emergence of TAPS-enriched proteins in eukaryotes was facilitated by the evolutionary emergence
of ADAT, which caused an ‘upgrade’ of the translation machinery through the modiﬁcation of the

composition and the codon-pairing capacity of their tRNA pool. We propose that the capacity of
bacterial- and archaeal-type translation machineries to synthesize polypeptides highly enriched in
TAPS, is limited by the functional characteristics of their tRNA pools, which may be either inefﬁcient
during the elongation phase of these transcripts (causing ribosomal stalling), or prone to decoding
errors in these circumstances (causing deleterious levels of mutations in the resulting polypeptides).

Figure 1. Translation upgrades may lead to novel protein structures and drive speciation.
(A) The translation machinery is capable of synthesizing a ﬁnite number of standard protein structures,
and translation ‘upgrades’ (red asterisks) such as codon usage adaptations, or modulation of the
tRNA pool, allow the translation machinery to synthesize proteins with novel structures and functions.
This process may drive speciation; (B) An example of a gene (SDC3) containing a region with a sequence
highly enriched in ADAT-related amino acids (red dashed line; upper panel). The codon composition
of the DNA coding for this domain is highly biased towards triplets recognized by tRNAs modiﬁed
by ADAT. The lower panel shows the enrichment in ADAT-related amino acids (yellow line) and
ADAT-dependent codons (red line) across the whole sequence of SDC3. The dashed line marks
an enrichment level of ADAT-dependent codons of 80%; (C) Consensus phylogeny for Vertebrata.
SDC3 belongs to the syndecan proteoglycan family found solely in placentals (highlighted region).
The activity of ADAT may have contributed to the emergence of SDC3-type domains in placentals.

The number of known species-speciﬁc features of the translation apparatus continues to grow
and already includes the composition and regulation of several tRNA modiﬁcations, alterations to
the ribosomal structure, the differential functionality of translation factors, and the protein and RNA
composition of ribosomes, among others. Some of these adaptations may have resulted in translation
machinery upgrades that allowed the synthesis of proteins with novel structures and functionality.

The extent to which each of these differential features contributed to the divergence of proteomes is still
unknown. However, a comparative analysis of the regions of the protein universe that are occupied by
the proteomes of archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryotic organisms could shed light on this question.
In conclusion, the frozen accident that Francis Crick proposed with his characteristic genius may
have been the result of the intrinsic limitations imposed by tRNA recognition, but translation has
learned to overcome some of these initial limitations through additional functional adaptations that
allow species to increase the range and roles of their proteins.

Abstract: The proposal that the genetic code was formed on the basis of (proto)tRNA Dimer-Directed
Protein Synthesis is reviewed and updated. The tRNAs paired through the anticodon loops are an
indication on the process. Dimers are considered mimics of the ribosomes—structures that hold
tRNAs together and facilitate the transferase reaction, and of the translation process—anticodons are
at the same time codons for each other. The primitive protein synthesis system gets stabilized when
the product peptides are stable and apt to bind the producers therewith establishing a self-stimulating
production cycle. The chronology of amino acid encoding starts with Glycine and Serine, indicating
the metabolic support of the Glycine-Serine C1-assimilation pathway, which is also consistent with
evidence on origins of bioenergetics mechanisms. Since it is not possible to reach for substrates
simpler than C1 and compounds in the identiﬁed pathway are apt for generating the other central
metabolic routes, it is considered that protein synthesis is the beginning and center of a succession
of sink-effective mechanisms that drive the formation and evolution of the metabolic ﬂow system.
Plasticity and diversiﬁcation of proteins construct the cellular system following the orientation
given by the ﬂow and implementing it. Nucleic acid monomers participate in bioenergetics and the
polymers are conservative memory systems for the synthesis of proteins. Protoplasmic ﬁssion is the
ﬁnal sink-effective mechanism, part of cell reproduction, guaranteeing that proteins don’t accumulate
to saturation, which would trigger inhibition.

Living beings are metabolic ﬂow systems that self-construct on the basis of memories and
adapt/evolve on the basis of constitutive plasticity.

Life is the ontogenetic and evolutionary process instantiated by living beings.
1. Context

Cellular structures and functions are composed by a network that may be divided into a mostly
internal segment of macromolecules, the proteins and the nucleic acids, and another of micromolecules,
that communicate and exchange intimately with the environment. The genetic encoding/decoding
system is a key mechanism in both of these processes. It participates in the informational, the polymer
sequence order-based self-referential cycle that is the cellular nucleoprotein core, the speciﬁcally
endogenous and molecular identiﬁer of living beings (Figure 1). The decoding system mediates the
translation of genetic sequences—string memories—into proteins, which are the main functional
working components of the cell system. The protein synthesis machinery is centered on ribosomes,
while the mRNAs, tRNAs and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aRS) carry the translation triplet codes,
which establish the correspondences between mRNA and tRNA base triplets and the amino acids.

It may be said, with some simpliﬁcation, that the main function of the other—inter-genic—sequences
and of the multitude of RNAs that do not code for proteins would be regulatory, in the sense of
retrieving information, processing and preparing protein-coding sequences for coordinated expression
in the adequate time and space contexts [1]. There are ribozyme activities in different parts of the
system, its main representative being possibly the ribosomal Peptidyl Transferase Center [2,3]. It could
be said that the main catalytic function in the RNP complexes would reside in enzymes, while proteins
and RNAs together help and guide each other to identify targets and substrates with precision.

Figure 1. Fundamentals of living beings. Cellular functions are described as composed by two
interconnected and interdependent self-referential cycles. The informational cycle is composed by the
system where proteins and nucleic acids generate each other and are connected through the genetic
code and the nucleic acid-binding proteins. The plasticity function, which is mainly of proteins and
networks, is responsible for propulsion of the system through adaptations and evolution. The memory
in strings and the replication function of nucleic acids is responsible for stability and identity that are
conservation properties. The metabolism cycle is continuous with the environment that is transformed
via uptake of resources and extrusion of waste. The cycles conﬁgure a ﬂow system that is centered
on the initial sink of protein synthesis. This is kept continually active through the addition of various
other sink mechanisms, culminating in the extrusion of cytoplasmic chunks which gave origin to
reproduction. Cycles are drawn with dashed lines indicating their limited regenerative capacity and
duration, and dependence on contexts.

The other portion of this cycle relies upon activities of the nucleic acid-binding oligomeric segments
of proteins. These are involved with stabilization of the genetic molecules and the regulation of their
activities through formation of nucleoprotein complexes. A useful metaphor for the self-referential
aspect of the system would be of a producer-product ensemble that can only work efﬁciently and
along the time, when the products—proteins—are able to recognize and feedback positively upon
the producers—RNA, DNA. In case such informational closure would not be effective, the producers
would eventually stop acting in those directions which only resulted in wasted investment, and may
attempt functions in other directions that could accomplish the self-stimulating process. It is assumed
that such processes occurred in the proto-biotic realm of events, involving oligomers, and led to the
encodings. They are akin to autocatalysis [4], but differ from those by the composition of distinct
agents that integrate among themselves to form a system.

In the genetic encoding process, the initial recognition of the two components—tRNA and amino
acid, that is mediated by the enzyme aRS—could simply involve the binding of the protein, product
of the proto-, pre-(t)RNA dimer, to this, which is the producer, and the result is the formation of
an ensemble that is stabilized (Figure 2B). Stabilization per se has a (self)stimulatory effect upon the
system. The stabilized couple would evolve into a aRS-tRNA cognate set given that (1) this initial
binding would at least not harm the protein synthesis activity and in case (2) the speciﬁcity would
show beneﬁts to the chemical system in which they are immersed, starting with e.g., facilitation of the
ﬂows through reduction of turbulence and of mass and energy gradients, among other effects. The two
components of this cycle produce the compositional (various recognition sites in the enzyme and in
the tRNA) to discrete (one triplet—the anticodon—and one amino acid) correspondences and also the
self-stimulatory properties that are at the core of the living systems [5,6].

Figure 2. Protein synthesis directed by tRNA couples at ribosomal translation and directed by dimers of
(proto)tRNAs. (A) Ribosomal translation of mRNA is made by couples of tRNAs whose tails, carrying
an amino acid or a peptide, are placed in contact that facilitates formation of a peptide bond. Successive
couples scan the mRNA from the 5 to the 3 termini that correspond to the protein N-end and C-ends,
respectively. There are two cycles of the substrates that are fed by the aRSs. A tRNA receives an amino
acid and the aminoacyl-tRNA enters the ribosomal acceptor A-site. This receives the transfer, from
the P-site, of the initiator Methionine or of the nascent peptide and a peptide bond is made by the
transferase activity (green arrow) at the ribosomal Peptidyl Transferase Center. The ribosome moves
forward while the A-site tRNA with the n + 1 peptidyl tail is translocated to the P-site, which releases
its empty tRNA that may be later re-charged. The amino acids (red elipses) derive from uptake or are
recycled from protein degradation and are polymerized into proteins. These may participate in the
translation system, therewith establishing a self-stimulating process (the aRSs are examples of such
class of proteins) or may be released to build other structures and functions; (B) The self-referential
model proposes that the encoding process derives from Dimer-Directed Protein Synthesis, which
mimics the tRNA couples of the translation process. The anticodons are at the same time codons for
each other and the dimer structure would also be a proto-ribosome, holding two tRNAs together and
facilitating the transferase reaction. The tRNAs composing the dimers and the direction of the reaction
could, in principle, vary along iterations of the process. Encoding would result from the binding and
stabilization of the dimer structures by selected kinds of peptides produced, adequate also for keeping
their functions; (C) A dimer of uncharged tRNAs observed experimentally [7], which survived drastic
puriﬁcation processes. The acceptor tails are far apart. The anticodons are held together in spite of the
GUC
central base mismatch, due to the self-complementariness of the Asp anticodons CUG

Another self-referential cycle couples with these endogenous, uniquely cellular identity structures
and establishes (hetero-referential) relations with the environment. The two cycles together comprise
the deﬁnition of the cell (the living being) as a metabolic ﬂow system. The relational cycle is composed
by elements of the nucleoprotein system—enzymes, ribozymes, and its products or subcomponents,
such as cofactors and carriers—and is devoted to its maintenance. The scheme of the cell is fully
self-referential. The ‘auto or self’ aspect relies upon memories, guaranteeing the maintenance of
identity, conservation and stability. They are of two kinds: the replicative, stored in genetic strings [8]
plus the systemic, dynamically conserved in positive feedback cycles that are constructed with the
products [9]. Functions are of proteins and networks, highly plastic and diversiﬁed, whose restlessness
and constructiveness propel and drive adaptations and evolution [10–12], in concert with the metabolic
ﬂow directionality. Both also contribute to the metabolic sink effectiveness.
The setting for the origins of cells inside geochemical systems (discussion in [13,14]) considers
plain continuity between the universal ﬂow where the sink is almost virtual, that is, the entropic
direction given by thermodynamic degradation, which becomes real in its application to matter, where
the degradative processes are energetic and material, that is, molecular. In living beings, the sink is
ﬁrst identiﬁed in the consumption of amino acids at the protein synthesis system, which also involves
the genetic memories. A schema of the steps would be as follows. There is (a) a push to keep the
metabolic ﬂow going, driven by the gradients of concentrations of amino acids and energy, among
other organics, which is relieved and at the same time reinforced by creating the (b) protein synthesis
sink (pulling), and this is kept continuously active by the (c) constitutive plasticity of the components,
especially the proteins, which add diversiﬁcation of kinds and (d) efﬁciency through the development
of speciﬁcity, which may be identiﬁed with the genetic code.
The sketch in Figure 1 considers the molecular bases of the cell systems, which are the constitutive
grounds or bottom layers of the living—metabolic ﬂow systems that self-construct through memories
and adapt/evolve through plasticity. It is expected that this deﬁnition would be useful to accommodate
other aspects of the life process—the entire set of activities (from ontogenesis to evolution) instantiated
by living beings—as evolutionary additions to the basic biomolecular. The constitutive functions in
the terrestrial life process are: propulsion through the plasticity properties, which is most extensive in
proteins, second in RNA and less in DNA, and conservation through the replication properties of the
string memory structures, especially DNA. The other propulsion subsystem is the directional metabolic
ﬂow, which is also morphogenetic and coupled concertedly with the informational subsystem. This
self-referential or cyclical panorama [15] is at the basis of the model for the genetic code structure that
is based on encoding directed by dimers of tRNAs (Figure 2). The bi-functional ensemble, combining
propulsion/innovation/change (that are mostly in proteins) with conservation/identity/stability
(mostly in replication of nucleic acids) is a basic attribute of life in general; the application of this
‘balance in mutuality’ to human affairs might consider it a source of tension and possible conﬂicts.
The intermingled structure of the system also means that all components are involved with the
formation of a network where it is difﬁcult to establish linear chronologies for sectors of the system.
The main paradigm becomes of fully integrated coevolution [16]. When an amino acid is in the process
of being encoded its availability should be guaranteed, which means that its production pathway
should also be at least in the process of being ﬁxed, as well as those routes of its utilization by the cell,
and all aspects should ﬁt each other for general shared beneﬁts.
Some selected aspects of the model are recalled to compose this review, without much focus on
technical details but attempting to encourage the reader to examine the original papers and to submit
the model to further tests. It has survived already some empirical checks. We will concentrate in a few
key references from which others can be reached [17].
2. Modular Structure in the Genetic Code and Layout of the Text

Study of the structure and formation of the genetic code has to concentrate on its elements—tRNAs
with their anticodon triplets, amino acids and aRSs—that are independently moving in the cellular

127

ﬂuids and have to compose and aggregate for generation of function (e.g., [18,19]). We will not treat
much of the work based on codons in mRNAs and genes. These are strings of triplets adjusted for
translation speed, where much of the characters that were important for the encoding process do not
have speciﬁc functions anymore and are not manifest in the string context. The regularities in the
matrix of anticodes that indicate a structure based on dimers or pairs are here sometimes introduced
in a simpliﬁed mode, through utilization of the ‘principal dinucleotides (pDiN) + wobble’ structure of the
triplets, which is established by the aRSs and identify the 16 boxes; the wobble position may not be
speciﬁed, becoming N. Some data are available only for dinucleotides, e.g., the hydropathies, due to
low solubility of the triplets that limit the chromatographic experiments [20]. The simpliﬁcation of
triplets to doublets of bases is informative enough for some comparisons. The 16 boxes are organized
through the formation of dimers in four modules, each with two pairs of boxes (Table 1).
Table 1. Structure of the anticode organized through modules of dimers and the chronology of
encoding. The two sectors and four modules are identiﬁed by the principal dinucleotides. The principal
dinucleotides also dictate the pairing possibilities. (A) Bases in the 5 position (wobble) are chosen
among the variety (indicated by N), according to the generic complementariness R:Y, which is dictated
by the base in the 3 position. The central base pair is strictly of the Watson:Crick type, A:U, G:C.
(B) Amino acids of the Glutamate family are in bold, in the homogeneous sector plus the Arg that
expands into the mixed sector; Phenylalanine is the ﬁrst amino acid encoded that derives from sugar
precursors, also bold. Lysine biosynthesis has pathways derived from Asp or Glu. Punctuation is
indicated to form after the elongation amino acid encodings; its three codes are in blue to indicate their
mechanistic relatedness. Further details on the chronology will be shown later in the text.

The results that compose the Self-Referential Model (SRM) for the structure and the formation of
the genetic code are summarized as follows. Dimers involving the triplets form network systems that
are different for the self-complementary (SC) and the nonself-complementary (NSC) kinds (Table 2
shows the kinds of triplets; the networks are shown further ahead, Section 3.2). These are: SC with an

128

R and a Y in the lateral positions of the triplet (RNY, YNR), NSC with Rs or Ys in both lateral positions
(RNR, YNY).
Table 2. Splitting the boxes into 5 R and 5 Y halves and the base size ‘topographic landscape’ of the
triplets. Anticodon triplets are composed of the 5 base—the wobble position—plus the principal
dinucleotide (pDiN). The 16 pDiN deﬁne the 16 boxes. The 5 position ﬁlls boxes with options that
may be undeﬁned (N) or made explicit as G, C or Y, since the standard set contemplates the absence
of 5 A [21]. Purines (R) are two-ring bulky bases and pyrimidine (Y) one-ring small bases. When
they are together in a duplet or triplet, rugged topographies are presented for interactions; when the
duplet or triplet is composed homogenously by one kind—all R or all Y, the landscape is smooth or
planar. The self-complementary (SC) triplets may allow for self-dimerization and possibly transient
internal looping since the bases in the 5 and 3 positions are complementary to each other [7,22].
The nonself-complementary (NSC) triplets are maintained in the extended or open conﬁguration,
and only accept hetero-dimerization—the minihelices accommodate obligatorily different kinds of
triplets, obeying complementariness. The mixed pDiN is always part of rugged topography triplets;
the homogeneous pDiN may lose the planar landscape conﬁguration when it is part of a SC triplet;
only the NSC triplets of the homogeneous sector maintain the full planar character. Only the NSC
triplets, irrespective of sectors, maintain a symmetry center.

The networks formed by dimers of nonself-complementary anticodon triplets, after the known en
bloc 5 A elimination [21], become asymmetric and provide an easy way to start the encoding in the
modules (Section 3.2). Initiation and termination anticodes are proposed to be connected through a
mechanism of competition for pairing with the initiation codons, which resulted in the deletion of the
triplets corresponding to the termination codons (Section 5).
The amino acid and protein aspects of the coding system are presented with respect to the amino
acid composition of functional sequence segments or motifs (Section 4), and with respect to protein
metabolic stability—half-life (Section 4.3). A synthesis of the information on both components of
the system—triplets and amino acids—generated a chronology of encoding whose understanding
required close examination of pathways of amino acid biosynthesis. The resulting model says that the
code was formed entirely on biological-metabolic grounds, starting with one-carbon unit substrates to
form amino acids, followed by gluconeogenesis (Section 6). Relevant aspects of prebiotic chemistry are
discussed, facing the complexity of abiotic organics and the apparent simplicity of the C1 substrates.
Models for the genetic code that are based on the sets of prebiotic abundant amino acids are considered
proto-codes, possibly active in contexts where different oligomers could be adjusting their structures
among themselves inside aggregates. The modules in the structure of the whole set of triplet dimers
correspond to subsets of amino acids devoted to speciﬁc functions with the consequent regionalization
or clustering of the functions, which would be at the basis of the property of error-reduction in the
system (Section 7).
A schematic on the encoding process on the basis of proto-tRNA dimers follows. (a) In the
proto-biotic realm of events the interacting compounds are oligomers. There are various options
for their structures, still to be deﬁned. (b) These can function as pre/proto tRNAs: carriers of
monomers, among which there would be the amino acids. (c) They would also be apt for dimerization,
through complementary sites, and the stability of the dimer structure would propitiate the transferase
reaction. (d) In accordance with the types of monomers carried, they would produce of a variety of
129

oligomers/polymers, including peptides/proteins, which is Dimer-Directed Protein Synthesis (DDPS).
(e) Among the products some would be able to bind to the producers, or better, would stay bound
to the producers, forming pre/protonucleoproteins. (f) When these, at the least, do not harm but
maintain the producer activity and stabilize the complex, which lasts longer, the result is equivalent
to stimulating the activity. (g) This is the root of a positive feedback or self-stimulating system,
which is a kind of auto-catalytic network. (h) Some of these products would be structural, analogous
to ribosomal proteins, others enzymatic, such as the aRSs or members of biosynthesis pathways,
and so forth. (i) These compounds would manifest cohesiveness through binding protein-protein
and protein-nucleic acids etc., in the route to building proto-cell globules. (j) The encoding process
would require repetition of the production cycles where mutual adjustment of producers (dimers) and
products (peptides) would result in speciﬁcity of binding and of catalysis, which is the beginning of
ﬁxation of the tRNA-aRS-amino acid systems. (k) It is envisaged that at some point in the process
the dimers would be separated by the intromission of exogenous RNA. This would become later the
messenger RNA and the process of development of individualized charging systems is enforced.
3. Functionality in the Modular Organization
3.1. Hydropathy Correlation

The graph on the hydropathy correlation is an empirical demonstration that the set of anticodons
is organized in modules [23,24], therewith providing a structure for the code system (Figure 3).
The correlation is known for a long time (see [20]) but it was not conducive to modeling due to having
been based on data from amino acid molecules in solution. Our reexamination utilized data on amino
acid residues in proteins together with the principal dinucleotides (pDiN) of anticodons [20,23], which
was fruitful in generating the self-referential model.
The rationale for the separation of modules is based on complementariness of the codes. They are
seen here in a simpliﬁed way, through the pDiN (see Table 1), since data on triplets are not available
due to their limited solubility. We treat further down the complexity added with consideration of the
wobble base, together with other questions posed by this initial presentation of the modules, especially
on the chronology of amino acid encoding and of the associated functions.
The modular structure shown in Figure 3 does not separate the two parts of the mixed sector of
attributions, where the pDiN have one R and one Y base and pDiN hydropathies are intermediate.
The homogeneous sector, pDiN with both bases R or both Y and hydropathies extreme, is separated
into the central G:C and central A:U modules, with distinct behaviors. The central G:C should
have been encoded earlier than the central A:U due to the greater thermal stability, which coincides
with its simpler constitution, such as the lower number of attributions that corresponds to higher
average degeneracy (Section 7.1). This rationale is extended with the correlation data: encodings start
producing the non-correlated attributions (the central G:C module 1 of the homogeneous sector), then
develop a moderate inclination regression line (the central A:U, module 2), and end with the steeper
regression line of the mixed sector (modules 3 and 4).
Installation of the correlation in module 2 means that proteins composed by the set of ten amino
acids of the homogeneous sector would be complex enough to be able to construct enzyme pockets
and to develop speciﬁcity in interactions. One of such speciﬁc products is the correlation. The early
aRS pockets would accommodate amino acids and proto-tRNA segments (proto-anticodons) with each
other in a manner that would be more stable when they were coherent with respect to the hydropathy
behavior of the partners. When both were hydrophobic they would cooperate in expelling water out
of their interactive surfaces; when both were hydrophilic they would cooperate in organizing eventual
water molecules in the interactive sites. When such hydropathic coherence between partners would
not be established, cooperativity would fail leading to instability in the associations inside the pockets,
which would hamper the ﬁxation of a correspondence.

Figure 3. Correlation between hydropathies of amino acid residues in proteins and of dinucleotides.
The dinucleotides are considered the principal dinucleotides (pDiN) of anticodons. The regularity
in the distribution of anticodon types is clear [23]. The sector of mixed pDiN (circled in yellow and
with a steep regression line), composed of one R and one Y, has intermediate hydropathies but the
modules, one with the central bases G:C (amino acids in green), the other A:U (amino acids in red), are
not resolved. The homogeneous pDiN sector (strands RR or YY) has extreme pDiN hydropathies and
is separated into the two modules: hydropathies in the central G:C are not correlated (amino acids in
black) but those in the central A:U are correlated (amino acids in blue). Arginine is the only amino
acid belonging to both sectors. Note the extreme hydropathies of Lys and Phe; the * labels refer to the
atypical character of their synthetases, commented further down.

The constitution of the proto-tRNA involved in the associations in the non-correlated module 1
remains an open question. The lack of correlation could be due to poorness in the amino acid
constitution of the module 1 set or to a non-RNA or a pre-RNA constitution of the dimers. The lack of
correlation refers to the dinucleotides but there might have been a correlation between the amino acids
and whatever were the compounds in the dimers, which belong to the pre- or proto-biotic chemical
systems (some non-RNA options are in [25,26]).
Exclusion of Arg from module 1 brought clearness to the interpretation based on dimers of
anticodons. The hydrophilic Arg attributions traverse the sectors and are correlated coherently
with the triplet kinds but do not belong to the hydroapathetic group. Difﬁculties in rationalization
were reduced when only the Ser, Gly and Pro attributions could be interpreted as a coherent group.
The ‘enigma’ of the two Ser codes, which could not be explained in any of the previous studies
(see [27,28]), now receives an understanding based on dimer complementariness. The indication that
the Gly and Pro codes would also have belonged to an unforeseen pair (Table 1) found support only
when the interpretation provided by the metabolic pathways of amino acid biosynthesis entered the
argument. Both Pro and Arg biosyntheses derive from Glu so that their encoding followed that of
Glu, occurring in or after module 2. Therefore, the Pro-NGG correspondence would have been a
full concession from a previous Gly-NGG, as well as Arg-YCU would have been a concession from a
previous Ser-NCU that retained ﬁnally only the Ser-GCU anticode. It is indicated that the ﬁrst Arg
correspondence was made by the ArgRS with the YCU anticodes, in the homogeneous sector, thereafter
expanding the speciﬁcity of the recognitions also to accommodate the NCG, of the mixed sector, that

131

MDPI Books

is, developing the 3 U/G ambiguity. The third hexacodonic attribution shows a similar but simpler
3 R ambiguity, LeuRS for NAG and YAA.
3.2. Networks of Dimers in the Modules and the Encoding Process

We chose to examine the conﬁguration of the dimer sets by accepting only the standard kind of
base pair in the central position [29] and the unrestricted R:Y kinds in the lateral positions. Exclusion
of base A from the 5 position (Figure 4) is considered typical of the standard matrix of anticodes [21].
The networks distinguished, among the sets of triplets that compose the boxes (these deﬁned
by the pDiN), the self-complementary from the nonself-complementary. These kinds of triplets
present different thermodynamic parameters [22] and a main differentiating property is highlighted,
considered relevant for choosing among them for the protein synthesis activity of the dimers: pairs
composed by molecules bearing the SC kind would be neither always nor entirely free for the
hetero-referential dimerization due to the possibility of getting involved with self-dimerization [7]
(Figure 2).
A reason for the chronological precedence of the homogenous over the mixed sector of triplets
would be the simplicity of the former over the complexity of the latter (Table 2). An intuitive image
would take the ‘topographic landscape’ of the interaction surfaces that, in the minihelices, are in
the minor grooves. The mixed sector would be presenting for interactions a non-repetitive rugged
surface—bases in a string have different sizes, with bumps and depressions—in comparison with
the NSC triplets of the homogeneous sector where the topology is planar, monotonically repetitive,
therefore indicating a corresponding repetitiveness in the interacting partner. The rationale assumes
that repetitiveness in the structures would mean simplicity both in the mechanisms for producing
them and in their interactions, which would not require precise location of sites inside the repetitive
segments, therewith allowing for slippages [30]. The non-repetitive structures would require some
degree of speciﬁcity in the ordering or organization, and in both partners. Together with the above,
there is also the symmetric structure of the NSC triplets, irrespective of the sectors, which should
enlighten on the character of the primordial aRS pockets; the mature (present day) triplets are not
structurally symmetric but ‘wobble + pDiN’ and the aRSs follow this organization.
Another positive attribute of the NSC dimers for the protein synthesis activity and for the encoding
is consequent to the exclusion of 5 A, which reduced the size and produced an asymmetric topology
in the networks, and is repeated identically in the four modules. There are in each module two triplets
with 5 G connected to four with 5 Y, totaling eight dimers per module. Without the exclusion of a
base from the set in the 5 position, the network would contain 16 dimers, which is the size of the
SC 5 Y networks (dashed lines in blue, Figure 4A, top half). The other kind of SC dimers, with 5 G,
connect between themselves through a different topology, with a total of four dimers (dashed lines in
blue, Figure 4A, bottom half). Both the SC 5 G and the SC 5 Y are repeated twice and are internally
fully symmetric, another component of their disadvantage in comparison with the NSC. The process
of deciding on which dimer to choose for the ﬁrst encoding would take longer in symmetric networks,
and the degree of difﬁculty increases factorially with the size of the network. The encoding of the
second pairs, in each of the modules, is also facilitated by the asymmetry in the network of pairs,
which is a manifestation of the ﬂow from the 1st to the 2nd members of the modules.
The suggested process of encoding (Figure 5) does not involve a typical decision process due to
being almost ‘automatic’: the formation of the highest ΔG pair in the module (in the central rows of
the matrix, GNG:CNC [5]) is followed by lowered concentrations of ﬁve other pairs that members
of the ﬁrst pair would be involved with. Two dimers are left at high concentrations, for the second
encoding round, the low ΔG pairs (GNA:YNU, in the top and bottom rows of the matrix).

Figure 4. (A) Dimer networks. The nonself-complementary triplets (highlighted in yellow) pair among
themselves forming four identical networks, combining the central G:C triplets or the central A:U
triplets in each of the homogenous or mixed principal dinucleotide (pDiN) sectors. Connections in this
graph follow the diagonal black lines. These networks are asymmetrical due to the exclusion of the
base A from the 5 position, which is typical of the standard anticode [21], combining two 5 G with four
5 Y triplets (8 pairs). The self-complementary triplets (blue font) pair among themselves (connections
follow the rows, blue dashed lines) forming two kinds of networks: the 5 Y triplets are untouched by
the 5 A exclusion and the network of pairs among them is symmetric of size 16 (4 × 4); the network
of the 5 G triplets is also symmetric but of size 4 (2 × 2). Chronological numbering of the modules
(see text) follows both triplet kinds (homogeneous before mixed and, in each, central G:C before A:U)
and amino acid characters (metabolic pathways and protein properties; see text); (B) Meanings of the
triplets in the dimer network format. The three instances where the meanings would indicate the
dimer-directed diagonal organization (in circles) are either partial (the Ser-NGA : Ser-NCU pair is
corrupted by the Arg-YCU ‘invasion’; the initiation iMet-CAU would pair with the termination X-YUA,
which would require some peculiar wobble-pairing between pyrimidines, but not with the X-UCA) or
not obvious to the non-informed reader in the case of the Phe-GAA: Lys-YUU pair, where the link in
the pair is through the respective aRSs that are both atypical (see text).

Figure 5. Mechanism of encoding the NSC modules. Two steps are sufﬁcient for the description: the
high ΔG pair would be stable enough to propitiate the transferase reaction and to accommodate the
binding of the peptide product to itself; the ﬁve other pairs these triplets would also be involved with,
of lower ΔG, become scarce, so that the two pairs left free to form are now in high concentration,
which should facilitate the second round of encoding. Note that some of the present attributions in the
homogeneous sector do not coincide with the constraints imposed by the metabolic pathway adopted
in our scheme (see below) and require the proposition of concessions from an earlier occupier of the
triplet (proposed by the metabolic scheme) to the present occupier. Three of these are related to the
late entrance of the Glu family of amino acids (in red font), which does not belong to the proposed
ﬁrst metabolic pathway—the Glycine-Serine Cycle: in module 1 pair a, GGG-Gly conceded to Pro and
in pair b YCU-Ser conceded to Arg; in module 2 pair a, CUC-Asp conceded to Glu. The other is Phe,
whose biosynthesis requires a sugar (green) component. There are two pathways for the biosynthesis
of Lys, involving either Asp or Glu derivations. After this stage of encodings, there are no more
metabolic constraints.

We could not ﬁnd any interesting possibility for participation of the SC subnetworks in the
encoding process. It is possible that they would be involved in integration of the networks of dimers
(the NSC, diagonal, with the SC, horizontal) or in regulatory processes but this has not been speciﬁcally
tested, except graphically. An integrative role is plainly acceptable for the protein associations in the
Multi-aRS Complexes [31], and the aRSs in the complex would be further associated through the dimers
they bring in together with them ([5,17]; an update is available as Supplementary Information 1),
including the SC subnetworks.
The encoding process can be followed through studies on the aRS/tRNA interactions.
We compiled data reviewed by Beuning and Forsyth [32] and displayed them according to a succession
from high to low degeneracy (Table 3). The data are consistent with an evolution of the interactions
from simple to complex, with respect to involvement of the anticodon bases. The high degeneracy
aRSs, for the hexa- and tetracodonic amino acids, do not bind the base in the 5 position (nucleotide 34).
The aRS/tRNA recognition involves nucleotides outside the anticodon or, when they interact with the
anticodon, it is done through the principal dinucleotide (nucleotides 35–36). The low degeneracy aRSs
134

MDPI Books

Life 2017, 7, 16

bind the three anticodon bases. There are only two exceptions to the rule, which are amino acids in the
5 G of the neighbor boxes of Tyr and His.
Table 3. Evolution of aRS/anticodon interactions. The data, compiled from [32] are consistent with
the proposition that the initial encoding of a (proto)tRNA is dictated by the protein (aRS) binding to
it, which may or may not involve the anticodon. When it involves the anticodon, it is directed to the
principal dinucleotide, which means a full box degeneracy, the 5’ base being N. Evolution of proteins
with the enlarged amino acid ‘alphabet’, required creation of some multi-meaning boxes, which is
accompanied by interaction of the aRS with all three positions in the anticodon. The six stages are
1 = module 1; 2 = module 2; 3 = maturation of the homogeneous sector (modules 1 + 2); 4 = module 3;
5 = module 4; 6 = amino acids in the initiation NAU and the double-termination sign NUA pair of boxes.

An important step in the encoding process was the creation of asymmetry inside the originally
symmetric networks of dimers. If the encoding were to be done in the latter, some decision-type
process would be required but it would take long to resolve via iterative cycles of many trials and
errors with few hits, as if they were ´stagnant´, with many weak and ﬂuctuating bindings in the
network. The ﬂow through the system would be impaired via turbulence, continuous back and forth
reactions, that is undecidability. There would be many factors involved in establishing a gradient type
push-pull dynamics favoring the symmetry-breaking process, not to be detailed here.
In the asymmetric network the solution comes up almost automatically, besides the expediency
resulting from the reduced size (from 16 to eight dimers) of the network: the ﬁrst encoding is in the
pair with the highest thermal stability and the second encodings are directed to the pairs left behind at
high concentration (Figure 5). Asymmetry was created by elimination of a base from the set in the 5’
position. Any base would do the job but one had to be chosen. We could not ﬁnd a major component
that directed the choice to A but a list of factors is offered, still to be adequately weighed and combined.
(1)

Keep the (a) high stability of the G:C pair plus the (b) mono-speciﬁcity of C and bi-speciﬁcity of
G. The choice becomes between A and U, where A is tri-speciﬁc and U tetra [21].

Avoid the very weak A:C pair at the laterals of the triplets, in favor of the G:U, which is frequent
in RNA. Among the eight dimers in a module, the structure is exactly repetitive. Counting the
numbers of lateral base pairs, excluding 5 A makes G:C 6, G:U 6, A:C 2, A:U 2 while excluding
5 U would make G:C 6, G:U 2, A:C 6, A:U 2.
Keep U due to its being the base most used for modiﬁcations, provided that these would already
be present at the times of developing the 5 elimination [33,34].
Keep U to proﬁt from its tetra-fold ambiguity at decoding, as used in full in today’s vertebrate
mitochondria [35].
Presence of A at the 5 position in the P-site anticodon would, in a not well explained manner,
destabilize the codon-anticodon pair in the A-site [36].

In view of the weakness in any of the single choices offered above, we prefer to adopt a rationale
inspired on protein folding studies [37]: (a) The pressure for creating the asymmetry came via the
ﬂow. Any loss of a base would facilitate the ﬂow from the ﬁrst to the second round of encodings in
a module, which was beneﬁcial in reducing turbulence in the system caused by excess of substrates.
(b) The choice for A utilized the strategy of ‘minimum harm’, which would be greater at elimination of
any other base. It is rationalized that the avoidance of 5 A should be en bloc in view of the repetitive
mutational formation of such kinds of tRNAs, which would be located anywhere in the space of tRNAs.
This rationale is similar to that explaining the formation of eventual termination suppressors, which
are continually scrutinized for deletion. Genomic data show that the absence of 5 A anticodes is at the
gene level [38–40].
A global logic key for the encoding process produces the following summary. The homogeneous
sector is encoded before the mixed sector. In each sector, the central G:C module is encoded before
the central A:U module. According to the asymmetry produced by the 5 A exclusion, the high
ΔG pair—whose members reside in the two central rows of the matrix, nonself-complementary
GNG:CNC—is encoded ﬁrst, leaving the lower ΔG pairs for the last encodings, whose members reside
in the upper and lower rows of the matrix, nonself-complementary GNA:YNU. The self-complementary
triplets are encoded afterwards, via expansion of the degeneracy of the ﬁrst encodings in the box,
which is directed to the pDiN. In case a box receives new attribution(s), triplets are conceded to them,
which are usually the 5 Y anticodons to aRSs class I; exceptions are the two atypical aRSs of class II
that will be treated further down.
4. Protein Secondary Structure, Nucleic Acid Binding and Composition of Termini

Some properties of peptides or proteins were examined with respect to amino acid composition,
with the purpose of attributing functional meaning to the modules and helping in the establishment of
their chronology.
4.1. Secondary Structure

The homogeneous sector codes for the non-periodic protein secondary structures (Table 4; original
data in [41]). All amino acids preferred in protein non-periodic segments (including coils and turns)
belong to the homogeneous sector (GNPSD); those preferred in α-helices are distributed in the two
sectors, namely, homogeneous (ELKR) and mixed (AMQRH); those preferred in β- strands are mostly
in the mixed sector (VIYCWT), only one in the homogeneous sector (F). The same trend is built by
the data on amino acids builders of Intrinsically Disordered segments of proteins (data from [42]).
The latter is especially important for the model, indicating the role of non-structured segments of
proteins in not constraining the kinds of structures that may be accepted for interactions and in offering
open choices for development of structures after the interactions, besides the possibility of maintaining
the disordered character even after the interactions [43–45].

DNA- and RNA-binding motifs (IYRQW, Arg belongs to both sectors of the code). Asp and Asn were
not preferred in any nucleic acid-binding motifs. The compilation [46] does not consider highly basic
motifs owing to their non-speciﬁcity for bases, interacting mostly with the sugar-phosphate backbones.

The two criteria above are linked. Radivojac et al.’s review [42] is nicely consistent with our
proposition for the self-referential function of early proteins, explicitly citing the intrinsically disordered
regions as characteristic of ribosomal proteins and of the splicing complex proteins. These sets
encompass proteins bearing the RRM (RNA Recognition Motif, Gly-rich); the intrinsically disordered
regions are also rich in Ser and Arg, which sum to the Module 1 subset (GS) of our previous list of
amino acids typical of RNA-binding motifs [46].
4.3. Protein Termini and the N-End Rule

Data from the N-end rule of protein stabilization against degradation [47–50] and from statistical
frequency of amino acids in the N- and C-terminal segments of proteins [51] (respectively left and right
in Figure 6) are shown to superpose coherently upon each other. There is overall consistency between
the two modes of examining protein strings, indicating that properties of amino acids generating the
N-end rule were utilized by cells to locate stabilizing amino acids at the heads and destabilizing at the
tails, which could be considered a primitive ´punctuation´ system [52].
The circularly ‘closed’ mode of presenting the code system derives from an informational
description. Both the N-end rule and the protein termini regularities, plus the link between the
137

MDPI Books

Life 2017, 7, 16

punctuation signs (see below) conjoin to produce the informational closure drawn as a circle. Amino
acids that are stabilizers of proteins against degradation are all at the left side. The drawing also
requires that the codes in module 1, pairs 1 and 2, follow each other in tandem, initiating a central loop
structure. Otherwise, amino acids of modules 3 and 4, when corresponding to central R triplets, are
added backwards in the string, following from module 1 pair 1 (the initial head) to the direction of
the future head (Met); the neck keeps growing until the set of amino acids is exhausted. Amino acids
that are destabilizers of proteins when added to the N-ends, therefore being preferred to compose
the C-ends (tails), are all at the right side of the circle. The early loop is completed by adding, still in
tandem, module 2 to pair 2 of module 1. By the end of this loop, the amino acid Arg that ﬁlls up the
homogeneous sector and initiates the mixed sector is added as the primitive tail. This is then elongated
forward with addition of the amino acids in modules 3 and 4, taken from the central Y triplets, in the
direction of the future tail and the termination codes. The closure is accomplished by the mechanistic
and informational link between initiation and termination (topic below).

Figure 6. Amino acids displayed according to the N-end rule (left) and to their preferential location in
protein termini (right). The N-end rule classiﬁes amino acids as strong stabilizers of proteins against
catabolism (grades 1, 2; respectively GPMV, SAT) when the half-life of proteins bearing those amino
acids at the N-terminus is long; strong destabilizers (grades 8, 9; RK, LFWY) when the half-life is
drastically shortened; and intermediate (grades 3–7; CDENQIH). Data on preferential location of amino
acids at protein terminal segments suffer from database-dependency and from frequent ambiguities,
when amino acids are preferred or avoided in both locations (Amb). H (head), signiﬁcant statistical
preference at the N-terminus (H1), at the second position (H2), or when the two ﬁrst positions are
summed as a dipeptide (H1 + 2); T (tail), signiﬁcant statistical preference at the C-terminus (T1), at the
second position (T2), when the preference is signiﬁcant at both last positions individually (T1, 2),
or when the two last positions are summed as a dipeptide (T1 + 2). In spite of the care taken by the
authors with the sample sizes examined and the statistical processing, some results may suffer from
deﬁciencies, such as the difﬁculties with Pro, signiﬁcantly preferred in heads only in fungi, repeating
the problems at trying to experimentally add it to the heads of proteins [47], and with the overall low
frequency of Trp.

5. Location of the Punctuation Codes

The puzzle set forth by the indication that the boxes where the initiation Met and the termination
double signs are located, respectively NAU:NUA, form a pair is only accentuated at closer examination.

The real triplets do not pair due to incompatible wobble bases CAU:YUA. The other termination box,
bearing the single sign UCA would not pair with the iMet but shows partial non-aligned identity,
of the CA doublets. We were unable to ﬁnd previous studies relating the initiation and termination
codes or mechanisms. Such complication prompted a full examination of all possible connections
between triplets of the related boxes: identity or complementariness, alignment or the different possible
slippages, codons and anticodons. The demarcation criterion is that a mechanism should accommodate
all entities involved in one same explanation: the initiation Met, alone or in combination with the
second triplet, and the three X together with their neighbors in the respective boxes. The meaningful
resulting combination is presented in Figure 7. The consensus constitution of the mostly virtual X
anticodes, which are not present except for the suppressor instances, is YYA, minus the Trp-CCA.

Figure 7. Localization of termination codes and elimination of the correspondent tRNAs directed by the
initiation mechanism. Initiation. The principal dinucleotide of the initiation anticodon is slipped so that
the wobble position is the 3’ (alternative codons would be Val-GUG and Leu YUG). The consequence is
a strengthening of the initiation mechanism where there is no wobbling interposed between the two ﬁrst
coding triplets. The two frequent kinds of initiation couple of triplets is presented, Met-Val and Met-Thr.
Note the peculiar arrangements of the contiguous principal dinucleotides, respectively, an inverted
repeat wUG.GUw codons or a direct complement wUG.ACw. Termination. Our search for connections
between the initiation and termination codes tested all possibilities of identity or complementariness
and with alignment or the two kinds of slippages. Only the conﬁguration displayed satisﬁed the
condition of involving coherently the three termination codes: the principal dinucleotides of the boxes
containing the termination codes align with the principal dinucleotide of the initiation Met and the
wobble base aligns with ﬁrst base of the second triplet. A conﬂict is instantiated where the 5’Y triplets
of the cited boxes compete with the initiation Met-Val or Met-Thr anticodon doublets. This would have
been the reason for eliminating the conﬂicting anticodons while keeping the initiator Met, which created
the termination codons, void of decoding tRNAs. It is as yet not known whether the tRNATrp CCA
was previously encoded, probably tRNATrp YCA , therefore retained, or was encoded afterwards, being
recoded from XYCA which conceded XCCA to TrpCCA ; in both cases, mechanisms should be added to
protect initiation from the conﬂict. It is highlighted the crucial determinant 3’A of the X anticodes,
which conserves the Watson:Crick type pair through all tests and should have been a main guide for the
X tRNA exclusions. Key: N = bases of the principal dinucleotides of the initiation triplets; N = standard
complementariness of the termination anticodon base to the codon base, which is identity with the
iMet anticodon; N = G:U base pair, N = termination anticodons that were deleted; N = ﬁrst anticodon
base whose complementariness to the ﬁrst base of the second amino acid (Val or Thr) indicates the
mechanism of competition with the initiation anticodon but gives no indication as to how it would
have contributed to the retention or concession of the Trp anticode.

The obvious message, which nonetheless deserves highlighting is that, in all steps of the protein
synthesis system, the basis is the construction of a peptide bond, which involves a couple of tRNAs.
These are laterally associated in the case of translation and dimerized through an anticodon minihelix
in our DDPS model for the code origin (Figure 2). Installation of initiation involved a reconﬁguration
of the elongation mechanisms to eliminate a wobble position between the two ﬁrst codes, which may
be described as a functional ‘inversion’ of the ﬁrst triplet. Such inversion would be analogous to the
capping process that is observed in mRNAs of eukaryotes. Our results indicate that this mechanism,
at the same time, created conﬂicts with some anticodons that had to be eliminated therewith originating
the Stop (X) codons (Figure 7).
The connection between initiation and termination is most probably only in trans. The conﬂictive
termination tRNAs would meet the interference sites through diffusion, not involving direct physical
contacts between rostral and caudal portions of the mRNAs. Observations on circular RNA
conﬁgurations pop up eventually in the bibliography but they are neither typical of nor compelling
for [53] application in mRNA conformations. After the mechanism of termination tRNA exclusion
was installed, some other tRNAs may mutate to acquire that constitution, then called termination or
non-sense suppressors [54,55]. Such mutational events should be continually purged by purifying
selection. Otherwise, the circular drawing of the code seems to be plainly justiﬁed on the basis
of the informational closure character, which is also esthetically appealing to indicate that the
encoding process probably reached completion in extent, while not prohibiting further evolutionary
modiﬁcations inside the system.
It could be envisaged that the punctuation system was installed upon a full set of elongation
encodings. In this context, initiation would have to recode a previous triplet, which was achieved
through a principal dinucleotide ‘slippage’ from the elongation w CAU to the initiation CAUw . Another
immediate consequence of the mechanism would be the creation of conﬂicts with competing tRNAs,
whose identity, to become the terminators, would only depend on the identity of the chosen initiator.
In this case, when the choice of one depends also on the possible conﬂictive consequences, it is
suggested that the process involved some multifactorial iterative variety of trials, errors and hits.
The natural case was constrained by the amino acid properties that gave rise to the N-end rule,
therewith reducing the amplitude of the window of trials: initiation was directed to an N-end stabilizer,
located at the N-end segment, whose conﬂictive tRNAs would correspond to an N-end destabilizer,
located at the C-end segment. It should be interesting to investigate two related points that could
test the credibility of the mechanism proposed: (a) which would be the characters of the Trp system
that allowed its retention without interfering with the initiation system, and (b) is there some kind of
toxicity directed to the initiation subsystem when there are nonsense suppressor tRNAs or recoded X
codons [56] in the system?
RNP World Instead of RNA World

The existence of protein translation factors that mimic the shapes of tRNAs, which include the
Release Factors (RFs), would easily suggest that the latter came into the play as substitutes for the
tRNAs complementary to the X codons. There are many other instances of reduction of the tRNA
set, most appealing the generally forbidden 5’A anticodons. This rationale would be part of the RNA
World proposition [57–59], indicating that RNAs started the construction of the biosystem and at some
point developed the proteins as functional helpers for structures and catalysis, and developed the DNA
as more stable genomic helpers, thereafter receding to the job of intermediates between those. These
propositions seem to be now being made more ﬂexible in favor of the coevolutionary panorama [16],
that is, some kind of an RNP World preceding the present cellular DNP World, which is in entire
consistency with the proposal of the Self-Referential Model (SRM), as sketched in Figure 2.
The cases of protein-nucleic acid mimicry are now known to be more extensive and
multifaceted [60–62]. The emergent consensus for the cases of tRNA mimicry in translation factors is
that it refers mostly to the shapes of the tRNAs, necessary to ﬁt the pockets and tunnels of the ribosome,

140

while some of the functional details may differ from the expected if they would be substituting the
tRNA functions [63,64]. It is realized that tRNAs are not capable of terminating protein synthesis,
which requires protein activities. Termination may be achieved through a variety of ways, including
the traditional absence of X anticodons, but it may occur even in the absence of the X codons, where
it may rely upon directions given by other features of the mRNA 3’ end [65,66]. Even one of the
paradigmatic proposed ribozyme activities, the ribosomal Peptidyl Transferase Center, has been
drastically challenged [67,68] and is under reevaluation.
6. Metabolic Pathways

The chronology offered by the self-referential model (SRM) clashes with the traditional studies
on the origins of the code [69–78]. These are centered on the set of amino acids that are produced
in relative abundance under prebiotic conditions, possibly representing what would be expected
from early Earth geochemical systems. Even the coevolution hypothesis, saying that much of the
code organization is derived from amino acid biosynthesis pathways, starts with the geochemical
set [70,71,78]. This is centered on the amino acids in the 3’C row of the matrix Val Ala Gly Asp, which
could also proﬁt from high stability of some triplet pairs such as codons Ala-GCC:GGC-Gly, less so
in Val-GUC:GAC-Asp. This coincidence between an all-G:C triplet pair carrying the most abundant
prebiotic amino acids gave origin to the proposals [72,76,77] based on the Ala and Gly correspondences.
Note that this choice through rows has to rely upon self-complementary triplets. In the coevolution
hypothesis, the hybrid molecules aminoacyl-tRNAs would be able to generate concertedly amino
acid families of biosynthetic derivations and tRNA variants. The biosynthesis pathways recalled
to be involved in structuring the code were the traditional heterotrophic and catabolic, centered on
glycolysis, the pentose shunt and the citrate cycle.
Our starting amino acids Gly and Ser did not ﬁt any of the propositions above. The couple
of the most abundant prebiotic is Gly and Ala. The derivation of Gly and Ser from the glycolysis
route starts with a phosphorylated compound and follows the degradative path from C6 to C3 and
then to C2, which is not an easy path for initial evolution to work with; the last transformations are
3-phosphoglycerate → 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate → 3-phosphoserine → Ser → Gly. A main problem
with respect to the encoding process relying upon prebiotically synthesized amino acids would be the
frequent and drastic ﬂuctuations in precursor availability, approaching the ‘feast and famine’ regimes,
which would not be adequate for ﬁxation of encodings; these would require reliable and reasonably
continuous sources of the substrates. In the panorama of the SRM, propositions based on the sets
of prebiotic abundant amino acids could have corresponded to proto-codes where proto-tRNAs and
peptides might have possibly passed through processes of mutual adjustments.
We found a simple pathway at pan-searching inside microbial biochemical diversity, the Glycine-Serine
Cycle (Figure 8), more frequently called the Serine Cycle [79–81], which ﬁts the SRM modular scheme.
It belongs to the C1 realm of metabolism and is typical of Type II Methylotrophs (α-proteobacteria,
the same group where mitochondria originated from), while having sectors of compounds that overlap
other pathways and other groups of organisms. It is the simplest among central metabolic routes,
starting with the C2 glyoxylate and reaching the maximum C4. It is said that nowadays its main
function would be of producing AcetylCoA from C1 units. These are one CO2 and one reduced kind
of C1, brought in by the TetraHydroFolate (H4 F, THF) or the correlate and older H4 MethanoPTterine
(H4 MPT) carrier. Such kind of pathway is already at the bottom row of simplicity with respect to
the substrates, at the fuzzy borders between methylotrophy and autotrophy. Methylotrophs and
methanotrophs are not considered autotrophs because they have wider metabolic abilities in the
assimilation realm; they are able to incorporate some of the partially oxidized C1 compounds into
cellular carbon before they are completely oxidized to CO2 , this being directed to energy production.

Figure 8. The Glycine-Serine Cycle. This is at the bottom layer of complexity among the assimilation
central metabolic pathways. Just one step above the basal synthesis of Acetate, it reaches C4 compounds
through additions of a reduced carbon (C1-H4 F) and a CO2 . Glyoxylate is aminated to Glycine and
this receives a –OH-methyl to form Serine. These amino acids can feed directly the ﬁrst module of
the code. Various C3 derive from Ser, which can feed gluconeogenesis and synthesis of the Pyruvate
family of amino acids. Addition of the CO2 forms the C4 compounds where the oxaloacetate family
of amino acids derive, gluconeogenesis is again nourished, other key connections are established
from Malate and MalylCoA. This breaks into two C2 compounds that regenerate the cycle starter and
generate AcetylCoA.

The Gly-Ser Cycle can be divided into (a) a core portion, which is the C2 + Ser cut that could
be considered a nearly autonomous subcycle, and (b) the more complex set of the C3 derivatives
from Ser plus the C4 compounds, some of which may feed directly on to the gluconeogenesis
and the Citrate Cycle. Elements in the core are connected via the Gly ←→ Ser interconversion
through the H4 Folate carrier of the hydroxymethyl radical –CH2 OH and the enzyme SHMT
(Serine HydroxyMethylTransferase, SHMT, which is dependent on Pyridoxal-phosphate, PLP). This
enzyme belongs to a peculiar family whose reactions and functions are much varied, sometimes
called even ‘promiscuous’, which seems to ﬁt adequately the requirements for early processes [82].
A deamination/amination reaction further unites, respectively, the Ser → HydroxyPyruvate conversion
to the Glyoxylate → Glycine conversion. This core portion is nearly universally distributed and at the
roots of autotrophy [83], therefore more relevant to support the earliest stage (module 1: Gly and Ser)
of the genetic code. The relevance of the C3 and C4 portion for the next stage (module 2: Leu, Asp and
Asn) of the code ﬁts nicely our scheme but biochemists might question the validity of the proposal
mainly in view of the supposed involvement of those reactions with oxygenated environments while
it is also assumed that the code would have been formed under anoxic conditions. It is recalled
that there are many possible variations on the insertion of the simple pathways of Serine synthesis,
including some anaerobic [84], while the phosphorylated catabolic pathway became predominant at
heterotrophy [85].
The homogeneous sector of codes contains presently other ﬁve amino acids, four of them in the
Glu family plus the Phe, whose biosynthesis requires a sugar compound coming from the pentose
shunt. We therefore add a stage of ‘metabolic maturation of most of the central pathways’, necessary
for the completion of the homogeneous sector encodings. These pathways develop from the serine
cycle C3 and C4 compounds into gluconeogenesis and then glycolysis, the pentose shunt and the
citrate cycle. The key role of Glu in this stage of encodings, just at the border between the two sectors
142

MDPI Books

Life 2017, 7, 16

of the code, is reminiscent of the discussion asking for the causes of obligate autotrophy and obligate
methanotrophy, which is supposed to reside in the sensitive step involving the loss of the α-keto
glutarate dehydrogenase activity [86]. Such deﬁciency divides the citrate cycle into ‘halves’, the cycle
assuming a ‘horseshoe’ shape: the C4 portion in one side and the C6-C5 in the other side. Such
situation is also called an ‘incomplete’ citrate cycle, indicating that the cycle would have been formed
or ‘completed’ through the fusion of the two sides promoted by the C5→C4 processing enzyme. It is
tempting to propose that this maturation step was limiting also to the process of traversing between
the code sectors via ArgYCU → ArgNCG since Arg is derived from Glu.
The phylometabolic approach [83] also reached the H4 Folate/H4 MPT roots of autotrophic
pathways. The bioenergetics group of William Martin pointed to the Ljungdahl-Wood autotrophic
pathway, which also has some steps involving H4 Folate/H4 MPT carriers but is very complex with
respect to the variety of cofactors required for the biosynthesis of AcetylCoA [87,88]. A portion of this
route is shared with the methanogenic pathways. Despite the simplicity of the Glycine-Serine Cycle
and in face of the basal autotrophic routes for production of AcetylCoA being complex, there is the
appealing possibility of biochemistry having started from geochemical C2 units, acetate and derived,
which could be a reliably abundant source in some adequate environments, utilizing the H2 reductant
produced at serpentinization [87,89,90] (I thank Yoshi Oono for this suggestion).
An apparent inconsistency in our chronology of amino acid encoding is the precocious presence
of the C6 Leu, together with the C4 of module 2. Searches for proposals to substitute Leu by a simpler
amino acid reach the repetitive suggestions for the central A column having been initiated with the C5
Val. Even if this suggestion is adopted, the inconsistency remains more or less of the same magnitude.
The fact of Leu biosynthesis incorporating two molecules of pyruvate, the same occurring with Val
biosynthesis, might make the discrepancy more acceptable in the sense of not becoming too complex
with respect to sources of substrates. It might also be relevant to biochemistry the prebiotic tendency
of pyruvate (the same with other α-keto acids, reactive compounds) to engage in highly complex
derivations, including its dimerization into parapyruvate and formation of up to C8 compounds, that
are obtained from pyruvate of carbonaceous meteorites in water [60]. Otherwise, it is possible that Ala
might have been the precursor to Leu in module 2, as indicated by the existence of a variant of this
kind in mitochondria of a few ﬁlamentous Saccharomycetacea and Debasyomyces [91].
Amino Acid Hydrodynamic Size and the aRS Classes

A synthetic description of some characters of the development of encoding (Figure 9) by the aRSs
can be obtained from the correlation between the increasing amino acid size [92] and biosynthetic
pathway complexity (number of steps and diversity of compounds). A trend is shown, starting
(module 1) with small amino acids and increasing sizes steadily to the end of the homogeneous sector,
thereafter maintaining large average sizes. Variability is high in intermediate stages and lower in the
sets of modules 1 and 4. Enzymes class II are typical of small and class I of large amino acids. ArgRS
traverses the sectors. The Figure 9 graph can be paralleled with the hydropathy graph (Figure 3) to form
groups of amino acids for the modules: the starting amino acids are (module 1) small, hydroapathetic
and class II; these amino acids are among the constant and frequent oligomers of putative earliest
proteins [93]. The last amino acids (module 4) are large, hydrophobic and mostly class I. Intermediate
stages explore the entire hydropathy range.
The atypical aRSs are class II for the only large amino acids of the class, and of extreme
hydropathies: PheRS, acylating in the class I mode (2 ), and LysRS, class I or II in different organisms,
the class II being the only in the class to occupy a 5 Y set of anticodes. These occupy the last pair
of triplets of the homogeneous sector GAA:YUU. The complete set of atypical aRSs includes amino
acids beyond the standard 20. There are two additions, Selenocysteine (Sec, the 21st amino acid) and
PheRS
Pyrrolysine (Pyl, 22nd), which makes the anticodon pair 5GAA
3UUY LysRS only the prototype for the atypical
systems. These remain all class II affecting the two Stop boxes. The class II typical acylation site is 3
(Gly Pro Ser Ala Thr His), while Asp Asn are variable; the class I typical acylation site is 2´ (Leu Arg

143

MDPI Books

Life 2017, 7, 16

Glu Val Ile Met), while Cys Trp Gln Tyr are variable [94]. Distribution of the aRS classes according to
the utilization of the 5 bases in the multi-meaning boxes obtains: 5 R is variable (class II Phe SerCU
His Asp Asn/class I Ile Cys Tyr) while 5 Y is homogeneously class I or punctuation (LeuAA Ile Met
Trp X Arg Gln Glu), plus the atypical Lys. There are some organisms that charge Lys via a class I
enzyme, which is typical [95].

Figure 9. Amino acid hydrodynamic size, aRS classes and metabolic maturation. Enzymes class I in
blue, class II green. Average amino acid side chain size [92] for the module in black. LysRS is uniquely
class I or II (atypical) in different organisms. PheRS is also atypically a class II that acylates in the class I
mode (2 ). The metabolic pathways relevant to the encoding chronology are the Glycine-Serine Cycle,
whose core coincides with module 1, while the C3 derivatives of Ser and the C4 compounds coincide
with precursors to the amino acids in module 2. Other amino acids had to wait for development of the
other central metabolism pathways, after gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, the pentose shunt and the citrate
cycle. There are no metabolic constraints upon the mixed sector encodings.

The other atypical systems share aspects with the prototypes. Charging of both amino acids
Sec and Pyl repeat the LysRS class II atypical attribution to 5 Y anticodes, but in tRNAs (anticodons,
UCA and CUA, respectively) that were introduced to decode Stop codons, whose tRNAs are not
present (X) in the standard anticode. These cases are called recoding of X codons and differ from
the termination suppression in being internal and functional in protein sequences. Termination
suppression is deleterious to protein functions due to the extended anomalous C-termini.
There is an alternative route for the charging of Cys, via the O-phosphoseryl charging of tRNACys
by a PheRS homolog (SepRS), which maintains the 2 acylation site. The Sep-tRNACys is thereafter
transformed into Cys-tRNACys . A tRNASec with anticodon UCA (principal dinucleotide underlined),
which is not present in the standard anticode set (it corresponds to the X codon UGA), is serylated

144

MDPI Books

Life 2017, 7, 16

by the standard SerRS. The seryl moiety is then phosphorylated (to Sep) and this transformed to
selenocysteine (Sec), to get the ﬁnal product Sec-tRNASec . The pathway to Pyl starts with its synthesis
from two molecules of Lys. The PylRS is homologous to PheRS but the acylation site is the 3 , typical
of the class II enzymes, indicating that PylRS retains the original character of the class II that later
developed the atypical function, which is shared by PheRS and SepRS [96,97].
7. Symmetries and Error-Reduction in Modularity

Nucleic acids should be a prime locus for the generation of symmetric structures at the acquisition
of secondary or higher order organizations in view of their basic complementariness property.
There have been many attempts at reaching the depths of the genetic code structure through the
symmetry-search approaches (e.g., [98]) but most of them utilized codons and strings as the subject
matter and are still waiting for obtaining wider support. The appeal of symmetric arrangements would
reside on the possibility of facilitation of functional processes due to the repetitiveness that symmetries
offer, be they derived from duplications or convergence, from direct, inverted or complementary
arrangements, among other possibilities.
Our approach is centered on the elements proper to the encoding/decoding machinery—tRNAs
and their anticodons, aRSs and amino acids, considering the strings of codons later developments,
either enchained triplets derived from pre-encoded tRNAs [99–103] or exogenous strings that acquired
the ability of being translated through evolutionary adjustments. Such strings and the decoding
machinery would have coevolved with focus on e.g., speed while maintaining accuracy in translation,
in a process that might have not preserved the details of the process of encoding. This would be
a reason for the lack of success of the studies based on the strings of codons and we hope to have
uncovered some aspects of the encoding process through studies of anticodons.
7.1. Central Bases Compose Standard Base Pairs, Columns Are Divided into Hemi-Columns

The structure of tRNA pairs or dimers is the basal symmetric: the central base pair is of the
standard Watson: Crick type while the lateral base pairs allow for the generic R:Y, keeping ﬁxed the
base in the 3’ position and choosing among the variation in the wobble position (Table 1). The primacy
of the central base [29] is reﬂected in some regularities that are recognized in the code matrix since the
time of its deciphering about half a century ago, especially the correlation of the most hydrophobic
amino acids coinciding with the most hydrophobic central purine A, which is the ﬁrst column.
Our approach keeps this organization, improves the correlation (Figure 3) and adds the correction
that the vertical organization (in columns) derives from the juxtaposition of distinct hemicolumns.
These are formed in different sets of encoding events (numbered and colored in Figure 10c), one for
the homogeneous sector boxes (e.g., NAG, NAA; the central R of module 2) the other for the mixed
sector boxes (e.g., NAC, NAU; the central R of module 4). The horizontal organization (in rows) is
also a juxtaposition of distinct sets of encoding events. The ﬁrst pairs of the four modules (1a, 2a,
3a, 4a) that start with the nonself-complementary dimers (GNG:YNC) compose the two central rows,
one of them coinciding with the most traditional component of models for the code origins, which
are centered on the GADV row. The self-complementary YNG:YNG and GNY:GNY of the two rows
just cited are encodings secondary to the nonself-complementary. The orthogonal organization of the
matrix, through columns and rows, is now the result of overlapping crisscrossed hemi-columns whose
elements are pairs or dimers of triplets with a disposition that follows the diagonals inside the matrix.
The full symmetry in the distribution of mono- and multi-meaning boxes (see below) is a consequence
of this design.

Figure 10. Symmetries in the organization of the matrix of anticodon dimers. They are easier to follow
through the pairs of principal dinucleotides but are composed only by the nonself-complementary
triplets (with the 5’ bases boxed). (a) Eight separate pairs are shown united by lines of different colors
and shapes; (b) The pairs are united according to the composition of the degeneracy in the boxes:
light green, inner circle, two pairs of high ΔG, principal dinucleotides with Gs or Cs only, boxes
mono-meaning; dark green, outer circle, two pairs of low ΔG, principal dinucleotides with As and Us
only, boxes multi-meaning; intermediate circle, principal dinucleotides with one G or C and one A or U,
four pairs of intermediate ΔG, boxes mono-meaning when central base is R (dark grey), multi-meaning
when central base is Y (light grey). The process ran through the organization in pairs and sectors but
the ﬁnal result is fully symmetric so that no hint of a deeper organization is given to the observer;
(c) The pairs are united into modules and sectors. The format of presentation of the modules is different
from the matrix in Figure 4a.

Symmetries are not expected to be constructed on the basis of properties of amino acids. When
symmetric arrangements are observed on the basis of amino acid characters, they would probably
be following the symmetry that was constructed by the triplets. In fact, we could detect three such
instances (Figure 4b; one per module, except module 3, and all in the upper and lower rows) but none of
them would be compelling enough to have directed research projects focusing on those arrangements.
These molecules would, to the contrary, follow functional dictums of the protein segments they would
be constituents of, that were examined in Sections 3.1 and 4–6.
The central base primacy in dimerization of anticodons ﬁnds a different albeit convergent
counterpart in the codon-anticodon pairing. The ribosomal decoding center has an asymmetric
‘principal doublet-plus-wobble’ structure; the doublet of bases is contiguous but the third base comes
from a distant segment. The contacts made by the central base pair with the ribosomal center are

146

MDPI Books

Life 2017, 7, 16

more numerous than those of the other bases [104]. Evidence from the aRS-tRNA interactions [34]
(Table 3) indicates that the situation is highly complex. While bases are all contiguous in a triplet,
there are curvatures in the anticodon loop which would be behind the development of the asymmetric
interaction structure. We could attempt to suggest that the asymmetry would have derived from the
process of tightly packing the adjacent tRNA anticodon loops inside the ribosome at translation of a
continuous string. The forced accommodation of the loops required one of them to curve and yield
space to the other. The base that was dislocated became the wobble position. Later adjustments created,
among a variety of base selection and modiﬁcations, the peculiar U-turn that helps to stabilize the loop
when the principal dinucleotide is only moderately stable but has a purine central base [19,105].
7.2. Symmetry in the Distribution of Mono- and Multi-Meaning Boxes

The picture composed by dimers in the matrix is fully symmetric and smooth (Figure 10a).
The distribution of single- and multiple-meaning boxes follows the complete symmetry without any
deviation (Figure 10b). These characters did not catch the attention of previous observers beyond
the level of decoding where the explanation involves formation of codon: anticodon pairs [19,72,91].
The participation of anticodon dimers did not need to be invoked since questionings were satisﬁed by
the decoding function only.
The matrix presentation is clear enough to display the global result as the triple-circle concentric
arrangement (Figure 10b), relying upon the interpretation that base composition is accompanied by
the ΔG values (data in Supplementary Information 2). There is no inﬂuence of the modular structure
(Figure 10c) in the ﬁnal picture of the distribution of degeneracies. The inner circle is the core of the
matrix, composed by single-meaning and entirely G or C principal dinucleotides. These are able
to reach high thermal stability from three G:C base pairs with the correct choice of the wobble base
to form nonself-complementary triplets. It is indicated that such high ΔG offered high resistance
to being split into multiple attributions. The outer circle is composed by the tips of the matrix, all
A or U principal dinucleotides and multiple-meaning boxes. These lower thermal stability boxes
offered the least resistance to being split into multi-meanings. The principal dinucleotides in the
intermediate circle have one G or C and one A or U base, therefore reaching intermediate ΔG values.
A speciﬁc stabilizing factor is now recognized to be at work, namely a U-turn structure that can be
formed between a central anticodonic purine base (not with a central pyrimidine base) and the U-base
at position 33 [19,105]. Boxes remained with single-meanings when their triplets had a central R
and developed multiple-meanings when they were central Y. The full symmetry indicates that the
ΔG effects were obeyed strictly and that the affordances were proﬁted from to saturation. Further
informational necessities were fulﬁlled with added post-translational effects.
The reasoning above only makes sense when applied to the anticodon dimers and the aRSs that
are encoding the tRNAs. Base composition is accompanied by the ΔG values and the correlation with
the distribution of degeneracy per box is perfectly linear (Supplementary Information 2). The possible
participation of aRSs in the dimer structures has not been studied, as well as any possible inﬂuence on
thermodynamic parameters [22] between self- and nonself-complementary dimers.
7.3. Symmetry in Modules of Dimers and the Error-Reduction Property

The property of the encoding/decoding system of reducing the consequences of errors [106]
is indicated to derive from a regionalization of the attributions or correspondences in the modules
and sectors [107]. The conserved structure of the sets of triplets across modules would facilitate the
encoding process from the second module onward, after the ‘learning’ at construction of module 1.
The main difﬁculty presented to the aRS duplications would reside in adapting to different central
bases and in the change from the homogeneous to the mixed sector. At the same time, each new step
would beneﬁt from the expanded repertoire of amino acids encoded in the preceding step, that is,
the process incorporates cumulative and self-feeding characteristics.

Our limited list of protein properties examined supports the assertion. We detected (i) the
clustering of attributions dedicated to the construction of different protein motifs (ii) inside the modules
of dimers. The characters examined are coherent with the modules, which may be examined in different
formats of presentation, from the graphs in Figures 3 and 9 to the Tables 4 and 5 to the circular structure
of Figure 6, which may be extended into a string. The informational circle is read from the central and
ancient core of elongation codes—the homogeneous sector, to both extensions, backward and forward
to reach, respectively, the present conﬁguration of the initiation and the termination sites. The circle is
closed through the informational connections between initiation and termination.
The main character that oriented decisively the conﬁguration of the circular model (Figure 6)
was the N-end rule. The core of the process of building strings required tandem ligation of the
ﬁrst codes—module 1 (the N-ends of the cores) to the immediate followers—module 2 (the C-ends).
Modules 3 and 4 are then added by staggered ligation, extending the N-ends backwards and the
C-ends forwards. The attributions are shown in the order of encoding (Table 1). Functional characters
of the attributions are in Tables 4 and 5, Figures 6 and 9. The strict module 1 attributions (GPS)
form a conserved cluster through all characters: no hydropathy correlation, preferred in non-periodic
conformations, in RNA-binding motifs and contributing to protein stabilization. At the encoding
of all attributions of the homogeneous sector, amino acids preferred in nonperiodic conformations
are completed and a half of the preferred in protein α-helices are added, together with some others
preferred in RNA-binding motifs. Amino acids forming preferentially β-strands and DNA-binding
motifs are typical of the mixed sector (modules 3 and 4). The components of the NRY quadrant of
the mixed sector complete the sets of amino acids preferentially forming RNA-binding motifs and
contributing to N-end stabilization. Amino acids that destabilize proteins when residing in the N-ends
are all located in module 2 and in the C-end extension.
7.4. Metabolic Perspectives

The self-referential (SR) process, of protein products looping back to stabilize and stimulate the
nucleic acids—producers, thereafter memories in RNPs—has already received contributions from
diverse sources, beyond the proposition of the SRM [108,109]. Ribosomal proteins belong to the
category of Intrinsically Disordered [42], which is a character of the early encodings in the SRM.
Recent studies have even detected the possibility of ribosomal proteins being coded for by ribosomal
RNA [102], extending and updating our older propositions [99,100] on tRNA-rRNA homologies that
are consistent also with [110].
Main functional components in the self-referential processes are obviously the aRSs, whose
richness and diversity of activities range much more widely than the mere role in amino acid activation
and tRNA charging (e.g., [31]). It may be highly signiﬁcant to the SRM propositions to ﬁnd that
also some of the known instances of non-ribosomal protein or peptide synthesis (NRPS) [111–114]
share aspects showing similarities to what the SRM advocates. [I thank Gustavo Caetano Anollés for
bringing this to my attention]. Some proteins involved in NRPS show homologies to synthetases class
II, especially the SerRS, but are small and monodomain, not bearing the tRNA binding activity while
preserving the amino acid activation. Other instances of proteins active in NRPS show homologies to
synthetases class I, closer to the Tyr- and TrpRS, and do not activate amino acids but utilize a couple
of aminoacyl-tRNAs to promote sequential reactions for peptide synthesis and cyclo-dehydration.
These proteins are dated earlier than the translation machinery [110,115]. The diversity in NRPS is
large but the two examples collected here suggest an intriguing analogy with the bipartite structure
of tRNAs—one segment for the aminoacylation activity, the other for the anticodon. Tests are to
be devised to check whether these possible ´halves´ of the synthetase activities or domains are only
fortuitous results of deletions on the present-day genes or might be relics of an evolutionarily process
of independent origins of the segments that were joined into the present genes. The evolutionary
process of linking pieces might also leave fragile sites for genetic truncation, which will complicate
the investigation.

8. The Flow Is the Logic

MDPI Books

Life 2017, 7, 16

The scheme for the development of the biological ﬂow system draws a chain of internal sinks
(Figure 1) that is initiated at the protein synthesis subsystem. All other pathways converge here,
the bioenergetics plus the amino acid, nucleobase, nucleotide and nucleic acid polymer biosynthesis
pathways. It reaches an end at the cytoplasmic ﬁssion process which is part of cell reproduction.
The sink function keeps protein synthesis active, which drains and provides a ‘suction force’ (enzyme
pockets, carrier and receptor sites empty and ‘avid’—presenting high afﬁnity—for substrates) that shall
not let the system in danger of stagnation or blockade, and of the associated toxicities. Cytoplasmic
components should not accumulate to the point of saturation [116] that would inhibit protein synthesis.
When some of them are difﬁcult to get rid of, through degradation or extrusion [117–120], cytoplasmic
ﬁssion is a solution. Some of the waste that cannot be degraded will aggregate into clumps that are
allocated to one of the daughter cells, leaving the other healthy and clean [121].
If we consider that the picture described in the sections above answers some questions on the
origins of the encoding/decoding system—the origins of biological information [122,123], the most
difﬁcult aspect to be rationalized would be on the constitution of the geochemical pre- and proto-biotic
context that allowed the encoding system to be installed. After the start, the forward process—building
genetic strings—can at the least be sketched with some grounding. With respect to the backward
sightings, directly relevant to the triggering conditions for the initial encodings, we can only list some
indications derived mostly from the hydropathy correlation and the chronology of encodings.
Considering that the encodings required guaranteed amino acid availability from metabolic
pathways, that the chronology pinpointed the pathway of assimilation of C1 units into amino acids,
and assuming continuity of the prebiotic with the biologic realms, that is, the latter substituting the
former and conserving some records of it, we are allowed to suggest that the steps immediately prior to
the installation of the biologic process also included the production of amino acids from C1 units. Such
substrates would have been abundant and relatively constant, supporting both prebiotic and biotic
processes, which coincide with respect to the pathways of generating C2 compounds. It is a common
theme among the abiotic organics the higher concentration of acidic compounds, which include the
moderately reactive α-keto acids whose amination dampens their reactivity through the formation of
amino acids. These are obtained in meteorites at concentrations in parts-per-million while nucleobases
are in the range of parts-per-billion [69,124]. These became an important kind of monomeric substrate
for the dimer-directed synthesis of chains, including peptide chains (DDPS). Our focus on the biomass
aspect, via Gly and Ser, coincides with the bioenergetic aspect that focuses on AcetylCoA [79,83,87–89].
Our identiﬁcation of continuity with respect to Glycine seems justiﬁed but we cannot indicate the same
for Serine since prebiotic concentrations of this are generally low.
It is tempting to propose that the mechanism of dimer-directed synthesis of chains would have
had a prebiotic counterpart. A reasonable prebiotic source of oligomers would be the mineral surfaces
such as the crystals that compose clays [125]. Stability of the template would create repetitiveness
of production which is a result equivalent to the reproduction of the oligomers. Oligomerization of
slightly different monomers, such as purines and pyrimidines, or from complementary surfaces of the
mother crystal layers, could create the possibility of dimerization sites via complementariness. Our
hydropathy correlation data on the ﬁrst encodings leaves open the question on the character of the
dimerized oligomers. They might have been RNA and the lack of correlation due to the poorness of
the set of encoded amino acids, but the suspicion stays that they might not have been RNA. The RNA
world community has been able to offer bench modes of synthesis of nucleotides that are supposed to
be possible to have happened prebiotically [126], but there is no idea of its quantiﬁcation or localization,
while the real observations on chondritic meteorites says of amino acids being recovered in the range
of one thousand-fold more than nucleobases [69,124].
In face of the persisting doubts on the feasibility of a pure RNA world—in spite of the beauty in
the RNA technology, our studies are plainly consistent with an early RNP world, late DNP. The nucleic
acid and the protein component structures would have coevolved. The self-referential process
149

MDPI Books

Life 2017, 7, 16

depicted in Figure 2 suggests starting with the formation of RNP globules that have all components
held together via protein-protein and protein-RNA binding, not requiring too much from external
compartmentalization. The code is mute with respect to membrane structure or composition but it
would be adequate to accept the simple proposition that the surface of globules might have been
initially proteinic [127] that accommodated lipids around and in between the proteins [128], thereby
generating the composite membrane structures.
In the globules, the in versus out distinction would come, respectively, from the internal crowded
macromolecular gel structures, adhered to each other, in face of the external ﬂuid. The macromolecules
develop intense motility when imbibed in water, more intensely in proteins, less in DNA. The strings
are continually challenged by the polar and reactive character of water molecules, hitting either the
polar exposed sites of the monomers or the bonds between the monomers of the backbones of the
polymers, peptide and phosphodiester, always at the danger of hydrolysis. The trembling at the inside
of the spongy structures creates continuous exchanges of materials with the environments. Those
that are more necessary in the interior would be trapped there through binding. This process became
more easily controllable with the help of the sequestration of some compounds by the developing
lipid components.
A main component of the internal drive that keeps the ﬂow always active is the creativity
provided for by plasticity [10–12], which is a property most salient in proteins, less in DNA than
in RNA. The starting challenge that keeps activity restless would be water and its provocation of
hydrolysis which is followed by re-ligation or re-synthesis. These challenges are the sources and
triggers of plasticity when they may (1) generate functional novelties, at modiﬁcation of conformations
and activities of the polymers and (2) generate structural and functional novelties, when re-ligation and
re-synthesis produce new and different kinds of proteins and genes. Plasticity creates diversity, which
are the basic richness of biosystems. The diversity is organized into structures under the inﬂuence,
among many factors, of the ﬂow itself. The ﬂow is morphogenetic, the structures become compliant
with and facilitators of the ﬂow. I recall having heard in the early 1970s from the late David P. Bloch and
read from Stuart A. Kauffman [129], respectively, that the life process is an accelerator of the universal
evolutionary ﬂow, and that all forms of organization are modes of processing energies, to which we
can add many others e.g., [130,131].
9. Coda and Direct Tests

A proposed test for the model, as shown in Figure 2, should not be difﬁcult to the benchwork.
Since the prebiotic oligomers proposed to have started the DDPS are not known, a proxy would be
the readily available small RNAs than can self-aminoacylate [132,133] or the kinds of mini-tRNAs or
mini-helices that have been utilized as substitutes for the acceptor arm of tRNAs [32]. In both cases,
the oligomer sets should contain segments or loops that would provide the dimerization ability and
tails that would carry the amino acid. The terminal segments should be a main subject of creativity
in investigating structures and contexts adequate to facilitate the transferase reaction and mimic the
ribosomal, instead of the already observed terminal addition of amino acids. Evolution of the DDPS
process could be investigated through utilization of different compositions of the oligomers that will
dimerize and of the amino acids offered for acylation and peptide synthesis, plus the observation of
the rounds of syntheses and of the activity of precursor-product binding.
Transition to Biological Speciﬁcity

In the pre- or proto-biotic realm, the oligomers that would function as substrate carriers,
which include amino acids, and would be able to dimerize, the dimers functioning as peptidyl
transferase, are considered of unknown constitution. This indication derives from the unique lack
of hydropathy correlation between the ﬁrst set of encoded amino acids (Gly and Ser, module 1) and
their correspondent RNA anticodons (Figure 3). They are called pre- or proto-tRNAs only because the
present day molecules doing those jobs are the tRNAs in the ribosome. The term does not imply that

150

MDPI Books

Life 2017, 7, 16

they were structurally RNA-like but just says that they functionally preceded the tRNAs. The tRNAs
would have entered the system in module 2, together with enzyme speciﬁcity.
Any incursion into the pre-biotic geochemical realm faces great difﬁculties in view of the
distant time and the lack of fossil evidence. At least two kinds of hypotheses may be envisaged.
The RNA World conjecture [16] presents a main problem of requiring the prebiotic existence of the
highly complex nucleotides. Phosphate is not easy to obtain [134]. Sugars may be obtained from
formaldehyde oligomerization, but the outcome of the reactions is a complex mixture of many kinds
of compounds [135]. Nucleobases are obtained in concentrations about one thousand-fold lower than
amino acids [69,124]. Composition of the nucleotide structures with the precise RNA-type links would
almost certainly require enzyme catalysis, that is, they would have happened in already developed
(proto)cells. There is for sure a need for starting with simpler compounds. In this case, any hypothesis
that would lead to experimentation would at the same time create the additional problem of how
to move from the simpler oligomer to RNA. This transition should ideally be gradual, to attempt
to circumvent the problems of another transliteration or ‘translation’ system, as if reversing what
happens in cells.
In view of the difﬁculties in taking sides with respect to the RNA World proposition and together
with the possibility of the lack of hydropathy correlation with the dinucleotides being derived only
from the poorness of the encoded amino acid set—just two, probably amidst other amino acids or
other compounds polymerized together with them due to catalytic non-speciﬁcity—we prefer to say of
an unknown constitution of the carriers. We are not committed with the RNA World proposition and
cannot offer a justiﬁed alternative. Some of the commonly accepted pre-biotic supports and guides
for oligomerization reactions, e.g., from mineral surfaces such as clays [125], would be non-speciﬁc
enough to accept diverse kinds of monomers. Any choice among the possibilities would have to rely
upon robust experimentation.
How conﬁdent could we be on the validity of the rationale for the origins of the metabolic
maze? The path from simple to complex is not to be considered ‘the’ paradigm of evolution, but it
is appealing in view of having been reached here as a result, not having been taken as a premise or
assumption. There is apparently no way to get simpler, in both C1 sources and in the simplicity of
the C1-C4 Glycine-Serine Cycle. Methylotrophs bearing this pathway and mitochondrial ancestors
trace back to the same group, the α-proteobacteria, but this is not considered among extant relatives to
primitive or root organisms. Amino acids are precursors to sugars, through gluconeogenesis, and are
included in pathways for biosynthesis of nucleobases. Origins of bioenergetics pathways is presently
being directed to the autotrophic AcetylCoA pathway, which converges with the Glycine-Serine Cycle
core. Key co-factors in these are the (H4 )Pterins, main among these being the MethanoPterin and
Folate, while the AcetylCoA pathway is much richer in cofactor requirements. In this possibly highly
conﬂictive area, we remain.

Frozen Accident Pushing 50: Stereochemistry,
Expansion, and Chance in the Evolution of the
Genetic Code

Abstract: Nearly 50 years ago, Francis Crick propounded the frozen accident scenario for the
evolution of the genetic code along with the hypothesis that the early translation system consisted
primarily of RNA. Under the frozen accident perspective, the code is universal among modern life
forms because any change in codon assignment would be highly deleterious. The frozen accident can
be considered the default theory of code evolution because it does not imply any speciﬁc interactions
between amino acids and the cognate codons or anticodons, or any particular properties of the code.
The subsequent 49 years of code studies have elucidated notable features of the standard code, such
as high robustness to errors, but failed to develop a compelling explanation for codon assignments.
In particular, stereochemical afﬁnity between amino acids and the cognate codons or anticodons does
not seem to account for the origin and evolution of the code. Here, I expand Crick’s hypothesis on
RNA-only translation system by presenting evidence that this early translation already attained high
ﬁdelity that allowed protein evolution. I outline an experimentally testable scenario for the evolution
of the code that combines a distinct version of the stereochemical hypothesis, in which amino acids
are recognized via unique sites in the tertiary structure of proto-tRNAs, rather than by anticodons,
expansion of the code via proto-tRNA duplication, and the frozen accident.
Keywords: genetic code evolution; frozen accident; stereochemical theory; coevolution theory; error
minimization; RNA world; proto-tRNAs

1. Introduction

The time of this writing, early 2017, falls between two notable dates, the 100th anniversary
of Francis Crick’s birth and the 50th anniversary of Crick’s 1968 classic paper on the evolution of
the genetic code [1,2]. Compared to Crick’s momentous contribution to the understanding of DNA
structure and replication [3,4], and then the principles of protein translation [5,6], the code evolution
paper might seem to be almost inconsequential. Yet, this masterpiece of conceptual thinking presents
two ideas that have shaped the subsequent developments in the study of the code evolution and more
generally, the study of the early evolution of life. These ideas are the frozen accident perspective on
the code evolution and the inference of a RNA-only translation system.
The genetic code that deﬁnes the rules of translation from the 4-letter nucleic acid alphabet
to the 20-letter alphabet of proteins is arguably the single central informational invariant of all life
forms [6–9]. Indeed, notwithstanding multiple code variants that continue to emerge through the
study of protein coding in diverse life forms, the basic structure of the code and the majority of the
codon assignments are truly universal [10,11]. When the codon table was settled in 1965, distinct
patterns in the code begging for explanation became immediately apparent [9,12]. The 64 triplet
codons are neatly organized in sets of four or two, with the third base of a codon typically being

synonymous. The assignment of codons to amino acids across the code table is clearly non-random:
related amino acids typically occupy contiguous areas in the table. The second position of a codon is
the most important specificity determinant, and three of the four columns of the table encode related,
chemically similar amino acids. For example, all codons with a U in the second position correspond
to hydrophobic amino acids. It is obvious from the table itself that the code is robust to error, i.e.,
mutational and translation errors in synonymous positions (typically, the third position in a codon)
have no effect on the protein, whereas substitutions in the first position typically lead to incorporation
of an amino acid similar to the correct one, thus decreasing the damage [9]. Quantitative analyses of the
code using cost functions derived from physico-chemical properties of amino acids or their evolutionary
exchangeability have confirmed the exceptional robustness of the standard genetic code (SGC): the
probability to reach the same level of error minimization as in the SGC by random permutation of codons
is below 10−6 [10,13–15]. However, the SGC is far from being optimal because, given the enormous
overall number of possible codes (>1084 ), billions of variants are even more robust to error [10].
During the 49 years since the publication of Crick’s code evolution paper, extensive experimental
and theoretical research effort had aimed to develop a deﬁnitive scenario for the evolution of the code
that would account for its notable properties. Even if rarely coached that way, these studies can be
considered as attempts on falsiﬁcation of the frozen accident scenario. Although the features of the
code have been explored in detail and some aspects of its evolution seem to have been elucidated,
these efforts appear to fall short of a compelling refutation of the frozen accident.
In this concept article, I brieﬂy review the current understanding of the factors that determined
the universality of the SGC and the three main scenarios of the code evolution. I then sketch a new
scenario for code evolution, informed by comparative genomic analyses, that combines the idea of
a primordial stereochemcial code with the frozen accident perspective. As a disclaimer, I should note
that no attempt is made here on anything close to a comprehensive review of the research on the code
origin and evolution let alone the origin of life. The goal is to place the frozen accident concept into the
context of latest efforts in the ﬁeld and brieﬂy discuss some new ideas.
2. Why the Universal Code?

The genetic code is nearly universal in all extant life forms although limited deviations from
the SGC have been detected in many groups of organisms, particularly in organelles and parasitic
or endosymbiotic bacteria with highly reduced genomes [11,16,17]. The changes to the SGC follow
three distinct patterns: (i) reassignment of codons within the canonical set of 21 (including the stop
signal); (ii) loss (“unassignment”) of codons, and (iii) incorporation of new amino acids. Stop codons
are strongly over-represented among the code modiﬁcations. Of the 23 non-standard code variants
listed in a recent survey [11], there are 8 cases of stop codons being reassigned or acquired, 8 cases of
codon loss, and 10 reassignments of a codon from one amino acid to another. Given that there are only
three stop codons, the same changes to the code occurred in parallel in different groups of organisms.
At least two well-characterized non-canonical amino acids have been co-opted into the code,
namely, selenocysteine that is represented in varying sets of proteins in diverse organisms from all three
domains of life [18,19], and pyrrolysine, currently detected only in some archaea. The mechanisms
that lead to the incorporation of these two amino acids are completely different. Pyrrolysine is
accommodated via reassignment of a stop codon analogous to code changes within the canonical
amino acid set; in contrast, inclusion of selenocysteine involves recoding whereby a stop codon directs
selenocysteine incorporation only in the presence of a distinct, regulatory sequence element [20–22].
The evolutionary mechanisms that lead to codon reassignment and emergence of deviant codes
involve changes in tRNA speciﬁcity and/or evolution of new speciﬁcities in the case of stop codon
recruitment. These mechanisms ﬁt the general ‘gain and loss’ framework, where ‘gain’ refers to
acquisition of a new tRNA speciﬁcity, typically resulting from duplication of a tRNA gene, whereas
‘loss’ is elimination of a tRNA speciﬁcity, typically via deletion [11,23,24]. There is no evidence that any
modern code modiﬁcations are adaptive. Most likely, these change evolved neutrally, through genetic

159

drift and mutational pressure that drives small genomes toward high AT-content. The single key
feature to be emphasized regarding the extant code variants is that they are all minor, i.e., involve one
or at most two reassignments per variant, and typically concern rare amino acids, such as reassigning
tryptophane (the least abundant amino acid of all) to a stop codon, the most common change that
occurred in parallel in several deviant codes. The variant code does not venture far from the SGC at all.
Notably, new methods of synthetic biology have recently allowed substantial artiﬁcial alteration
of the code in bacteria [25–28]. Although the ﬁtness of the bacteria with altered codes has not been
thoroughly studied, their viability itself seems to support the view that the ﬁtness of different codes
might not differ dramatically, so that the (near) universality of the SGC is likely to stem from high
ﬁtness barriers separating it from other codes, or in other words, low ﬁtness of the intermediates [11].
To account for the universality of the code, Crick came up with the frozen accident argument:
“This theory states that the code is universal because at the present time any change would be lethal,
or at least very strongly selected against. This is because in all organisms (with the possible exception
of certain viruses) the code determines (by reading the mRNA) the amino acid sequences of so many
highly evolved protein molecules that any change to these would be highly disadvantageous unless
accompanied by many simultaneous mutations to correct the “mistakes” produced by altering the
code. This accounts for the fact that the code does not change. To account for it being the same in all
organisms one must assume that all life evolved from a single organism (more strictly, from a single
closely interbreeding population). In its extreme form, the theory implies that the allocation of codons
to amino acids at this point was entirely a matter of “chance”.” [1].
Using the language of ﬁtness landscapes, the frozen accident perspective implies that there can be
many different codes occupying ﬁtness peaks, but they are separated by deep valleys of low ﬁtness [15]
(Figure 1). As indicated above, all discovered codon reassignments in extant organisms are indeed
quite limited in scope. Moreover, in agreement with Crick’s reasoning, these modiﬁcations have been
identiﬁed primarily in organelles and bacteria with small genomes where the damage from reassigning
rare codons could have been tolerable (contrary to what Crick thought, the code apparently does not
change in viruses because these employ the host translation machinery for decoding their mRNAs).
The frozen accident argument does not necessarily require that the original choice of codon assignment
is literally and strictly random. Various factors could have contributed to the initial codon assignments
(see discussion below) but once the choice is made, it gets frozen, i.e., only rare and minor changes
may be allowed.

As Crick points out, the universality of the code is perhaps the strongest evidence of the existence
of LUCA (Last Universal Cellular Ancestor), along with the universal conservation of the translation
machinery [29]. However, LUCA certainly was not the ﬁrst life form and most likely, not even the
ﬁrst cellular organism, only an evolutionary bottleneck. The early stages of cellular and especially
pre-cellular evolution must have been dramatically different from the post-LUCA evolution of cellular
organisms. This early evolution is thought to have involved competition between ensembles of
“virus-like” genetic elements and selection at the level of such collectives [30–32]. Translation hardly
could have evolved literally within a single such ensemble, and if it emerged on multiple occasions in
different ensembles, then, initially, numerous, different codes must have existed. Then, why only one
frozen accident, assuming that the actual codon assignments are indeed (quasi) accidental? To put it
even more generally, why a single LUCA only?
A strikingly simple but, I believe, compelling answer was given by Vetsigian, Woese, and
Goldenfeld in a breakthrough 2006 paper [33]: only one code survived because extensive horizontal
gene transfer (HGT) was an aspect of early evolution without which the transition to the cellular level
of complexity would not have been possible. Even a small change in the code has a prohibitive effect
on HGT. Vetsigian and colleagues developed a simple mathematical model to track evolution with and
without HGT. Starting with a random ensemble of codes, their simulated evolution experiments led
to increased coded diversity in the absence of HGT but to survival of only a few code variants when
HGT was allowed. In the original study, Vetsigian and coworkers explored a deterministic model in
an inﬁnite population approximation [33]. Notably, recent modeling efforts that took into account
stochastic effects of the ﬁnite population size produced a single, universal code, with a structure similar
to that of the SGC, within a range of HGT rates [34,35].
Given that HGT, even if limited by both physical and selective barriers, remained a key factor
of microbial evolution [36–40], and apparently, a condition for long term survival of microbial
populations [41,42], it stands to reason that it played a key role not only in the primordial
universalization of the code but also in its maintenance through nearly four billion years of cellular
evolution. The demonstration of the essential role of the code universality in the exchange of genetic
information that promotes evolution of life arguably was one of the most important insights in the
code evolution ﬁeld since Crick’s hypothesis. Conceivably, frozen accident and the requirement of
HGT were major, complementary factors that have kept the code universal.
3. The Three Principal Scenarios of the Code Origin and Evolution: Achievements, Limitations,
and Compatibility

The structure of the SGC, i.e., the mapping of 64 codons to 20 amino acids and the stop signal,
is clearly non-random by multiple criteria [9,10]. This non-randomness of the code seems to require
an explanation(s). The three major concepts that strive to explain the regularities in the code are the
stereochemical, coevolution, and error minimization ‘theories’ [10,43,44]. A detailed review of the
current state of these scenarios for code evolution is presented elsewhere [45]; here, I only give a brief
synopsis and assessment of their contributions to our current understanding of the code evolution.
The stereochemical theory postulates that the structure of the code is determined by
physicoo-chemical afﬁnity between amino acids and codons or anticodons. The initial attempts
on direct experimental demonstration of interaction between amino acids and the cognate triplets
have been generally unconvincing [46]. In these early days of the study of code evolution, molecular
modeling has been used to propose a variety of ‘stereochemical codes’ based on interactions of amino
acids with cognate codons [47], reversed codons [48], anticodons [49], codon-anticodon duplexes [50],
or a complex of four nucleotides including the anticodon and an additional base [51]. The difﬁculty of
discriminating between different models and the lack of solid experimental support prevented any of
these schemes from becoming the explanatory framework for the evolution of the code.
The stereochemical theory has been given a new life by the progress of the aptamer technology.
At least some amino acids have been shown to select sequences signiﬁcantly enriched for either codons

161

MDPI Books

Life 2017, 7, 22

or anticodons [52–55]. These results were taken as evidence of existence of an early stereochemical era
in the code evolution during which the majority of the modern amino acids have been co-opted into
the code [56]. However, as discussed elsewhere [10,45], the stereochemical evidence does not appear to be
compelling. The principal problems are two-fold. First, statistically significant affinity for cognate triplets
has been demonstrated only for five amino acids, and the triplet could be either codon or anticodon [55].
Second, and more damning, all the results of aptamer experiments that appear compatible with the
physico-chemical affinity between amino acids and cognate triplets pertain to complex amino acids that
are unlikely to have been available at the time of the code emergence (see next Section).
The second theory, known as coevolution, holds that the genetic code is shaped by the
precursor-product relationships between amino acids [57–60]. Under the coevolution scenario, the code
evolved from an ancestral version that included only the simple amino acids that can be produced
abiogenically (see next section) by expanding to incorporate the more complex amino acids, in parallel
with the evolution of the respective biosynthetic pathways (hence coevolution—between the code
and the amino acid biosynthesis pathways). The importance of biosynthetic pathways for the code
evolution is effectively obvious because amino acids could not be incorporated into the code unless
they were available. The coevolution theory holds that the code evolved by subdivision of large
blocks of codons that in the ancestral code encoded the same amino acid but were split to encode two
(or more) amino acids upon the evolution of the respective metabolic pathways. The speciﬁc pattern
of codon reassignment would be determined by the precursor-product relationships between amino
acids. Thus, the coevolution theory cannot be reduced to the self-evident statement on the importance
of biosynthetic pathways for the inclusion of the late amino acids into the code. Rather, the theory
makes speciﬁc and readily falsiﬁable predictions on the subdivision of the primordial blocks of codons
assignments following the evolution of metabolic pathways. As shown within the framework of the
third theory of code evolution, these inferences do not seem to hold very well.
The grouping of similar amino acids within the same column of the code table immediately
indicates that the code has a degree of robustness to mutational and translational errors. In other
words, the codon assignments are organized in such a way as to minimize the deleterious effect of such
errors. Hence the error minimization theory of code evolution, under which the structure of the code
is determined by selection for robustness to errors. Extensive quantitative analyses that employed cost
functions differently derived from physico-chemical properties of amino acids have shown that the
code is indeed highly resilient, with the probability to pick an equally robust random code being on the
order of 10−7 –10−8 [14,15,61–68]. Obviously, however, among the ~1084 possible random codes, there
is a huge number with a higher degree of error minimization than the SGC. Furthermore, the SGC is
not a local peak on the code ﬁtness landscape because certain local rearrangements can increase the
level of error minimization; a quantitatively, the SGC is positioned roughly halfway from an average
random code to the summit of the corresponding local peak [15] (Figure 1).
The typical conclusion of the error minimization theorists is that the code evolved under selective
pressure for robustness. However, this conclusion is not necessarily justiﬁed. Most if not all code
optimization analyses focus on rearrangements of the standard code table, which allows formal (and
in itself, valid, given the cost function) estimation of robustness but not the evolutionary processes that
lead to it. A more biologically sound approach involves reconstruction of the routes of code expansion
that might produce error minimization as a selectively neutral byproduct of evolution driven by other
factors [64,67,68].
To conclude this brief discussion of the three major scenarios for the evolution of the code, it is
useful to note that, although stemming from widely different premises, there is no reason why these
scenarios should be mutually exclusive. Quite the contrary, stereochemistry, biochemical coevolution,
and selection for error minimization could have contributed synergistically at different stages of the
evolution of the code [43]—along with frozen accident.

4. Primordial Expansion of the Code

Life 2017, 7, 22

Little as we can claim to actually know about the evolution of the code, it appears most likely that
the earliest proteins contained fewer amino acids than the modern set of 20. The canonical amino acids
differ substantially in terms chemical complexity and stability. Ten amino acids have been consistently
identiﬁed in prebiotic chemistry experiments as well as in in meteorites, in the following order of
abundance: Gly, Ala, Asp, Glu, Val, Ser, Ile, Leu, Pro, Thr [69–72]. Notably, the recent, perhaps most
promising at this time prebiotic chemistry experiments, based on hydrogen cyanide photochemistry,
that yield precursors of ribonucleotides and amino acids, also primarily produce amino acids from the
above list, namely, Gly, Ala, Ser, and Thr [73,74]. The ranks of amino acids in the ‘early’ list positively
and significantly correlate with the free energy of their synthesis: the amino acids that are on top of the
list are the ‘cheapest’ energetically [75]. An independent approach that involved analysis of the fluxes
of amino acids in recent evolution of proteins in diverse organisms shows that the concentrations of the
putative early amino acids in the above list are mostly decreasing, whereas those of the late amino acids
are increasing [76]. This convergence of widely different methods of inference suggests that the above
10 amino acids can be confidently considered old, i.e., were represented already in the first proteins [77].
Given the conﬁdently derived consensus set of ancient amino acids and the unavailability of the
late amino acids before complex biosynthetic pathways evolved (see discussion of the coevolution
theory above), early expansion of the code appears to be inevitable. The idea of such expansion again
goes back to Crick’s seminal paper: “The next general point about the primitive code is that it seems
likely that only a few amino acids were involved” [1]. More importantly, Crick proposed, if not quite
explicitly, that the error minimization property of the code could have evolved as consequence of the
code expansion: “the net effect of a whole series of such changes would be that similar amino acids
would tend to have similar codons, which is just what we observe in the present code” [1].
The theme of evolution of error minimization as a neutral consequence, or by-product, of the code
expansion has been thoroughly developed in several recent studies [64,67,68]. Massey explored three
distinct scenarios of the code expansion: the “2-1-3” model [78], which is similar to expansion schemes
independently proposed by Higgs [79] and Francis [80], the ambiguity reduction model [81] and
precursor-product scenario speciﬁed by the coevolution theory [57,59]. The 2-1-3 model and similar
schemes posit that the code started from an ancestral stage, in which only the second base of the codon
was informative, and expanded by assigning speciﬁcity to the ﬁrst, and then, in some codon series,
the third bases (another idea that goes back to Crick’s 1968 paper). Under the ambiguity reduction
model, in the ancestral code, codon series ambiguously encoded groups of amino acids, such that the
subsequent evolution involved gradual increase in the speciﬁcity of the codon-amino acid mapping.
The evolutionary simulations with both the 2-1-3 model and the ambiguity reduction model readily
yield codes with error minimization levels exceeding that of the SGC. In contrast, the coevolution
model, although producing some level of error minimization, was substantially inferior to the other
scenarios, as also demonstrated in an earlier analysis by Higgs [79]. These ﬁndings cast doubt on the
direct relevance of coevolution model [57,59] and imply that, although substantial error minimization
is a key property of the SGC, this feature likely evolved as a by-product of code expansion rather than
by direct selection for code robustness.
5. Protein Evolution Paradox, Extinct Primordial Stereochemical Code, Expansion of the Code,
and Frozen Accident: A Coevolution Scenario for the Code and the Translation System

The origin and evolution of the translation system is a forbiddingly difﬁcult problem, and
therefore, in many studies on the code evolution, it is formally treated as a separate issue and
approached almost like a mathematical puzzle [9]. Ultimately, however, it appears virtually certain
that evolution of the code can be understood only in the context of the evolution of translation, as
presciently noted by Crick: “It is almost impossible to discuss the origin of the code without discussing
the origin of the actual biochemical mechanisms of protein synthesis” [1].

The translation system is universally conserved among the extant cellular life forms but many
protein components of the translation apparatus, as well as the tRNAs, are paralogs, and furthermore,
belong to large paralogous families. Phylogenetic analysis of such families can provide clues to the
pre-LUCA phase of evolution. The results of such analyses reveal a ‘protein evolution paradox’.
The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS), the enzymes that are responsible for the accurate matching
between amino acids and the cognate codons in the modern translation system, belong to two classes
of paralogs, with 10 speciﬁcities in each [82,83]. As convincingly demonstrated for the Class I aaRS
that contain a Rossmann-fold catalytic domain, the diversiﬁcation of the aaRS occurred at a late
stage in the evolution of the Rossmann-fold protein superfamily [84,85]. By the time the 10 Class I
aaRS speciﬁcities evolved via radiation from a common ancestor, the evolution of the Rossmann fold
superfamily had already produced a substantial diversity of other enzymatic and nucleotide-binding
domains. A similar scenario holds for the evolution of the Class II aaRS, which belong to the biotin
synthase superfamily, although the evolution of these proteins has not been explored as thoroughly
as that of Class I [86,87]. For this early protein evolution to occur, high-ﬁdelity (although possibly
not to the level of the modern system) translation was certainly essential, and given that the different
aaRS speciﬁcities have not yet evolved, the conclusion inevitably ensues that the speciﬁcity of amino
acid-codon correspondence was determined by RNA molecules [88].
The conclusion that the mRNA decoding in the early translation system was performed by
RNA molecules, conceivably, evolutionary precursors of modern tRNAs (proto-tRNAs) [89], implies
a stereochemical model of code origin and evolution, but one that differs from the traditional models
of this type in an important way (Figure 2). Under this model, the proto-RNA-amino acid interactions
that defined the specificity of translation would not involve the anticodon (let alone codon) that therefore
could be chosen arbitrarily and fixed through frozen accident. Instead, following the reasoning outlined
previously [90], the amino acids would be recognized by unique pockets in the tertiary structure of the
proto-tRNAs. The clustering of codons for related amino acids naturally follows from code expansion
by duplication of the proto-tRNAs; the molecules resulting from such duplications obviously would be
structurally similar and accordingly would bind similar amino acids, resulting in error minimization,
in accord with Crick’s proposal (Figure 2). A variant of this scenario would involve initial imprecise
recognition of groups of amino acids (e.g., several bulky hydrophobic ones) followed by duplication and
subfunctionalization of the proto-tRNAs, recapitulating Woese’s statistical protein hypothesis [91]. This part
of the scenario represents code expansion discussed above that could have been driven by the benefits of
diversification of the repertoire of protein amino acids and would yield robustness as a byproduct.
The transition from the primordial, RNA only translation system to the modern RNA-protein
machinery would follow the previously outlined path [90,92], in which the ﬁrst translated peptides
would serve as cofactors for the ribozymes, in particular, the proto-tRNAs (Figure 3). At the next
stage, the ancestral catalytic domains of the aaRS would evolve and take over from the proto-tRNA as
the catalysts for the aminoacylation reaction. Initially, each of these domains would indiscriminately
catalyze aminoacylation of 10 proto-tRNAs. The subsequent evolution would involve duplication of the
catalytic domains and accretion of accessory domains, resulting in the emergence of protein-mediated
determination of aminoacylation speciﬁcity (Figure 3).
Once the amino acid speciﬁcity determinants shifted from the proto-tRNAs to the aaRS, the
amino acid-binding pockets in the (proto) tRNAs deteriorated such that modern tRNAs showed no
consistent afﬁnity to the cognate amino acids. This scenario implies that attempts to decipher the
primordial stereochemical code by comparative analysis of modern translation system components are
largely futile. The best hope for reconstructing the ancient code could lie in experiments on in vitro
evolution of speciﬁc aminoacylating ribozymes that can be evolved quite easily and themselves seem
to recapitulate a key aspect of the primordial translation system [93–95]. It seems interesting to note
that, although direct recognition of amino acids by RNA molecules seems to be banished from the
modern translation system, it survives in other functional spheres of modern cells, in particular, as

164

amino acid-binding riboswitches [96,97]. The structures of such riboswitches complexed with the
cognate amino acids might shed light on the structures of primordial proto-tRNAs.

Figure 2. Putative primordial stereochemical code, evolution by code expansion and the standard
code as frozen accident. Related amino acid (AA) are shown by similar colors. In the code expansion
phase, the anticodons are shown changed in the third position (corresponding to the ﬁrst position of
the codon), resulting in recruitment of related amino acids.

Figure 3. Transition from the RNA only to modern-type RNA-protein translation system. Two phases
of evolution between the primordial, RNA only translation and the modern-type system are envisaged.
At the ﬁrst intermediate stage, peptides (denoted P) synthesized by the primitive translation system
would serve as cofactors for amino acid binding and aminoacylation, and at the second stage, catalysis
of aminoacylation would be relegated to catalytic aminoacylating domains (denoted AAD). Two forms
of both the cofactor peptides and the AAD are shown, to provide continuity towards the two classes
of aaRS.

6. Concluding Remarks

MDPI Books

Life 2017, 7, 22

Five decades after the publication of Crick’s seminal paper [1], frozen accident remains alive and
well, and a major tenet of our thinking on the evolution of the code. It could be argued that frozen
accident is not a theory and not even a hypothetical scenario but rather a meaningless non-explanation
of the code origin. Although any detailed discussion on epistemology is beyond the scope of this
article, I counter that random and (extremely) rare events are part and parcel of the evolution of
life, even if this is unpalatable to some on philosophical grounds [88,98,99]. Thus, frozen accident
actually is a falsiﬁable null hypothesis. The falsiﬁcation of the frozen accident comes in the form
of positive evidence of speciﬁc evolutionary processes that account for certain aspects of the code
evolution. However, none of the three major theories of the code evolution has been fully successful
in providing a deﬁnitive explanation although each has highlighted important features of the code.
By combining ﬁndings from evolutionary analysis of translation system components, a distinct ﬂavor
of the stereochemical theory—the concept of the code expansion that is well grounded in data and
theory—and the frozen accident idea, a simple, experimentally testable model of code evolution is
proposed here. It owes most of the underlying ideas to Crick’s 1968 paper and the concurrent work of
Carl Woese.

Abstract: The identity/recognition of tRNAs, in the context of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (and other
molecules), is a complex phenomenon that has major implications ranging from the origins and
evolution of translation machinery and genetic code to the evolution and speciation of tRNAs
themselves to human mitochondrial diseases to artiﬁcial genetic code engineering. Deciphering it via
laboratory experiments, however, is difﬁcult and necessarily time- and resource-consuming. In this
study, we propose a mathematically rigorous two-pronged in silico approach to identifying and
classifying tRNA positions important for tRNA identity/recognition, rooted in machine learning and
information-theoretic methodology. We apply Bayesian Network modeling to elucidate the structure
of intra-tRNA-molecule relationships, and distribution divergence analysis to identify meaningful
inter-molecule differences between various tRNA subclasses. We illustrate the complementary
application of these two approaches using tRNA examples across the three domains of life,
and identify and discuss important (informative) positions therein. In summary, we deliver to
the tRNA research community a novel, comprehensive methodology for identifying the speciﬁc
elements of interest in various tRNA molecules, which can be followed up by the corresponding
experimental work and/or high-resolution position-speciﬁc statistical analyses.
Keywords: tRNA identity; tRNA recognition; operational code; bayesian networks; information
theory; distribution divergence

1. Introduction

A prototypical tRNA is a compact and ubiquitous molecule. Its primary function is that of an
adapter mediating mRNA and growing protein sequence; as such, together with aminoacyl tRNA
synthetases (aaRSes), tRNAs form the backbone of translation apparatus and embody the genetic code.
In order to be effective, translation machinery requires unambiguous charging of tRNA molecules by
the appropriate amino acids (“aa”); this, somewhat whimsically, is known as “second genetic code”
(see [1] and references therein). It is the aaRSes that are physically responsible for charging tRNAs
with amino acids.
What are the factors that determine the identity of tRNAs with respect to these pairings? How,
exactly, is the “correct” tRNA recognized and aminoacetylated by cognate aaRS? It is reasonable
to assume that this speciﬁcity is encoded in the tRNA molecule proper (perhaps localized around
certain tRNA regions) and is then reﬂected in its 3D structure and chemical properties. Identifying
such determinants and antideterminants (that, conversely, prevent incorrect recognition) within tRNA

molecules is far from trivial, yet is of signiﬁcant theoretical and practical importance (see [2] for
an overview).
The straightforward approach to elucidating tRNA determinants and antideterminants would
be via experimental work. This constitutes primarily combinatorial screening, where many tRNA
mutants are checked for interaction with aaRSes. Speciﬁc combinations of nucleotide polymorphisms
that correlate with changes in interaction status of tRNAs with cognate aaRSes are then noted. Intense
experimental effort along the above lines led to identifying some such tRNA sequence features that are
therefore assumed to be key elements of the “second genetic code” ([2]). These experimental efforts
are ongoing ([3,4] and references therein). It should also be noted that, gratifyingly, our understanding
of the underlying chemistry of amino acid activation is improving ([5,6]); recent progress in molecular
dynamic simulations had also added to our insight into the tRNA – aaRS fundamental biology
(see [7] for an overview). On a side note, much research had been done on the variability in the
aaRSes themselves ([8,9]). This has substantial practical implications (see Datt and Sharma [10] for an
overview of disease-associated aaRS mutation spectra).
However, our general grasp of the tRNA “determinant array” is very fragmented, at best. We can
only speculate as to the completeness, universality and robustness of discovered determinants (single
and multiple tRNA nucleotide polymorphisms) within the “second genetic code” context. To put it
bluntly, we lack systemic approach to the problem.
Experimental approaches are very time- and resource-consuming. While “targeted evolution”
of both tRNAs and aaRSes is technologically feasible ([11,12]) and happens to be of much practical
importance (see [13] for a mt-tRNA mitochondrial multi-system disorder example), the direction in
which such experimental work is pursued is often arbitrarily, if not anecdotally, mapped out.
Here, we propose a novel in silico approach for inferring important tRNA positions and features.
Our methodology of choice is Bayesian (or Belief) Network (BN) modeling, which has been used
by us ([14,15]) and others before in the domains with similar data structure. This methodology is
augmented by estimation of the distribution divergence metrics for the tRNA positions, across different
tRNA subclasses (subgroups), an information-theoretic approach. The primary data is a compendium
of tRNA nucleotide sequences (of which there are many thousands presently available), coupled
with both biological/chemical information (crystallographic data, biochemical behavior, etc.) and
ontological data (existing large body of work reﬂected in recent literature on various aspects of tRNA
chemistry, biology, evolution, and signiﬁcance in general).
Our two main goals throughout this study were to (i) further improve the BN methodology
(including both algorithms and software), predominantly in testing its generalization to novel data sets
and types; and to (ii) gain better tools for identifying tRNA determinants (and studying tRNA evolution
in general). The former is largely outside of the scope of this communication; we will concentrate on
the latter. As our approach was purely data-driven, the rationale was to infer “interesting” (the most
structurally important) positions/features of tRNAs regardless of the biological context. However, we
have also followed up with the discussion of the discovered positions of interest using ontological
(literature) knowledge. It should be noted that, as always in biology (and especially in the case
of tRNAs), any “feature of interest” exists largely in the evolutionary sense, which was a constant
consideration throughout the analyses and discussion of the results presented here.
In this study, we used a systems biology/probabilistic inference methodology (BNs) that in our
opinion is well suited for the task; it is detailed elsewhere ([14,15]), but the rationale is brieﬂy covered
below in Materials and Methods. By applying BN analysis to the tRNA sequence data, we were able
to recognize the interplay of structurally and biologically important features of the tRNA molecule.
Furthermore, by extending the analysis to distribution divergence estimates across all tRNA positions
and different tRNA subclasses, we were able to single out the important positions speciﬁc to each type
of tRNA, which led us to identifying tRNA determinants and antideterminants.

Building tRNA probabilistic networks, as well as evolutionary studies of tRNAs in general, require
assembling a reliable tRNA sequence alignment as the initial step. Resulting BNs are dependent on
both the alignment and the number of sequences involved; more accurate alignment and higher
number of sequences being of course desirable. In this study, we went to the tRNAdb database as a
primary source ([16]); 9758 unambiguously aligned tRNA sequences were imported.
Each vertical position in the alignment is interpreted as a random variable with values ranging
over all possible nucleotide states at this position in the tRNAs in the alignment. In other words, each
vertical position is a discrete random variable with a number (label) assigned. These labels, or variable
names, are thus invariant for all tRNA molecules. To avoid confusion with position numbering,
Figure 1 depicts the layout of consensus tRNA sequence. The ﬁrst row corresponds to the numbering
scheme adopted throughout most of this study; position numbers in the ﬁrst row are also the variable
(node) names in the BNs. This is a universally accepted tRNA numbering standard ([17]). The master,
or majority consensus, tRNA sequence (second row in Figure 1) contains notable fragments of tRNA
molecule colored in red (acceptor stem), green (D-arm), blue (anticodon 131 arm) and yellow (T-arm).
The same color scheme is used in the resulting BNs. Therefore, by consulting Figure 1 when evaluating
these study results, it is easy to visually link to the speciﬁc positions and sections of the tRNA molecule.

Figure 1. tRNA sequence alignment. The ﬁrst row corresponds to the “standard” numbering scheme.
The second row is the consensus sequence. Structural parts of tRNA molecules are highlighted in color
(see text for details).

Given the tRNA alignment, a BN, also formally known as PDAG (probabilistic directed acyclic
graph), can be learned from it. Dependencies (intra-tRNA position interactions represented by the
BN edges; they can also be colloquially thought of as “correlations” or “linkage” or “associations”
between positions) suggested by the BN can subsequently be evaluated against a set of well-known
structural features of tRNA. The purpose of doing so (building the BN and observing signiﬁcant
dependencies, as reﬂected by the network edges) is two-fold: to identify yet unknown but potentially
interesting interactions, and to observe deviations from the established models. In a tRNA BN, network
nodes correspond to the variables representing vertical positions in tRNA alignment, edges—to the
dependencies between these variables. For a fuller understanding of BN representation, notions of
conditional independence, edge directionality and strength, BN equivalence classes, and Markov
neighborhood (or “blanket”) of a node are useful; however, detailed theoretical treatment is outside
the scope of this communication (see [15,18,19]). Brieﬂy, BN is a graphical model of a joint multivariate
probability distribution of random (both continuous and discrete) variables that reﬂects relationships
of dependence and conditional independence among them. Absence of an edge between two nodes
(variables) indicates conditional independence. Directionality of the edge (arrow) is, in this (tRNA)
case, for mathematical convenience only and does not imply causation ﬂow. Dependency (edge)
strength can also be estimated; it should be interpreted as a relative support for the strength of a
relationships between the variables. No absolute interpretation, such as p-value, is possible before
the follow-up parametric statistical analysis; however, edge strengths can be directly compared to
one another within a BN. Edge strengths are shown as numbers (next to the corresponding edges in
the BN ﬁgures) that can be thought of as the likelihood ratios (marginal likelihood given the data, or
model ﬁt, of the BN with the edge present divided by the marginal likelihood of the BN with the edge
absent). Local probability tables (conditional probabilities) can be estimated for pairwise frequency
173

calculations between the two nodes; by observing these frequencies, we can, for example, speculate on
the nature of different nucleotide pairings at different tRNA positions (e.g., whether they are canonical
Watson–Crick pairings or not).
Parsing local probability tables can become cumbersome for the nodes with more than one or two
edges; the problem is exacerbated when conditioning by the amino acid (or other tRNA subgroup
stratiﬁcation) is introduced. This is why we have also decided to complement the BN modeling with
the simpler information theoretic-based pairwise analyses of the tRNA sequence data conditioned on
the tRNA subclass variables, notably the amino acid variable. BN modeling remains the method of
choice for higher-order abstraction; for scrutinizing tRNA position relationships at a ﬁner level (and in
smaller, for example stratiﬁed by amino acid, tRNA datasets), such pairwise comparisons (utilizing
distribution divergence) might be more practical and statistically robust.
It remains to note that the actual BN search algorithm used by us was an iterative gradient
method with restarts, and MDL (Minimum Description Length) was chosen as a model scoring
criterion. Multinomial local probability model with four nucleotide states was used. Further technical
details of our current BN modeling implementation can be found in [15,20]. Various BN reconstruction
algorithm parameter adjustments were tried based on our previous experience with BNs (results not
shown); the resulting BNs proved to be sufﬁciently robust. Our BN modeling software is directly
available from the authors.
3. Results
3.1. Structural Information

The complete tRNA BN (using all tRNAdb sequences pooled together) is shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2a is the “ﬂattened” visualization that makes it easier to trace speciﬁc position dependencies.
Figure 2b shows the same graph superimposed on the cloverleaf tRNA structure, for easier “biological”
visualization. The interpretation of the dependencies (links, edges) between the tRNA positions in
the network is necessarily equivocal—a dependency might have different (one or more) biological
interpretations. Some of these dependencies, such as the ones directly explained by chemical bonds
and physical interactions, are more straightforward and obvious. However, even these can be partially
obscured by the probabilistic nature of BN reconstruction.
We will ﬁrst consider the dependencies related to the secondary structure of tRNA. For example,
in the acceptor stem, positions 1, 7 are linked with positions 72, 66, respectively; positions 10, 13 are
linked with 25, 22 in D-arm; positions 27, 31 are linked with 43, 39 in anticodon arm; positions 49, 53 are
linked with positions 66, 61 in the T-arm. These connections are expected and provide a solid point of
reference (and a positive control, especially if one takes into account relative connection strengths) for
further BN interpretation. Clearly, the BN modeling is able to identify structural relationships inherent
to the secondary cloverleaf structure. At this point, we were curious if the procedure was also capable
of suggesting principal tertiary structure interactions (known from the literature). The following
relationships proved to be of particular interest:
First, note the interaction between position 26 and 44. These are often associated with a
non-Watson–Crick pairing (usually GA, with the last base change from 33 degree to 45 degree angle).
Then, a parallel base pair interaction is indicated between position 15 in the d-loop and position
48 in the variable loop (bringing the D-loop and the variable loop together in the 3D conﬁguration).
A reverse Hoogsteen pairing is indicated with position 8 and position 14; it is known that this
interaction, together with positions 15 and 48, is responsible for the linkage of the two main domains
of tRNA molecule in the l-shaped conﬁguration via precise docking of the D- and T psi C-arms).
It should be noted that, although all four of these positions are largely invariant (or semi-invariant),
the BN methodology is able to elucidate their relationships and suggest how all of them are linked
together in maintaining the l-shaped structures of tRNA molecules. This is not surprising, considering
that BN analysis is very sensitive to rare events ([15,20]. The latter are often ignored altogether in

174

MDPI Books

Life 2018, 8, 5

traditional statistical analyses (as well as in common classiﬁcation algorithms, such as single decision
trees in machine learning). Indeed, once a p-value (or, correspondingly, a decision tree classiﬁcation
decision) is generated, the rare event is simply no longer visible in the analysis schema; however,
BN reconstruction process often creates an additional (comparatively weak) edge instead of just
disregarding the “minority report” of a rare event. In such cases, low conﬁdence in the edge (reﬂected
as relatively low edge strength, as measured by the model marginal likelihood ratio) points to a rarity
of the event (a particular tRNA mutation, in this context) rather than the statistical insigniﬁcance of
the relationship.
Additionally, a triple base interaction is suggested between positions 9, 23 and 13. Another triple
base interaction between 13, 22 and 46 is related to docking the variable loop onto the D-arm. However,
another important interaction occurs between the D- and C-loops (link between G18G19 of D-loop with
position 55c56). The BN shows the interactions between positions 18, 19, and 56, but not position 55.
All of these relationships, highlighted by the BN, are essential to the determination of the core tertiary
structure of the tRNA molecule. This is gratifying in itself; however, even a superﬁcial glance at the
Figure 2 reveals many more potential relationships in addition to what has been so far reported in
the literature (which largely revolves around the intricacies of the tertiary structure determination
and interactions).
Before following up on these potential relationships, however, one question that must be asked
is whether the BN “overﬁts” the data (i.e., suggests spurious relationships reﬂecting random noise
and data analysis artifacts). We have studied the question extensively in the broader BN modeling
context ([14,15]). By using entropy-based model selection (and BN scoring) criteria, we can explicitly
adjust the overﬁtting/underﬁtting balance (i.e., penalize less/more for the network complexity).
The BN reconstruction engine used throughout this study was tuned more towards “underﬁtting”,
meaning that if the edge appears in the BN visualization, our conﬁdence in it is sufﬁciently high
(in other words, “if the edge is present, there is deﬁnitely something”). What the BN reconstruction
doe, is simply underscores, agnostically, all information patterns contained in the data. Therefore,
in our analyses of the results shown in Figure 2, it would behoove us to go beyond secondary and
tertiary structure interpretations.
For example, consider the interplay between the positions 9, 12, 13, 22, 23 and 46. The “triple”
interaction between 9, 27, 23 and 13, 22, 46 has been reported before. However, in addition to that, we
observe a more complex pattern of interactions that hinges on position 9. We can say that position 9
is dependent on the state of position 13 (or 22, which is tightly linked to 13) and position 23 (or 12,
which is tightly linked to 23). Which of these alternatives reﬂects the actual biological (mechanistic)
relationship? We cannot tell from the BN alone; all we know is that the likelihood of 9-13 is slightly
higher than that of 9-22 (and the likelihood of 9-23 is slightly higher than 9-12). However, this might be
a sampling artifact. However, in any case, the BN suggests that there is a “global” pattern of interaction
between all ﬁve nucleotides. Further untangling of the underlying biology would be an example of
promising direction of laboratory research. One possible interpretation is that the crystal structures,
in general, point to one speciﬁc conﬁguration (the crystallized form) whereas in solution more than
one tRNA structure can dynamically exist. tRNAs are ﬂexible polymers, and what we see depicted in
the BN are the multiple interactions that occur during small structural rearrangements of the molecule
in vivo (and recall that BN modeling is particularly revealing of rare events/variants). These can reﬂect
the ﬂuctuations around the minimum free energy structure (often but not always the crystallized
form)—or the phenomenon could be due to the alternative structures related to speciﬁc biological
functions (e.g., conformational changes due to interaction with other molecules, such as ribosomes or
aaRSes). Either way, more laboratory research is deﬁnitely indicated for this particular position cluster.
In general, it is our opinion that one could look at the tRNA molecule as a system (of
interactions)—if so, the BN (such as in Figure 2) is a synthetic representation of this system, where a
change in one base pair would affect numerous other positions either due to direct chemical interactions,
or because it will alter the global stability of the molecule.

Nodes in the network correspond to the variables (speciﬁcally, tRNA positions, as enumerated in

proportional to the dependency strength, also indicated by the number shown next to the edge. See
text for BN construction details. (Label “100” does not refer to a tRNA position but rather is a placeholder

To illustrate this outlook, let us revisit the interplay of the positions 12, 13, 22 and 23 at the far end
of the d-arm close to the d-loop. The links between positions 12, 23 and 13, 22 are what we expect to see
with the d-arm formation in the canonical cloverleaf tRNA structure. Interpretation of the connections
12, 13 and 22, 23, however, is not immediately obvious. A closer inspection of the BN, local probability
tables, and tRNA alignments reveals that positions 13, 22 do not always form a canonical Watson–Crick
(GU) pairing; sometimes, it is instead the two adenine residues that cannot pair. This means that the
d-domain, in a subset of the tRNA molecules, presents a shorter arm and a larger loop. Analysis of
the BN local probability tables reveals that in order to accommodate this structural variation (with a
shorter and therefore less stable arm) positions 12, 23 have to simultaneously change from AT to the
higher energy GC, to maintain the sufﬁcient structure stability.
In other words, what the BN analysis is suggesting here (with the connections 12, 13 and 22, 23)
are the constraints in the evolutionary dynamics of the d-domain of tRNA molecule. A local change in
the sequence (and therefore in the structural conﬁguration) must be physically and thermodynamically
compatible with the biological structure and cannot take place unless the molecular “neighbors” are
ready to accommodate the change event. Thus, the BN points us in the direction of these “neighbors”,
revealing the pattern of nucleotides changes in the linked positions. The non-canonical structure
(with a larger loop and a shorter arm in the D-domain) is the results of one of the possible evolutionary
paths of the tRNA molecule: these paths are reﬂected in the concerted changes in positions 12, 13,
22 and 23. One such evolutionary scenario, compatible with the observed BN, is as follows: initial
mutations occur at positions 13, 22 (AU to GC). This event does not alter the secondary structure
(it could be considered a neutral event), but represents a “pre-adaptation” to the next events that lead
to the breakage of the stem at positions 12, 23 bringing about the altered secondary structure with a
larger loop and a shorter stem.
While Figure 2 shows the BN built from all the available tRNA sequence data combined, obviously
similar BNs can be constructed from the different subgroups (or (sub)classes; we will use these terms
interchangeably throughout the manuscript) of tRNAs. Such subclasses can be stratiﬁed by the species
groups, domains of life, amino acids, etc. (Series of aa-stratiﬁed BNs are available directly from the authors,
in pdf or dot formats.) Then, one can compare resulting BNs by observing topological differences
(presence or absence of particular edges between the nodes). Qualitative and quantitative analysis of
these topological differences can prove very useful in elucidating various tRNA determinants. Such
detailed analysis is outside of the scope of the present study (however, see the following two sections
for the baseline analyses of amino acid- and domain of life-based stratiﬁcations), but it is our intention
to carry out comprehensive tRNA subgroup analyses in the future, predominantly to clarify certain
aspects of tRNA gene histories. One caveat here, though, is the necessarily smaller samples, leading to
the less robust BNs. For such smaller samples, "downgrading" from high-level-abstraction of graphical
multivariate analysis (BNs, in their essence) to series of statistically rigorous pairwise tests might be
advantageous. In the following section, we describe precisely such an approach.
3.2. Amino Acids Speciﬁcity

As depicted in Figure 2, the full-set tRNA BN is reﬂective of the overall organization of tRNA
molecules, comprising all position associations that can be extracted from the data (inclusive of all
types of tRNAs). Therefore, some of the observed relationships are common to all (or most of) the
tRNAs present in the database, whereas others apply only to selected subsets. For example, in a group
of tRNAs speciﬁc for a given amino acid, a singular base (or a speciﬁc combination of bases) could be
primarily responsible for amino acid determination by aaRSes.
Here, we set out to investigate the positional relationships speciﬁc to particular classes of amino
acids. Simply put, this analysis utilizes the notion that if the position i is, in some sense, “important” for
a speciﬁc class of tRNAs, the conditional distribution of nucleotides at ith position within the class will
be different from the unconditional distribution of nucleotides at the same position over the complete
set of tRNAs. It is possible to estimate corresponding distribution dissimilarity (AKA distribution

177

MDPI Books

Life 2018, 8, 5

divergence, distance); furthermore, we assume that the higher the dissimilarity, the more likely is the
associated position to play a signiﬁcant biological role for the speciﬁc subgroup of tRNAs considered.
Otherwise, we assume the position to be relatively “unimportant” for this tRNA subgroup—although
it might still have an overall functional signiﬁcance, for all tRNA molecules in general.
Formally, given the probability space (ω, , μ) and a set of categorical random variables with
range deﬁned by the set of nucleotides and a gap symbol, s = ( a, c, g, u, _)
xi : ω → s,
we denote the distribution at ith position of the alignment by
q i = μ ( x i ).

(1)

Note that the gap state here is used for convenience in interpreting the results in Figures 3 and 4
(and Supplemental Figures) only. It was not used in the BN construction/interpretation. Instead,
during the BN reconstruction, dependencies between positions 17a, 20ab, e1-27 were treated
as (comparatively) rare events, under multinomial local probability models in correspondingly
reduced datasets.

a j as

pij = μ( xi ∩ [y = a j ]).

178

Our goal is then to estimate the dissimilarity between pij and qi using some appropriate
dissimilarity or distance measure. For this purpose, we select the (symmetrised and smoothed)
measure of relative entropy l; its square root is a proper metric (distance function), which is a desirable
property. We deﬁne

l ( pij , qi ) = d( pij , mij ) + d(qi , mij ),

(5)

(Below, we will occasionally refer to l ( pij , qi ) as simply lij , where appropriate.) The quantity
denoted by lij is the symmetrised measure of relative entropy (RE), also known as Jensen–Shannon
divergence, or JSD ([21,22]; conveniently, its square root deﬁnes a mathematically correct distance
function. Because the image of l is always a ﬁnite interval im(l ) = [0, max(l )], the results
(inter-distributional differences) are easy to interpret—when l is close to 0, the distributions that
are being compared are very similar, whereas, when l is close to its maximum value, the distributions
have little to nothing in common. Conveniently, this allows us to superimpose an absolute scale on the
degree of “importance” that a particular position has within the context of a given class of tRNAs—not
only can we contrast the relative importances between different positions, but we can also estimate
how important any given position is in absolute terms.
A series of plots (Figure 3 for Gly, the simplest, most basic, amino acid, example; Supplemental
Figures S1–S22 for all amino acids) shows the “importance” proﬁle for each class of tRNA in y,
partitioned into the three life domains, Archaea (Arc), Bacteria (Bac), and Eukarya (Euk). A brief
glance at the charts reveals that each tRNA class possesses a unique “ﬁngerprint” pattern of RE
values assigned to the tRNA positions. Throughout all the classes, however, certain general features
are easily identiﬁable: for instance, codon position (34, 35, 36) shows high “importance” in all tRNA
groups; on the other hand, invariant and semi-invariant positions are associated with low “importance”
(see Figure 4 for a heat plot summary visualization of tRNA position importance, by life domain
(Figure 4a–c), tRNA class, and nucleotide position). The next obvious question is: just how high is
sufﬁciently (signiﬁcantly) high? Obviously, positions 35, 36 are signiﬁcant, and, for example, position
33 is not. What about position 34? Throughout most of this study (see also Table 1 below), we have
set a somewhat arbitrary signiﬁcance cutoff value of RE, at 0.2 (marked by the red horizontal lines in
Figure 3 and Supplemental Figures S1–S22), largely following current literature and visual analysis of
the distributions. In order to impose a rigorous quantitative cutoff measure, however, we can generate
a set of random samples y∗j from y to obtain
pij∗ = μ( xi ∩ y∗j ).

This operation is expected to have the effect of scrambling any probabilistic relationship between
y and xi (unless there is a systematic bias in the data). We then deﬁne
lij∗ = l ( pij∗ , qi )

and obtain a sequence {lij∗ }m
j=1 induced by the random sampling of y, which should correspond to

the distribution h0 of random noise in the data. In our experiments, setting m at 105 was sufﬁcient
for convergence. Whenever the observed value of lij exceeds this “random noise” threshold, it is
reasonable to suspect that there is a non-trivial signal. It appears that, for all amino acid classes,
in almost all positions, this is indeed the case. Therefore, it is highly improbable that most observed
179

lij values could have resulted from the random processes. To put it bluntly, almost nothing about most
tRNA positions is even close to random.

shown for three life domains: Archaea (a); Bacteria (b) and Eukarya (c). Higher values correspond to
“hotter” colors. tRNA position numbering is as in Figure 3. This is a summary visualization of the
detailed plots presented in Supplemental Figures S1–S22.

Of course, this is not at all unexpected from the purely biological viewpoint—this observation is
simply a conﬁrmation of the fact that the tRNAs for a certain amino acid class are not independent
and that they share speciﬁc structural and sequence information.

What was not expected, however, is that, at almost every position, the distribution between the
tRNA classes is highly non-random. Two factors likely attribute to this effect: ﬁrst, the vestiges of the
phylogenetic relationship between the tRNAs; and, second, structural and functional aspects associated
with each tRNA class. After having observed the non-random signal associated with a particular tRNA
position (as detailed in Supplemental Figures S1–S22 and summarized in Figure 4), we now need to
establish whether it is not only “high”, but also “speciﬁc” (to the tRNA class). The non-speciﬁc signal
can be attributed to some other kind of underlying relationship (e.g., a structural one); in general, such
signal is a second- (or higher-) order relationship compared to the tRNA class-driven one. It can also
be interpreted as a “background” signal, present irrespective of the tRNA class stratiﬁcation. It is
intrinsic to the tRNA structure in general but has little to no relevance regarding amino acid speciﬁcity.
These higher-order signals are unlikely to be directly responsible for any speciﬁc tRNA function but
will be strong enough to show as non-random effects. In this context, we posit that the positions with
“high” and “speciﬁc” signals are the ones with the highest likelihood of being “important” (for the
biological function of a particular tRNA class). They are preserved within, and discriminate between,
speciﬁc tRNA groups. In contrast, in “non-speciﬁc” positions, non-random signal simply either reﬂects
the echoes of the phylogenetic relationships, not yet completely dissolved, or points to the general
tRNA structural relationship patterns.
In summary, by selecting the positions with “high” and “speciﬁc” RE signal, we zero in on the
positions crucial for the biological functions and features of speciﬁc tRNA groups (as opposed to
the “background”, or higher-order, signal in non-speciﬁc positions associated with the phylogenetic,
structural, etc., aspects of all the tRNAs).
One way to separate the latter (not directly related to the amino acid speciﬁcity) positions would
be to compute RE after conditioning the data for the states in position i, and repeating for all n positions,
thus obtaining a new collection of distributions:

ziqr = μ xq ∩ { xi = r } ,

(6)

where r is one of the possible states (nucleotides/gap) at the position i with position q = i. By using
this procedure, one can establish the baseline RE distribution associated with each position.
3.3. Identiﬁcation, in the Three Domains of Life, of the tRNA Amino Acid Speciﬁcity Identity Determinants

Typically, in the literature, the notion “tRNA identity determinants” refers to the nucleotide
positions that are recognized by aaRSes, and are involved in the loading of tRNAs. Here, we expand
on that deﬁnition. By “identity determinants” we mean that all of the nucleotide positions that are
potentially predictive with respect to identifying a particular tRNA subclass. Table 1 summarizes the
quantitative results of our analyses (by a given amino acid, and the three domains of life).

Table 1. Determinant tRNA positions classiﬁed by the amino acid and the three domains of life
(Archaea, Arc; Bacteria, Bac; Eukarya, Euk). Only positions with the Relative Entropy (RE) value higher
than the preset cutoff value (set at RE approx. 0.2, as illustrated in Figure 3 and Supplemental Figures
S1–S22) are shown. Note that the preset cutoff value is higher than that suggested by the “random
noise” {lij∗ }m
j=1 sequence (see text). For compatibility with the literature, the position numbering system
follows that of [23,24]. It corresponds to the ﬁrst row in Figure 1. Paired bases in the secondary structure
of tRNA are shown as connected by a dash; for example, the 3-70 pair indicates that in the secondary
structure of the tRNA molecule, the bases at position 3 and 70 should be paired [23,24]. Similarly,
“=” indicates tertiary interactions among tRNA nucleotides. Question marks indicates the uncertain
positions, that is to say positions that might not be important for the tRNA molecule. “Conﬁrmed”
indicates that the nucleotides identiﬁed as “important”, or identity determinants, in the experimental
analyses [2,25] were also signiﬁcant (high RE values) in our analysis. “Low signiﬁcance” means that
the “experimentally proven to be important/identity determinants” nucleotides were not associated
with high RE values. On the contrary, “Suggested” positions exhibit high RE values but so far have not
been registered in the experimental analysis literature.

Here, we will discuss Gly tRNA as an example (see also Figure 3 a–c for the exact RE values).
The rationale between this choice is two-fold: ﬁrst, Gly is obviously the simplest possible, most basic,
amino acid. Second, it is well-represented in the tRNA database, thus making this example particularly
robust. Consider bacterial Gly tRNAs (Figure 3b). Immediately, positions 2-71 and 3-70 are conﬁrmed
as important ones for the tRNA identity. However, positions 10-25 and 1-72, previously recognized
by means of experimental analyses [2,25], do not appear to be identity determinants in our analysis.
Interestingly, 1-72, 2-71 and 3-70 are all present in the same ancestor stem; while the experimental
analysis supports all three, our information theory-based analysis implies that the 1-72 pair is not
really involved in determining the identity of Gly tRNAs in the Bacteria domain. Is the experimental
analysis pinpointing 1-72 simply incorrect, and thus should be further validated? A similar scenario
unfolds in the case of positions 10-25, supported by the experimental analysis; instead, our analysis
suggests 29-41 and 31-39. These latter pairs apparently constitute the kind of identity that might
not involve the aaRSes at all. Moving on to Eukarya (Figure 3c), 2-71 and 3-70 are conﬁrmed by our
analysis as well; 1-72 and 10-25 are not supported by either experimental or information-theoretic
analyses. Neither are they supported by our analysis in Archaea Gly tRNAs (Figure 3a). This seems to
strengthen the suggestion that 1-72 and 10-25 pairs are not in fact involved in determining the identity
of Gly tRNAs in all domains, in spite of the experimental (aaRSes) evidence. On the contrary, positions
31-39 (in addition to 2-71 and 3-70) are supported by our analysis for all three domains. This hints at a
strong signal because it is persistently present in smaller, relatively independent (or at least sufﬁciently
heterogeneous) tRNA subsets.
Another representative example is the Ala tRNAs, where our analysis conﬁrmed all known critical
position (e.g., position 3-70 for Bacteria and Eukarya). For Ala tRNA, our analysis further suggests
potentially important positions, namely 31-39 in the anticodon stem and 32,38 in the anticodon
loop for Eukarya, and 20a for Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya. Such analyses can of course be
extended to all amino acid identity determinants, dovetailing with the existing and ever-growing
literature. This largely statistical approach should ideally precede (or augment) the experimental
work, in suggesting the possible (and likely) identity determinants to be pursued and validated
experimentally. For instance, just by looking at Figure 3, positions 31-39 would be a strong candidate in
the case of Gly tRNAs. Detailing chemistry and biochemistry of particular tRNAs and their positions
is outside the scope of this manuscript—rather, it is a general future research direction for both
ourselves and investigators elsewhere, armed with the methodology presented in this communication.
(Speciﬁcally, we intend to follow up with a comprehensive, more detailed, analysis of the tRNA
families for which both phylogenetic/alignment data and atomic structures of their complexes with
aaRSes are available.)

4. Discussion and Future Directions

Life 2018, 8, 5

While probabilistic directed acyclic graph (PDAG) representation (as realized in the BN) is a
conveniently compressed, informative and intuitively appealing visualization of the probabilistic
relationships observable in the data, when it comes to ﬁne detail scrutiny, high order abstraction can
be a shortcoming. The information contained in conditional node distribution is difﬁcult to summarize
and interpret in its totality because of the multitude of all possible states. For instance, for a node
with the three edges, one would have to scrutinize a 27x3 conditional probability table only to get
a partial picture. In addition, it would be a partial picture because formation of the comprehensive
conditional probability table would require inference over the complete Markov blanket of the node
(which, in most cases, would include more than the immediate neighbor nodes) (see [18,19] for a
comprehensive discussion of conditional independence and “Markov blankets” in directed graphs).
Recall that one of the motivations of our research was to study amino acid group-speciﬁc
changes in tRNAs, or, to paraphrase, to develop a procedure for (1) conditioning on the aa variable;
and (2) somehow comparing, in a quantiﬁable way, the resulting group-speciﬁc dependence structures.
Building BNs for each and every aa class is one such procedure; however, quantifying topological
differences between resulting networks is a difﬁcult problem. Indeed, it is not enough to just “count”
the presence or absence of a speciﬁc edge in the network—one would have to establish which particular
set of differences pushes the model outside of the BN equivalence class [18,19]. While doable, this
necessitates further BN methodological development, which is outside the scope of this paper (but is a
research direction we are pursuing presently). Of course, there is also an issue of decreased sample
sizes (when stratifying by aa variable). (We remind here that all of the BN built for the different tRNA
subclasses (stratiﬁed by aa and three life domains) are available directly from the authors.)
An alternative way to deal with the complexity of the situation (i.e., “top-down” analysis from
the high order abstraction of the BN topology to the individual tRNA determinants), described
in detail in the previous section, required making two crucial simpliﬁcations. First, we restrict
further (“downstream”) analysis to pairwise relationships (conditioned on the aa class variable) only.
This step compresses much of the dynamics into one low order approximation for every group that
can be easily assessed and compared by means of simple charts (as in Figure 3 and Supplemental
Figures S1–S22) and 2D color arrays (as in Figure 4). Second, we switch from the more comprehensive
model scoring function (the MDL principle that underlies our BN structure learning algorithm) to
a Mutual Information (MI)-based criterion that retains the desired feature of information theoretic
entropy in order to condense the values of a given multidimensional probability distribution to a
single distance-like value (namely, RE).
In summary, our procedural approach is a three-pronged one:
(1)

(2)
(3)

Build the BNs for the tRNA sub- and super-classes of interest. Visually compare and contrast
topologies. Interpret the intra-tRNA features (dependencies between the positions, pairwise and
more complex) and inter-tRNA class differences.
In parallel, use measures of distribution divergence to identify aa class-speciﬁc tRNA
identity positions.
For such positions, go back to the results of (1) to identify and interpret dependencies between
these positions and other tRNA sites.

Ideally, this process can be further automated by developing routines for directly querying and
performing statistical inference within Markov blankets (conditional probability tables) of nodes
of interest, and for direct comparison of BN topologies by differentiating the equivalence classes
associated with them. This is an ongoing research direction.
Our approach, as implemented in this study, is conceptually similar to the recent data-driven
analyses of tRNA databases [26,27]. Galili and colleagues used a decision-tree based classiﬁer
to perform a variable selection (embedded in classiﬁcation) to derive the minimal set of tRNA
identity/informative positions for each amino acid in Arc domain. This is also a machine
185

MDPI Books

Life 2018, 8, 5

learning-based approach; decision tree-based classiﬁers are in many ways a complementary technique
to the BN modeling. However, single decision trees (such as Classiﬁcation and Regression Trees
(CART) used in the analysis) are notorious for getting stuck into the local extremums, especially at
the earlier stages of decision process (corresponding to the more important tRNA positions, in our
case). Therefore, generated tRNA identity/informative position sets are, while undeniably compact,
potentially biased, and might not be particularly robust. This is especially true for smaller datasets
with more “difﬁcult” dimensionality (such as aa-speciﬁc tRNA subclasses). Ideally, such sets should be
at least complemented by the variable sets generated via methods espousing more exhaustive search
(BNs, or ensemble decision tree-based classiﬁers). Depending on the extent of decision tree pruning,
single decision tree-based classiﬁers can also be relatively blind to the rare variants (which is not a
drawback that BNs share). In our opinion, it would be a very fruitful research direction to adapt
the analyses in [26] to more robust ensemble classiﬁers, such as Random Forests with double-loop
cross-validation [28]. At this time, however, we believe that the robustness and exhaustiveness of the
variable sets generated by our approach is preferable to the compactness of the sets generated by a
single decision tree—especially in the context of the exploratory, hypothesis-generating analysis activity.
In statistical terms, the latter is simply too false negative-prone. Galili et al. [26] clearly recognize
the shortcomings of such “greedy” algorithms as CART; however, they conclude that combinatorial
efﬁciency and compactness of the results outweigh such drawbacks. We will re-emphasize here that
CART and BNs, in this context (of predominantly exploratory analytic activity), complement (rather
than compete with) each other.
Zamudio and José ([27]) used mutual entropy to discover isoacceptor tRNA positions that
form “clusters” with respective anticodons. (This is mathematically similar to SNP linkage
disequilibrium—except, of course, that the underlying biology, whatever it might be, is likely different
in most cases.) In statistical terms, this presents a univariate testing alternative to our analysis (which
is multivariate by design), with all the intrinsic advantages and disadvantages thereof. The primary
advantage is that it allows to “manually” zero in on the primary intra-tRNA relationships of interests
(such as identifying tRNA isoacceptor sites that are highly related to anticodon). Consequently,
the primary disadvantage is the inability to capture more complex (than pairwise), non-additive,
relationships. Similarly, although pairwise testing is obviously very computationally efﬁcient, as a
strategy it is essentially a series of independent tests that has to be carried out “manually”, which
is not conducive to the automated hypothesis generation (a hallmark of machine learning methods
such as BNs and, to a somewhat lesser degree, decision tree-based classiﬁers). In our view, BN
analysis is the method of choice for automatically identifying (and visualizing) potentially interesting
intra-tRNA relationships. These can be further scrutinized using univariate testing such as developed
by Zamudio and José [27], or conditional probability tables associated with the speciﬁc nodes/edges
in the BN context.
Our approach can also be highly useful in addressing the speciﬁc problem of predicting tertiary
(3D) tRNA interactions. Brieﬂy, the problem can be deﬁned as follows: thorough analysis of tRNA
sequences (such as carried out in this study, and by us and others before) can be used to derive
the basic secondary (2D) structure of tRNA. Standard 2D structure prediction algorithms aim to
ﬁnd thermodynamically stable 2D tRNA structures that minimize free energy given the primary
tRNA sequence. This is a straightforward search/optimization task, and it is largely tractable within
the tRNA sequences domain, assuming standard complementary base pairings hold (see [29] for a
recent example). The resulting 2D structure is represented by a familiar tRNA “cloverleaf” consisting
of the helix (stem) and the loop regions—the former subject to canonical Watson–Crick and GU
pairing rules—the latter, less constrained. We now move on to the prediction of 3D tRNA structures
(also known as “l-shape”), and this is a much more daunting task. Part of the intrinsic difﬁculty
is that 3D structure prediction usually relies on the 2D structure (as a starting point), to which
thermodynamics- and kinetics-driven operators (reﬂecting relatively minor free energy changes) are
subsequently applied. This, of course, suffers greatly from the cumulative “dead reckoning” effect.

186

MDPI Books

Life 2018, 8, 5

Another complication is that 3D tRNA structures do not exist in a vacuum, but are shaped in the
process of interacting with other molecules within different cellular environments (mitochondria,
ribosomes, etc.). In addition, yet another (related) complication has to do with the formal deﬁnition of
operators (reﬂecting energy changes in 2D/3D structure search/optimization process). They are based
on tabulated thermodynamic parameters estimated under “standard” ﬁxed conditions (temperature,
pH, ionic strength), which might or might not hold under different circumstances (varying cellular
environments, interacting proteins and other RNAs, etc.).
The work of Mustoe et al. [30] is a representative recent example of in silico 3D tRNA analysis
that had to be complemented by experimental work in order to reach unequivocal conclusions. Here,
just as with the more speciﬁc tRNA – aaRS coupling problem, experimental methods become essential.
Expensive and time-consuming procedures (crystallographic and spectroscopic techniques) can obtain,
or conﬁrm, structural information, but even then there is no guarantee that the results generalize to
in vivo. In particular, there is usually a number of alternative, however similar, optimal structures,
and the one that reaches the absolute minimum (in free energy) in silico or in vitro is not necessarily
the one actually functioning in vivo.
Thus, we return to the notion of the automated data-driven discovery of “interesting”
polymorphisms/structural features/interactions within the tRNA molecules that would otherwise
be difﬁcult to capture because of an altogether unknown biological context, or prohibitively high
predictive algorithm complexity, or modeling assumption violations, or simply sheer time and expense
of experimental work.
However, another beneﬁt of the tRNA BN analysis lies in its potential utility for tRNA
phylogenetic reconstruction. Applying standard nucleotide distance metrics, or nucleotide transition
probabilities (usually a cornerstone of phylogenetic reconstruction) to the tRNA molecules is
questionable for a number of reasons ([31] for recent discussion). However, information contained
in structural (topological) differences between BNs estimated for speciﬁc subclasses of tRNAs can be
used to measure phylogenetic distances between these subclasses, which can be further translated
into the phylogenetic hierarchy. In fact, unlike with some ad hoc metrics, differences in BNs by their
very nature capture the “holistic” (more complete, comprehensive) picture of the differences between
a given pair of subclasses—indeed, the sole purpose of BNs is to reﬂect the signiﬁcant probabilistic
relationships contained in the “ﬂat” data, regardless of the underlying nature of these relationships.
Assuming that these observed probabilistic relationships reﬂect true biological interactions (and not
random noise)—a reasonable assumption for the sufﬁciently large datasets, such as the currently
available tRNA data—they should be a viable foundation for the analysis of tRNA gene histories.
Such BN-based approach to tRNA phylogeny is conceptually similar to, and would complement,
the approach espoused in [31], which prioritizes “anchor elements” based on syntenic tRNA
properties as the most useful for deriving phylogenetic information. The rationale behind the
latter strategy is that relatively stable synteny anchors are less susceptible to the randomizing and
obfuscating effects of the rapid-churn concerted evolution of gene families (such as tRNAs). Similarly,
topological differences between BNs built from the different tRNA subclasses are less sensitive to the
evolutionary (background) noise, and reﬂect robust features that have been/are being ﬁxated during
the correspondent tRNA subclasses’ formation. One of the intriguing future directions of our work is
to trace tRNA gene histories using BN topological distances and see how the results compare to the
synteny-based phylogenies of tRNAs in, for example, fruit ﬂies and primates [31].
5. Conclusions

If there is one thing that can be said with certainty about the tRNA world, both extant and extinct,
is that it is/was arguably much more complex (quantitatively and qualitatively) than what we used
to think as recently as two to three decades ago ([32] and references therein). Amusingly, it has been
suggested [32] that the ongoing evolution of the multitude of tRNA species can best be described
by analogy with an artiﬁcial intelligence system (speciﬁcally, an interplay of minimax algorithms).

187

MDPI Books

Life 2018, 8, 5

This might be a stretch; if anything, tRNA populations can be better approximated by the “genetic
algorithms” (which, in turn, were developed to mimic natural genetic/evolution processes in a ﬁrst
place). However, whimsicality aside, we do believe that artiﬁcial intelligence methodology (speciﬁcally,
machine learning techniques) is the best way to approach secondary data analysis of growing tRNA
sequence databases, be it for the purposes of tRNA structural research, identity elements cataloging,
unraveling tRNA-disease associations, or tRNA evolutionary studies.
This brings us to the problem of genetic code and translation machinery origins, a subject
unequivocally linked with the tRNAs and their (early) evolution. A recent review by Koonin and
Novozhilov ([33]) suggests, among other things, that “theoretical study of the genetic code as a
cryptographic problem has largely run its course”. In our opinion, this sentiment, while having a
defeatist ﬂair about it, is fundamentally correct. The consensus understanding, at this time, revolves
around the “synthesis” of stereochemical afﬁnity hypothesis, and frozen accidents alongside universal
genetic code code expansion. The former largely hinges on the "important" tRNA sites other than
the anticodon, automated discovery of which is of course the primary goal of this study. This should
be followed by the experimental work as well as dynamical modeling, along the lines suggested by
Koonin and Novozhilov [33], Carter and Wills [34], Martinez-Rodriguez et al. ([6]), to name just a few.
Such experimental work is time-consuming and costly; not coincidentally, one of the primary
deliverables of this study is the list of "suggested" tRNA positions of interest (third column in Table 1).
Moreover, it is possible to "rank" the suggested positions using the RE metric. For any speciﬁc
subgroup of tRNAs, investigators can identify the suggested (and so far experimentally unveriﬁed)
tRNA positions and simultaneously rank/select them using RE and/or various RE cutoff criteria.
The resulting selected positions can then be scrutinized by identifying other tRNA positions associated
with them in the appropriate tRNA subgroup BNs. After subsequently evaluating (and further
prioritizing) these selected positions from the evolutionary, biochemical, biological and structural (2D,
3D) viewpoints, one can proceed to the thus more precisely guided experimental work.
On a philosophical note, even unequivocal experimental validation of the processes suspected to
have taken place during the genetic code/translation apparatus origin does not yet prove that these
events actually took place. There are many possible, and perfectly realistic, alternative pathways
leading to the extant universal genetic code; the sheer volume of related literature (and hypotheses
and scenarios suggested therein) attests to the fact. Experimentally reproducing one of them does not
preclude the possibility of another, and does not necessarily bring us that much closer to the deﬁnitive
proof of “what has really happened”. Similarly, for in silico work, the Occam’s razor approach
(which underlies much of the machine learning research by directing us to seek the most compact
system/model ﬁtting the observed data the best) is subject to a parallel logical fallacy, that of assuming
that nature (and evolution) deals with globally optimized, at any given moment, biological systems
(“greedy search” of locally optimized states being signiﬁcantly closer to the reality of evolutionary
processes). At any rate, while the purely “cryptographic” approach to the elucidation of universal
genetic code origins might feel unsatisfying [33], we strongly believe that non-trivial relationships and
associations observed in the extant molecules (principally tRNAs and aaRSes) can and should point to
the more likely (statistically and experimentally) scenarios of code origin, or at least to certain likely
evolutionary steps along the way. Much of the recent work in the ﬁeld has been pursued following
this paradigm [27,35–37].
Detailing plausible scenarios of genetic code origin is outside the scope of this study; rather,
our goal here was to present a useful instrument and methodological framework for identifying
statistically signiﬁcant relationships between the positions within the tRNA molecule and between
different subclasses of tRNAs. It is our intention for this novel methodology to assist the investigators
in pinpointing non-random patterns of change in tRNAs, at both micro- and macro-evolutionary levels.
