Preface
Multimedia as we know it has gained tremendous importance over the last decade. It
spans quite a few areas of computer science involving programming, algorithms,
communication technology, various media of communications and so on. It has raised
the quality of communication by adding more than one media of communication such
as audio, video, text, graphics and animation. Its importance in terms of medical
science, engineering, entertainment, education, distance learning, and to all aspects of
life, cannot be overstated. This book provides an up-to-date accounts of various
research and developments taking place in this field of study,
In first chapter, we talk about communication network issues. Since a major concern of
multimedia is quick and efficient flow of multimedia materials like audio and video,
this chapter sets the scene. Network-on-Chip (NoC), which is considered as a global
communication vehicle, is discussed. NetCal is a mathematical framework to derive
worst-case bounds on maximum latency and backlog. With these two models, the
delay and backlog buffer bounds can be calculated.
The next chapter discusses the problems of imparting distance learning through
multimedia in developing countries. We suggest mobile technology as a viable and
affordable media through which distance learning could be efficiently imparted to
billions of people. We also present some examples of achievements in this field, such
as the mobile use of telephone, photography, audio, video, internet, eBook, animations
and so on, that could deliver effective distance education in developing countries.
The chapters go on to discuss the ubiquitous computing platform that should be
designed for quality control of multimedia and data context through the Internet, as
the standard of signals can be weaker based on geographical locations.
Next, image inpainting for Thangka images of Tibet is considered. Thangka images
bear valuable cultural heritage of the region. A new method is proposed for damaged
image inpainting of Thangka images; combining the shape of damaged patches and
type of neighborhood patches according to the current algorithm characteristics of
image inpainting, automaticaly implementing damaged regions. The chapter deals
with the need of semantic-based Thangka image retrieval to establish an artifact
annotation Thangka image database in a more object-oriented world. Thangka image

Preface

annotation will be a heavy task with different classification, different content, and a
picture with a lot of objects.
The next chapter discusses a web-based co-operative learning project between the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the USA and the Universidad
Politécnica de Valencia (UPV) in Spain, which has been underway since 2000. Its aim is
to put technological students in Valencia (Spain) and technological students in Boston
(USA) in contact by means of a jointly developed interactive website. This website is
an open platform that allows the registered students to interact with each other;
building a technological social networking not only by using text-based messages
(including a built-in chat facility), but also by uploading and downloading multimedia
files, i.e. videos and graphics created by the students themselves. The content of the
website is updated in real time and is fully developed and controlled by the
participating students themselves, so as to reflect their interests, views and other
cultural and social components.
The next chapter describes a mobile application for Android that has shown how a
GPS-based social network can help people communicate between each other and
display a map with information about important topics like road condition (traffic,
checkpoints, car accidents, road work), Facebook events, Facebook Friends’ position
and any other event that can happen on a road. The main failure of current navigation
applications is that traffic information is provided by sensors on the road, but users
must pay to access them or must check them on a free website. The proposed
application allows the user to have all the information he needs right on his mobile
device and, according to Mobile Web 2.0 philosophy, the information is provided by
the other social network users; a user can report an event that will be shown on other
users’ maps. This application can help reduce traffic jams and pollution. The
application can ask the user for a traffic condition, if the user’s speed is particularly
slow and can notify the user of new events around him. According to privacy
agreement the user can customize every aspect of the application, including
notifications, requests, events visualization on his map and his own visualization on
other users’ map.
I express my sincere gratitude to InTech, Open Access publisher, for their help and
guidance in this publication process, particularly to Ms Daria Nahtigal, Publishing
Process Manager who was very helpful in getting things together for the book.

1. Introduction
Since around year 2000, Network-on-Chip (NoC) has been proposed as a global
communication paradigm to interconnect tens or hundreds of cores on a single chip
(Bjerregaard & Mahadevan, 2006). One key challenge for NoCs has been Quality of Service
(QoS), which is concerned about performance guarantees or bounds. To achieve QoS,
formal performance analysis is essential because it overcomes the uncertainty in results and
lengthiness in time of simulation-based approaches (Lu, 2007).
Network calculus (NetCal) (Chang, 2000; Cruz, 1991; Le Boudec & Thiran, 2004) is a
mathematical framework to derive worst-case bounds on maximum latency and backlog. The
beauty of NetCal relies on two abstraction models, an arrival curve for trafﬁc, and a service
curve for network elements (router, relay node, interface, channel, server etc.). Arrival curves
bound the accumulated amount of trafﬁc. Service curves describe minimal service levels
of network elements. With these two models, the delay and backlog buffer bounds can be
calculated. NetCal has been extremely successful when applied to ATM and IP networks
with both differentiated and integrated services to achieve predictable performance without
over-dimensioning network architectures (Le Boudec & Thiran, 2004). Recently NetCal has
also been applied to wireless LAN (Agharebparast & Leung, 2005), sensor networks (Schmitt
& Roedig, 2005), and on-chip networks (Qian et al., 2010) etc.
Our intention is to use NetCal for communication performance analysis of self-similar
trafﬁc in on-chip networks. ATM, Ethernet and Internet trafﬁc has shown self-similar
characteristics (Park & Willinger, 2000). In on-chip networks, it turns out also to be true
for many applications, particularly, multimedia trafﬁc, as supported by (Scherrer et al., 2005;
Soteriou et al., 2006; Varatkar & Marculescu, 2004). By analyzing on-chip trafﬁc traces, they
demonstrate that packets injected from routing nodes possess scale-invariant burstiness over
time. However, existing self-similar trafﬁc models (Mao & Panwar, 2006; Park & Willinger,
2000) are not directly subject to NetCal analysis. The reason is simply because they do not
comply with the arrival curve model. Therefore the purposes of our work are triple-folded:
(1) to ﬁnd an arrival curve for self-similar trafﬁc, if it exists; (2) otherwise, propose an arrival
curve to envelop the self-similar trafﬁc; (3) to perform analysis based on the proposed arrival
model using the NetCal framework. Performing these tasks should keep the beauty of
NetCal and still enable us to apply known NetCal analysis methods and results to analyze
the performance and buffering cost of networks transporting self-similar trafﬁc ﬂows.

The remainder of the chapter is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes related work and
our contributions. In Section 3, we ﬁrst introduce the property of self-similar trafﬁc. Then
we present the Fractional Brownian Motion (FBM) model (Norros, 1995), which is used to
characterize the self-similarity of trafﬁc, and how to estimate FBM parameters. In Section 4,
we present our main ﬁndings in the form of theorems, proposing an extended arrival curve to
constrain self-similar trafﬁc. Afterwards, in Section 5, we present formulas to calculate delay
and backlog bounds. Assuming the latency-rate server model (Stiliadis & Varma, 1998) for
network elements, we give closed-form equations. Moreover, to give a complete picture of
our method, we describe a performance analysis ﬂow to show how to conduct performance
analysis for self-similar trafﬁc. Experiments and results are reported in Section 6. Finally we
draw conclusions in Section 7.

2. Related work
Since being initially identiﬁed in Ethernet by Leland et al. (Leland et al., 1994), trafﬁc
self-similarity has far-reaching inﬂuence on trafﬁc modeling and performance analysis.
Explorations of the nature of self-similarity and applications of this complex phenomenon
have been extensively studied and summarized (Park & Willinger, 2000). In the context of
NoCs, researchers have found the evidence of self-similarity from on-chip communication
traces. In (Varatkar & Marculescu, 2004), Varatkar et al. ﬁrst introduced self-similarity as a
fundamental property exhibited by the bursty trafﬁc between on-chip modules in multimedia
video applications. This work captured the trafﬁc characteristics between pair-wise nodes
rather than for the entire network. Later, Soteriou et al. (Soteriou et al., 2006) empirically
studied a large set of trafﬁc traces gathered from the execution of SPEC, MediaBench and
bit-parallel benchmarks over the entire on-chip network with different architectures and
showed the presence of self-similar phenomena in on-chip trafﬁc ﬂows.
Cruz (Cruz, 1991) has pioneered the network calculus, which is based on bounds of trafﬁc
ﬂows. A useful family of bound functions for concise descriptions has the form α(t) = rt +
b, where r is the rate and b limits the burstiness of the ﬂow. Based on Cruz’s foundation,
Chang (Chang, 2000) and Le Boudec (Le Boudec & Thiran, 2004) have further developed the
network calculus theory and based it on min-plus algebra. The basic elements in this algebra
are arrival curves as an abstraction of application trafﬁc and service curves as an abstraction
for components (network elements). A well-deﬁned service curve is the so-called latency-rate
function β R,T , where R is the service rate and T the maximum response delay of the node
(Stiliadis & Varma, 1998).
Stochastic network calculus (Ciucu et al., 2005; Jiang, 2006; Starobinski & Sidi, 2000; Yin et al.,
2002) is the probabilistic version of the (deterministic) network calculus. It has recently been
developed for stochastic service guarantee analysis. Stochastic network calculus combines
the deterministic network calculus with statistical multiplexing. For this, several stochastic
versions of arrival curve have been proposed by extending the concept of arrival curve
to the stochastic case based on the trafﬁc amount property or virtual backlog property.
Among the existing stochastic arrival curves, Sum of Exponentials, Weibull Bounded
Burstiness (WBB), Fractional Brownian Motion (FBM) and Multifractal Brownian Motion
(MBM) envelope processes consider the self-similar trafﬁc (Mao & Panwar, 2006). In contrast
to the deterministic arrival curves, stochastic arrival curves envelop trafﬁc tighter but have
higher implementation complexity.

In (Norros, 1995), Norros introduced the FBM model to capture the long-range dependence
within the self-similar trafﬁc. This model inspires WBB envelope process and is the basis for
the FBM and MBM envelope processes (Mao & Panwar, 2006). Since the stochastic properties
of the FBM process retain well when the trafﬁc is multiplexed, randomly split, or goes through
a buffering system, the FBM model serves well for the objective of concatenating single-hop
analysis into an end-to-end analysis (Cheng et al., 2007).
We link self-similar trafﬁc to deterministic network calculus. We develop an extended linear
arrival model as its arrival curve, and then apply NetCal analysis on it. Our arrival curve is
also constructed based on the FBM process. In contrast to other stochastic arrival curves, it is
coupled with deterministic network calculus. Also, it is an extension of the traditional linear
expression, thus easy to use and understand and simple in implementation. We summarize
our contributions as follows:
• We prove that self-similar trafﬁc cannot be enveloped by any deterministic arrival curve.
• We extend the linear arrival curve αr,b (t) = rt + b with an excess probability ε as ε-αr,b (t) =
rt + b(ε), where ε reﬂects the probability of trafﬁc burstiness surpassing its arrival curve.
We prove that self-similar trafﬁc can be characterized by the extended linear arrival curve
ε-αr,b .
• Based on the extended self-similar trafﬁc model, we derive delay and backlog bounds
for self-similar trafﬁc served by one or a series of concatenated network elements.
Furthermore, we give closed-form equations to compute the bounds assuming the network
elements are modeled by the latency-rate server (Stiliadis & Varma, 1998).
• We present a performance analysis ﬂow starting from self-similar trafﬁc and ending with
results of delay and backlog bounds.

3. Self-similarity and FBM
In this section we give a deﬁnition of self-similar trafﬁc (Park & Willinger, 2000), describe
the FBM model (Fonseca et al., 2000; Norros, 1995), and introduce the estimation of FBM
parameters, ( ā, σ, H ) (Norros, 1995; Park & Willinger, 2000).
3.1 Self-similarity

Let X (t) denote the trafﬁc volume arriving in the tth time unit. Let A(t) be the cumulative
process indicating the total trafﬁc volume from time 0 up to time t. X (t) is also termed as the
increment process of A(t) as X (t) = A(t) − A(t − 1).
Given a stationary time series X = ( X (t), t = 1, 2, 3, ...), we deﬁne the m-aggregated series
X (m) = ( X (m) (k), k = 1, 2, 3, ...) by summing the original series X over non-overlapping
blocks of size m. The time series process X is called asymptotically second-order self-similar (as-s),
if the autocorrelation function of X (m) and X follows
r (m) (k) ∼ r (k), as m → ∞, k → ∞.

(1)

That is, at all scales the aggregated autocorrelation structures agree asymptotically to the
autocorrelation structure of the entire series X.

The crucial feature of self-similar processes is that they exhibit long-range dependence (LRD).
These LRD processes have an autocorrelation function r (k) that decays with time lag k, i.e.,
r (k) ∼ k−γ as k → ∞, where 0 < γ < 1. The Hurst parameter H is commonly used to
measure the degree of LRD, and is related to the parameter γ by H = 1 − γ/2. In fact, with
1/2 < H < 1, as-s and LRD imply each other, and self-similarity and LRD are often used
interchangeably in practice.
3.2 FBM and its envelope process

Many different models are widely used to represent self-similarity. We use Fractional
Brownian Motion (FBM) (Norros, 1995) to model the cumulative input trafﬁc A(t). The FBM
input { A(t) : t ≥ 0} can be represented by
A(t) = āt + σZ (t),

(2)

where the mean arrival rate E{ A(t)/t} = ā, and σ2 is the variance of trafﬁc in a time unit, and
{ Z (t) : t ≥ 0} is the standard (normalized) FBM process with Hurst parameter H ∈ [1/2, 1).
The basic known property of FBM model is its marginal distribution (Norros, 1995), which
allows computing an envelope process. For an FBM process A(t) with mean ā and variance
σ2 , the envelope process Â(t) can be deﬁned as

√
de f
Â(t) = āt + k σ2 t2H = āt + kσt H ,

(3)

where the parameter k determines the probability that A(t) will exceed Â(t) at time t as
follows:




A(t) − ât

(4)
P A(t) > Â(t) = P
σt H
where Φ(y) is the residual distribution function of the standard
Gaussian distribution, using
√
the approximation Φ(y) = exp(−y2 /2), k is given by k = −2 ln ε.
The FBM envelope process is advantageous: (1) It is parsimonious, i.e., only three parameters
( ā, σ, H ) are required to completely characterize a self-similar source; (2) The input parameters
( ā, σ, H ) can be estimated in real-time from the incoming trafﬁc samples with minimal
computational complexity (Fonseca et al., 2000).
3.3 Estimation of FBM parameters ( ā, σ, H )

The FBM parameters ( ā, σ, H ) can be estimated from a sample of trafﬁc traces. To estimate
ā and σ, we ﬁrst get the trafﬁc cumulative process A(t) from the sample. The mean arrival
rate
 is derived as ā = E{ A(t)/t} and the variance of trafﬁc in a time unit is given as σ =
Var{ A(t)}
(Norros, 1995).
tH
To estimate Hurst parameter H, there are a number of methods: analysis of R/S (Range/Scale,
rescaled adjusted range) statistic, analysis of the variance-time plot, the Whittle estimation
and analysis based on wavelet function (Park & Willinger, 2000). We adopt the R/S method
summarized as follows.

Given a sample
 of n observations in the time series (Xk , k = 1, 2, ..., n), the R/S statistic is
R(n)
denoted as M
∼ cn H as n → ∞ and c is a positive constant. Taking the logarithm of
S(n)


R(n)
∼ H log(n) + log(c) as n → ∞. Thus the H parameter
the two parts gives log M
S(n)
can be estimated by placing the graph of the log{ M[ R(n)/S(n)]} on log(n) and using the
obtained points to select a straight line with slope H based on the least-squares method (Park
& Willinger, 2000).

4. Self-similar trafﬁc model ε-αr,b
In Theorem 1, we prove that a self-similar trafﬁc ﬂow cannot be bounded by any deterministic
function.
Theorem 1. For a self-similar trafﬁc ﬂow, whose FBM envelope process is Â(t) = āt + kσt H , there
does not exist any wide-sense increasing deterministic function α(t) (t > 0) to envelope the ﬂow.
Proof. Using reduction ad absurdum, we assume there exists such α(t) for all t > 0 that α(t) ≥
A(t), hence
(5)
P{ A(t) > α(t)} = 0,
where A(t) denotes the cumulative function of the self-similar trafﬁc ﬂow. For any speciﬁed
time t, the volume of α(t) is deterministic.
Since the self-similar
ﬂow is modeled by FBM, with the concept of the FBM envelope process,
√
we can get k = −2 ln ε when ε → 0, k → ∞.
As ā and σ are all positive and t > 0, there exists some ε∗ > 0 which makes k >
āt + kσt H > α(t), at the same time, P{ A(t) > āt + kσt H } = ε∗ .
Therefore

α(t)
,
σt H

P{ A(t) > α(t)} > P{ A(t) > āt + kσt H } = ε∗ > 0,

i.e.,

(6)

which conﬂicts Eq. (5). This means the condition can not be true, i.e., α(t) does not exist.
Note that, in Theorem 1, α(t) covers any deterministic arrival curve, linear and nonlinear.
However, in order to use NetCal theory for performance analysis of self-similar trafﬁc, we
develop in Theorem 2 an extended arrival curve for self-similar trafﬁc, which is an ε-enhanced
linear arrival curve.
Theorem 2. For a self-similar trafﬁc ﬂow, whose FBM envelope process is Â(t) = āt + kσt H ,
there exists a deterministic linear arrival curve ε-αr,b (t) = rt + b(ε), having values exceeded by
the trafﬁc ﬂow for any t with the upper excess probability ε = Φ(k), where r > ā, b(ε) =
H

H

(r − ā) H−1 (Φ−1 (ε)σ) 1− H H 1− H (1 − H ).
Proof. Since the trafﬁc ﬂow exceeds the arrival curve ε-αr,b with the upper excess probability
ε (0 < ε ≤ 1), we have
P{ A(t) > ε-αr,b (t)} ≤ ε = P{ A(t) > Â(t)},

(7)

hence

ε-αr,b (t) = rt + b(ε) ≥ Â(t) = āt + kσt H .

(8)

(r − ā)t − kσt H + b(ε) ≥ 0.

(9)

By Eq. (8) for all t, we get

Since the Hurst parameter 1/2 < H < 1, Eq. (9) is satisﬁed for the stable case only r − ā > 0,
therefore r > ā.
To proceed further it is sufﬁcient to note that Eq. (9) has to be met for the worst case and
therefore, the minimum value of the left side of Eq. (9) in turn must be equal to zero (as of a
weak inequality).
Let f (t) = (r − ā)t − kσt H + b(ε), in order to compute the minimum value of f min , it is
d f (t)
necessary to ﬁnd t∗ such that
= 0. Hence we have (r − ā) − Hkσt H −1 = 0, t∗ is given

We can see that b(ε) is a function of r (r > ā) and FBM parameters of ( ā, σ, H ). Certainly,
how closely the extended arrival curve constrains the trafﬁc ﬂow is sensitive to the excess
probability ε, which is a measure of majorizing precision.

5. Performance analysis
Using the proposed arrival curve, we derive performance and backlog bounds based on the
concepts of arrival and service curves (Le Boudec & Thiran, 2004).
5.1 General bounds

When a self-similar trafﬁc ﬂow with arrival curve ε-αr,b is processed by a network element
with service curve β, the maximum delay for the ﬂow is bounded by:
D (ε-αr,b , β) = sup inf{τ ≥ 0 : ε-αr,b (t) ≤ β(t + τ )} .
t ≥0

(11)

When a trafﬁc ﬂow is processed by a sequence of network elements, we could simply add
the different maximum delays of each individual component together to obtain an end-to-end
delay guarantee. However, in this case we can exploit the phenomenon known as Pay Bursts
Only Once (Le Boudec & Thiran, 2004), and the end-to-end delay guarantee can be tightened
by:
(12)
D (ε-αr,b , β 1 ⊗ β 2 ⊗ . . . ⊗ β n ).

The maximum buffer size that is required to buffer the trafﬁc ﬂow is bounded by:
B(ε-αr,b , β) = sup{ε-αr,b (t) − β(t)}.

(13)

t ≥0

And when the trafﬁc ﬂow traverses several consecutive elements, the total required buffer
space can even be tightened by:
B(ε-αr,b , β 1 ⊗ β 2 ⊗ . . . ⊗ β n ).

(14)

Note that, strictly speaking, the delay and backlog “bounds” should be interpreted as
“estimates” for maximum delay and backlog. Since the trafﬁc is not entirely constrained by the
arrival curve in our model due to ε, it is possible in theory that the calculated bounds may be
exceeded, even though appearing only in extreme cases. However, to follow the terminology
used in network calculus based performance analysis, we also use “bounds” for the estimated
maximum delay and backlog in the chapter.
5.2 Bounds for latency-rate servers

In addition to the general performance bounds, we give equations to compute the bounds
assuming the latency-rate server model for network elements (Stiliadis & Varma, 1998).
Consider a self-similar trafﬁc ﬂow with arrival model ε-αr,b (t) = rt + b(ε) traversing a series
of network elements, each element i (i = 1, 2, 3, ..., n) guarantees a latency-rate service curve
β Ri ,Ti = Ri (t − Ti )+ , where Ri is the service rate and Ti delay to serve the ﬂow. Notation
x + = x, if x ≥ 0; x + = 0, otherwise.
Let Rmin =

If r > Rmin , the bounds are inﬁnite.
We can see when ε (0 < ε ≤ 1) is approaching to 1, the backlog and delay bounds are
deceasing. In particular, when ε equals 1, the value of b(ε) will be zero and the delay and
buffer bounds will equal to

more bursty trafﬁc exceeds the arrival curve. This is similar to the effect of lowering the trafﬁc
arrival curve. Thus the computed delay and backlog bounds become smaller.
5.3 Performance analysis ﬂow

We illustrate the analysis ﬂow in Figure 1. The input is a trace of self-similar trafﬁc and output
is delay and backlog bound results. The procedure contains four steps:
• Step 1: Estimate FBM parameters ( ā, σ, H ) (Section 3.3). This step checks for self-similarity
in the trace and performs, for example, the R/S analysis, to derive Hurst parameter H.
With this step, we obtain its cumulative process.
• Step 2: Find its FBM envelope process, and further derive its ε-enhanced arrival model
(Section 4).
• Step 3: Model network elements with service curves.
• Step 4: Compute delay and backlog bounds for its traversal through a single node or
concatenated nodes. If the service models follow the latency-rate model, we can use the
closed-form equations in Section 5.2 to compute the bounds.

6. Experiments and results
We devised experiments to (1) validate the proposed self-similar model; (2) show the
correctness and tightness of calculated bounds via comparing them with simulated results.
With the experiments, we also exemplify the performance analysis ﬂow.
6.1 The simulation platform

We use a simulation platform in an open source simulation environment SoCLib (SoCLib
Simulation Environment, n.d.) to collect application traces and to simulate their delay and
backlog in on-chip networks.

Fig. 2. The Simulation Platform.
As shown in Figure 2, the platform contains a MIPS R3000 processor, on-chip memories, a
display component (TTY), and other components such as DSP and DMA. These components
are interconnected with a 3 × 3 mesh network. The network performs wormhole ﬂow control
and uses XY routing. Routers are uniform, taking 5 cycles to deliver head ﬂits and one cycle
for other ﬂits. Application code and data are stored in RAM3. The Network Interfaces (NIs)
encapsulate transactions into ﬂits and de-encapsulate ﬂits into transactions.
We run four embedded multimedia programs on the MIPS: an MP3 audio decoder, an MPEG2
video decoder, a JPEG and a JPEG2000 decoder, respectively. The MP3 processes a 4KB audio
stream, MPEG2 a 176 × 176 video frame, JPEG and JPEG2000 a 256 × 256 image. We set up two
measurement points to observe the transactions between MIPS and RAM3 in the platform, as
indicated in Figure 2. While application code running on the processor, at Point 1 we record
the sequence number and timing of ﬂits generated by MIPS in a trace ﬁle, and at Point 2 we
observe the end-to-end delay experienced by each ﬂit after traversing four routers, {R1, R2,
R3, R4}, and the system backlog.
We have performed analysis and simulation for all the four application traces. For concise
presentation, we only detail the analysis and simulation results of the MP3 application in
Section 6.2 and Section 6.4, respectively. Section 6.3 discusses the derivation of the extended
arrival curves for the MP3 application and the selection of parameters ε and r. Nevertheless,
we report both analysis and simulation results on delay and backlog for all the applications
in Section 6.5. For all results, the unit for delay is cycle, for backlog is f lit. While examining
trafﬁc’s self-similarity, we choose 100 cycles as the time window.
6.2 Analysis for MP3 application

The analysis of the MP3 application follows the four steps described in Section 5.3.
Step 1. The entire trace of MP3 application contains 1,697,249 ﬂits in total and lasts for 46,696
hundreds of cycles as drawn in Figure 3. For such 100-cycle aggregated data series, we use
the R/S analysis method to derive its Hurst parameter as illustrated in Figure 4. It turns
out that H equals 0.86. This means the MP3 trafﬁc exhibits good self-similarity. The FBM

parameters of ā and σ are also derived using the formulas presented in Section 3.3. We
get the mean rate ā = 36.35 ﬂits/100 cycles, and the variance in time unit of 100 cycles
σ = 0.33.
Step 2. Assume the excess probability ε = 1E-4 (1 × 10−4 ), with derived ( ā, σ, H ) =
(36.35, 0.33, 0.86), we have the FBM envelope process Â(t) = 36.35t + 1.417t0.86 . Now
we compute its extended arrival curve of ε-αr,b . Let r = 37 ﬂits/100 cycles > ā, then with
Eq. (10), we get b(ε) = 10 ﬂits, thus ε-αr,b (t) = rt + b(ε) = 37t + 10.
Together with the MP3 cumulative process, the two curves of ε-αr,b (t) and Â(t) are plotted
in Figure 5. As we can see, the derived model ε-αr,b (t) tightly bounds the cumulative
process of the self-similar trafﬁc. This validates the correctness of our proposed self-similar
arrival model.
Step 3. The routers are modeled as latency-rate servers with the same service curve of β(t) =
100(t − 0.05)+ , which represents that the routers delay head ﬂits for 5 cycles and forward
100 ﬂits per 100 cycles.
Step 4. Flits generated by MIPS passing through a tandem of routers {R1, R2, R3, R4} before
arriving at RAM3. Using Eq. (15) and (16), in Section 5.2, the delay and backlog bounds
can be calculated as 30 cycles and 17.4 ﬂits, respectively.

6.3 Discussions on extended arrival curves
6.3.1 Derivation of the extended arrival curves

For the MP3 application, we have obtained ( ā, σ, H ) = (36.35, 0.33, 0.86). Using Equation 10,
we get
√
b(ε) = 0.0554 · (r − 36.35)−6.1429 · (0.33 · −2 ln ε)7.1429 .
(17)
This means that b(ε) decreases as r or/and ε increases. The relation among b, r and ε is shown
in the 3D Figure 6. With a small increase of r from 36.6 to 38, b is approaching 0. With an
increase of ε, b is also decreasing and approaching to 0, but with a relatively less acceleration.
We also give the delay and backlog estimates as follows:
Delay Estimates:
D = 0.0554 · (r − 36.35)−6.1429 · (0.33 ·

√

−2 ln ε)7.1429 + 20.

From the formulas, we can see that D/B decreases as r or/and ε increases, in a similar way as
b(ε). We draw two 3D ﬁgures for the delay and backlog estimates in Figure 7. We can see that
the three ﬁgures are similar in shape.
6.3.2 Selection of ε and r

As can be observed from Figure 6 and 7, the burstiness b, delay and backlog estimates (D
and B) are very sensitive to the value of r > 36.35. Staring from r = 36.5, a small increase
of r sharply reduces b, D and B. We choose r = 37, since, from this point, the curves do not
go down quickly. With this value, we plot a 2D ﬁgure to show how the delay and backlog
estimates vary with ε in Figure 8.

Figure 8 clearly shows that, as ε increases from 1E-6 to 1E-1, the delay and backlog are both
decreasing and the decrease is sharp until ε goes beyond 1E-4. From then on, the decrement
of ε affects the bounds lightly. For smaller ε, the arrival curve allows less ﬂits excess, and
the bounds are certainly calculated larger. “ε = 1E-4 (1 × 10−4 )” means that the tolerance of
exceeding the arrival curve is one out of 10,000 ﬂits. Note that the excess probability ε may
come from application constraints. In such cases, ε is pre-determined and we only need to
consider the relation between r and b.
With ε = 1E-4, we can look closer on how the selection of rate r inﬂuences the delay and
backlog estimates, as shown in Figure 9. While varying r from 36.8 to 38, both the delay
and backlog estimates decrease and the decrease is sharp until r exceeds 37. From then on,
the increase of r affects the bounds lightly. For smaller r, the burstiness b is greater so as to
guarantee that the ε-αr,b envelopes the trafﬁc for a certain excess probability, and the bounds
are consequently calculated larger. Since r = 37 is the turning point, we have chosen r = 37
for the MP3 application.

6.4 Simulation results of MP3 application

We present detailed simulation results for the MP3 application.
Figure 10(a) plots the ﬂit delay for a sequence of 1E+4 (1 × 104 ) ﬂits. The calculated delay
bound (30 cycles) is plotted as a straight line. We can see that there is no point above the
line. Similarly, in Figure 10(b), for the sequence of 1E+4 ﬂits, we plot the backlog value at
each observing time point when a ﬂit arrives at RAM3 and the calculated backlog bound
(17.4 ﬂits) as a straight line. We can see that there are some points above the line, indicating
there exist some points beyond the bound caused by the burstiness of self-similar trafﬁc. This
in fact validates one ﬁnding in this chapter: no deterministic arrival curves can fully bound
self-similar trafﬁc.
Figures 11(a) and 11(b) show the delay and backlog histogram, respectively, for the entire
trace. We ﬁnd the maximum delay is 24 cycles and there are no ﬂits experiencing larger delay
than the bound of 30 cycles, so the excess ratio equals zero. For the backlog, the observed
maximum backlog is 20 ﬂits. There are 6 points in total exceeding the bound of 17.4 ﬂits.
The real exceeding ratio equals 6/1697249 = 3.53E-6, which is far smaller than the assumed

Ds , respectively, and calculated backlog bound and maximum simulated backlog as B and
Bs , respectively. The D and B represent the calculated exceeding ratio of the points beyond
the delay and backlog bound, respectively. From this table, we can see that all the calculated
delay bounds well constrain the simulated delay, i.e., D = 0. The calculated backlog bounds
fail to constrain the maximum observed backlog in simulations. This results in B > 0, but we
can observe B << ε. This means the proposed arrival models are good.

7. Conclusion
Performance analysis techniques must properly characterize trafﬁc ﬂows. In this chapter,
we have presented a trafﬁc arrival model for self-similar trafﬁc, which is a very inﬂuential
category of trafﬁc observed in various networks. This model complies with the linear arrival
model, and enhances it with an additional parameter, excess probability ε, to capture the
probability of bursty trafﬁc surpassing the linear arrival envelope. We develop such a model
because of two reasons. One is that, as we have proved in the chapter, self-similar trafﬁc
cannot be bounded by any deterministic function. The other is that we hope to keep the
elegance of the trafﬁc abstraction in network calculus. With such an ε-enhanced arrival curve,
we have shown how to apply network calculus theory for performance analysis of self-similar
trafﬁc ﬂows. Assuming the latency-rate server model, we give closed-form equations for
computing delay and backlog bounds for self-similar trafﬁc traversing a tandem of network
elements. We have also devised experiments to exemplify the performance analysis ﬂow. Our
simulations with real on-chip multimedia application traces have validated our model and
results.
We have aimed our performance analysis of self-similar trafﬁc for on-chip networks.
However, the arrival-curve-compliant self-similar trafﬁc model and its associated
performance analysis method and formulas are equally applicable to off-chip networks,
since we do not make any NoC-speciﬁc assumptions. Nevertheless, we believe our
approach is most beneﬁcial to the design of NoCs since NoC is a closed system focusing on
speciﬁc application domains whereas trafﬁc can be closely inspected, properly proﬁled and
characterized.

1. Introduction
With the latest computing technology, people can store information including audio, video,
and data on the Internet. And the advanced networking protocol designs can easily enable
interactive communications among users, applications, and services through wireless tablets
and mobile devices (Satyanarayanan, 2001). However, people like to connect to the Internet
while moving, the connectivity may vary during the course of an active session of a user.
Although many portable device can provide high-speed connectivity, a user may move into
area with weak signal or thin bandwidth, which possibly hinder the reception of satisfactory
multimedia trafﬁc. In today’s business, it is important to make sure the satisfaction of content
subscribers. Thus, it is adamant to develop a ubiquitous control framework to offer perceptual
satisfaction of multimedia subscribers.
The ubiquitous computing platform should be designed for quality control of multimedia and
data context through the Internet. The framework should manage the network and computing
resources, such that the delivered information should at least meet the expected minimal
perceptual quality of multimedia trafﬁc stream of an end-user. In this chapter, a few basic
design parameters for justifying the performance and design of the control framework will
be elaborated. Quantitatively, different Quality of Service (QoS) parameters, e.g., packet loss
rate, have been widely used for session transmission control. But for visual evaluation, the
terminology known as Quality of Experience (QoE) has recently been widely used. QoE is a
measure of performance expectations of the end-user; it may augment QoS by providing the
quantitative link to user perception. Indeed, the only way to know how customers see your
business is to look at it through their eyes.
Nowadays, due to the widespread use of mobile devices, the rapidly increasing demand
on network resources impacts the underlying investment on high-performance hardware
devices, which then affects the cost of a network architecture. Then, on the other hand,
higher visual quality can then impact the number of subscribers and subsequently the top
line income of a networking ﬁrm. As a result, a good visual quality control system with
effective utilization of network resources for a networking ﬁrm is desirable. In the following,
we shall elaborate the QoS and QoE design issues. Then a multimedia control framework
will be proposed to offer satisfactory perceptual to ubiquitous multimedia subscribers. Its
improvements will be thoroughly discussed.

2. Visual metrics and control frameworks
2.1 Measuring metrics

From the signal processing algorithmic design, multimedia sessions may consist of voices,
images, videos, and data. Different signal types use different encoding/decoding algorithms
for storage and transmissions. For example, MPEG (Motion Picture Experts Group) is a family
of standards used for coding audio-visual information, e.g., movies, video, music, in a digital
compressed format. The JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group), GIF (Graphic Image File),
BMP (bitmap) are examples of image encoding data formats. Among them, bitmap image
takes more memory spaces with sharper imaging quality because it has 256 quantization
levels for each of the three base colors. An JPEG image is coded with a lossy Discrete Cosine
Transform (DCT). It uses less memory space with a lower visual quality.
Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) is an easy-to-use error measurement metric, and is widely
used for providing quantitative evaluation of receiving multimedia quality. Indeed, the PSNR
ratio is more or less a subjective measurement technique, and it may fail to reﬂect what appear
in images. As shown in Fig. 1, two images with identical PSNRs. But the one shown in
Fig. 1(b) appears to give inferior visual quality (Winker & Mohandas, 2008). This is due to the
local accumulation of errors on some nearby pixels. With the nonlinear functionality of retina
in human vision system, the perceived quality can be drastically misleading. With the errors
spread evenly across all pixels in the image, the one shown in Fig. 1(a) may be considered
with better encoded quality.

(a)

(b)

Fig. 1. Human vision system and images with identical PSNRs (Winker & Mohandas, 2008).
As a result, PSNR may not be able to reﬂect the visual perceptual quality of multimedia
content. That is, some perceptually poor and appealing images may have identical PSNRs
(Grega et al., 2008). At this current moment, there is no conclusive measure that should be
commonly accepted as the right measure for quantifying QoE. Hence, the Mean Opinion
Score (MOS) is then recommended by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
(ITU-T Recommendation P.800, 1996). It is a subjective measure, and a number of users should

rate the quality using a ﬁve-point scale from 1 to 5, inclusively, as listed in Table 1. The MOS
is the arithmetic mean of all individual scores for judging the quality of a delivering video.

Table 1. Mean Opinion Score (MOS).
Then from the perspective of network architectural design, the quality of a transmission
session through the Internet is usually characterized by the term Quality of Service (QoS)
using parameters, such as packet loss rate, transmission bandwidth, queue length, jitter, and
delay etc. Each of these parameters can be used for performance analysis. Currently, there are
a few standardized QoS associated network designs, for example, the Differentiated Service
(Blake et al., 1998) system model through the recommendation of the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF). In general, network operators have to monitor and manage network
resources properly in order to deal with network congestion problems and packet loss issues
so as to meet different QoS requirements. Network-introduced errors may be the sources of
decoded signal errors. For example, as observed from the two rugby team pictures shown in
Fig. 2, both of them suffer identical overall loss conditions in networks. The errors are spread
across all pixels in Fig. 2(a) which gives a more appealing appearance. However, the errors
are localized in Fig. 2(b), which may irritate the acceptance of a subscriber.

(a)

(b)

Fig. 2. Network condition: 1% packet loss rate, 10 ms delay, 50 μs jitter, 500 kbps bandwidth
(Winker & Mohandas, 2008).
Through these observations, QoE and QoS may be related but not in a linear way. What can
be the proper way to assert the quality of online multimedia service? Objective evaluation
methods are simpler because user inputs are usually not required. For example, data
can be retrieved from network-level measurements, e.g., packet loss rate, or media-level
measurements, e.g., PSNR, as the input for quality assessment. However, as discussed, they
may not be able to judge delivered multimedia quality.

The subjective method using MOS for QoE can be a feasible solution. However, each
subscriber may give a completely different MOS result. Furthermore, the same person under
emotional stress can give a completely different score. As a result, we can consult some
nonlinear functional methods for judging delivering visual quality. And some parameters
are not considered in these methods. For example, the loss of volume is not considered
by the Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ), which is recommended by the ITU
for determining the quality of a speech signal, in order to make the model tractable. Also,
the latency between viewers and the video is not considered in Video Quality Measurement
(VQM) model (Rajagopalan, 2010). Higher-order variations, i.e., the burstiness, of end-to-end
delay and loss are not considered in many models for assessing VoIP quality.
Similar to PESQ, there are a few subjective methods that can assist in judging visual quality.
One of the them is called Visual Differences Predictor (VDP). It is used to characterize the
retina response curve. Although the computation complexity is relatively high, it can be used
for quantifying image quality based on a reference image. Details of the VDP design can be
found in Appendix A.
2.2 Examples of quality control frameworks

There are some basic architectural designs (Agarwal et al., 2008; Huang et al., 2008;
Lum & Lau, 2002) for serving multimedia trafﬁc adaptively according to varying network
condition. The common goal is to improve the visual quality of multimedia trafﬁc at
recipients. In (Lum & Lau, 2002), proxy server or intermediate network server is used to relay
and re-adapt information content for changed networking condition. As of today, there are
a large amount of proxy video servers deployed across the Internet today. However, most of
these proxies are for relay purpose only.
As reported in (Agarwal et al., 2008), a controlled testbed for experimenting video trafﬁc
delivery using peer-to-peer (P2P) streaming has been used. The results have indicated that
tested P2P streaming systems carry signiﬁcant overhead (up to 35% over the video stream
size) with an average start-up delay of about 11 sec. Besides, an additional video buffering
time of 30 sec is needed to combat packet arrival jitters for video playback. Despite these
drawbacks, the P2P systems are robust regarding peer churn, and generate larger captured
P2P bandwidth than using an over-provisioned server. Furthermore, they have found that
quantitative measure such as PSNR, which is used among many P2P video streaming research
reports, can not properly reﬂect the QoE.
Another investigation on P2P streaming can be found in (Huang et al., 2008). The paper offers
a generic design framework, and identiﬁes different building blocks in a system, for example,
the ﬁle segmentation strategy, replication strategy, content discovery and management,
piece/chunk selection policy, transmission strategy and authentication. The goal is to achieve
a scalable system with efﬁcient replication strategies for offering user-level satisfaction. A new
ﬂuency index has then been introduced as a performance measure for evaluating the health
of the systems and the user satisfaction. Typically, the index measures the fraction of time
a user spent watching a movie with respect to the total time spent on both the waiting and
watching times. This design closely relies on the underlying network performance, instead of
attempting to interpret and serve different types of content information. That is, the accuracy
of the ﬂuency index regarding perceptual quality has not been examined in the paper.
Then in (Law & Leung, 2003), a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) has been
designed for programmable nodes in networks. This implies nodes on the Internet can

Control Framework for Delivering Perceptual Satisfaction of Multimedia Traffic

255

function together in the form of loosely-coupled computing devices. This indicates that
adaptation of trafﬁc can be made inside the Internet. But the operation details for programs
to execute must be carefully controlled by network and content service providers. In general,
overlay networks provide better security control to network providers and code distribution
ﬂexibility to application providers. However, the response times may be slightly longer than
those with programmable node concepts. For example, BitTorrent is one simple broadcasting
mechanism for code distribution across end-users’ computers, which operate as virtual
network servers. To advance the design, structured overlays, such as using Distributed Hash
Tables (DHTs) (Stoica et al., 2001), can be used.
In (Chen et al., 2009), a proposed framework with QoE consideration known as OneClick
is proposed. Its operations is trivial. The client informs the server system directly regarding
receiving perceptual quality. Upon viewing the multimedia content, when a user ﬁnds the
receiving quality of content annoying, he or she can click certain button repeatedly to indicate
his or her dissatisfaction. Therefore, a session with a larger number of clicks indicates a
poorer receiving perceptual quality. The OneClick design can be considered as a reciprocal of
Mean Opinion Score (MOS) (ITU-T Recommendation P.800, 1996). The OneClick may offer
real-time response to the server system, although it has not been examined (Chen et al., 2009).

3. Multimedia agent framework
A network infrastructure is shown in Fig. 3. Initially the trafﬁc communicating between a
mobile client C and service provider S is traveling over the Path 1 as shown. Upon moving,
the client C may have arrived at another location, and the communicating path has been
switched to Path 2. The associated networking parameters might have completely changed,
for example, the bottleneck link bandwidth and propagation delay, etc. As a result, the
amount of data ﬂow and traveling latency could be completely different, which can then
impact the perceptual quality of receiving multimedia trafﬁc.
Our proposed quality control framework is called Multimedia Agent Framework (MAF). The
goal is to adapt trafﬁc content to changing network constraints dynamically. The foundation
of the framework is based on agent technology. A few basic components are deﬁned for
the system to operate properly. In Fig. 3, a functional connection is consisted of at least a
content provider S, a mobile client C, and two agents, which sit at the edges on the Internet.
Depending on the direction of the trafﬁc ﬂow, the agents are generically named the Ingress
Agent (I A) and Egress Agent (EA). For the depicted trafﬁc ﬂow from a server to a client,
the agents connecting to the source and destination are called ingress agent and egress agent,

respectively. Since wireless connections are not always stable, a mobile client may encounter
different perceptual experiences while traveling. For example, the access bandwidth between
C and egress agent EA2 is 54 Mbps for 802.11g, while the one between C and EA1 can be
11 Mbps for 802.11b. And in this paper, we assume that the bottleneck always occurs at the
wireless link between egress agent and client.
To sustain a satisfactory user experience of a mobile client under changing networking
conditions, trafﬁc context can be adjusted accordingly (Banavar & Bernstein, 2002; Noble,
2000; Lum & Lau, 2002) through the proposed quality control framework. Apart from the
ingress and egress agents, the framework allows content alternation within the Internet upon
permitted by both the content service providers and subscribers. But at the current stage, we
focus on the basic operating model which functions between the two agents.
3.1 Communication model

A traditional client-server transaction model is shown in Fig. 4(a). Suppose that a client tries
to retrieve a web page, which is consisted of one HTML text document, and one picture ﬁle.
Two separate HTTP GET requests from the client can be used to obtain the two ﬁles from the
server. But in multimedia agent framework, a high-level conceptual design feature is enabled
through the two agents, as shown in Fig. 4(b). Upon receiving the HTTP GET request from
client, the egress agent also delivers information regarding the associated resource constraint
of the wireless link to the ingress agent. Then the ingress agent can represent the client to
collect both ﬁles and examine if the latest available resources are sufﬁcient to receive both
ﬁles in perfect condition. If not, the ingress agent can adjust the ﬁle context to meet the latest
available QoS constraints for the client.
To have the framework worked as expected, structural control message ﬂows between the
egress and ingress agents have been designed. And these control messages are called
“capsules” messages. In order to create a lightweight and effective design, multiple operating
phases are introduced, which include: initialization, QoS negotiation, and provision phases.
When a client moves from one access point to another access point, packets may be lost
temporarily due to incorrect routing. This error can be reduced if the path change indication
can be saved within the Internet. At the moment, this layer 3 operation is not investigated in
this paper. Our current focus is on the changes of resource constraints, whereas multimedia
information may not be able to provide the expected quality at the recipient.
For a newly moving-in mobile user, an egress agent may not be aware of any existing active
connections. It starts to take notice, if this client sends a new request, retransmits a request,
or the agent receives an incoming redirected messages from a server through the mobile IP
protocol (Perkins, 2002; Johnson et al., 2004; Law & Lau, 2010). In either of these cases, the
egress agent should start an initialization phase. That is, the egress agent attempts to establish
and register a relationship with the corresponding ingress agent. The next stage is to begin a
negotiation phase. At the current stage, the information being passed between the agents is
for QoS monitoring. This enables the ingress agent to make decision on service class selection
with an estimated performance for a speciﬁc trafﬁc type. In future, information regarding
service subscription should be integrated. This indicates that the right of use of a service class
must also be veriﬁed if it is covered in its paid services. Then afterward, based on measured
QoS parameters, the ingress agent makes decision if any modiﬁcations should be applied to
the trafﬁc, which should be delivered with satisfaction expectation of the subscriber. The role

of QoS monitoring plays an important role in determining the method of adaptations which
should be carried out.
With the ubiquity of wireless devices, browsers have been the common tools for accessing
different information on the Internet. It becomes naturally and important that the multimedia
agent framework should start extending the protocol into REpresentational State Transfer
(RESTful) model in future.
3.2 Delivering content adaptation

The multimedia agent framework can tailor the content to meet the QoE expectations
of subscribers. At the moment, content adaptations are carried out at the edges of the
Internet, i.e., the ingress and egress agents. The adaptation should depend on the business
contract between content and network providers, which may be outside the scope of this
chapter. Collectively, we call these nodes the adaptation nodes. For carrying out meaningful
operations in these nodes, then a number of information must be learnt and communicated
among the ingress and egress agents. As shown in Fig. 5, the types of information should
include: 1) user’s QoE expectations, 2) properties of content material, 3) latest network status,
4) available network access interfaces of devices.

Fig. 5. Decision parameters.
3.3 User preferences and expectation

In order for the infrastructure to work seamlessly and meet the QoEs of subscribers,
their preferences and expectations should be set at the initial phases and passed back to
the content providers. The associated agents can obtain this information for adaptation
purpose, if needed. There are certainly other methods available for this type of information
retrieval, e.g., the Service Level Agreement (SLA) through policy-based management. The
capability description can follow the deﬁned syntax structure, such as the Composite
Capability/Preference Proﬁle (CC/PP) from World-wide Web Consortium (W3C), or Media
Feature Sets from IETF.

Some parameters can assist the network to adapt to the QoE expectation of the multimedia
trafﬁc:
• Does a subscriber want the content to be retrieved as quickly as possible?
– In video streaming, signiﬁcant variations in delivery time result in jerky video and
choppy audio. The resulting video has a lower QoE value than a smoothly playback
video.
• Does the subscriber want the critical content to be retrieved unfailingly?
– Ranking or priority of content may be desirable.
For multimedia information, more thorough query should be carried out. Questions may have
to be asked regarding, for example, the acceptable choices for picture sizes and compression
granularities, etc. These collected data can then be combined into a set of meta-information.
3.4 Content: meta-information

The purpose of having meta-information in the setting is to assist all components in the
framework to parse and retrieve desired parameters as quickly as possible. For data ﬁles,
meta-information may contain ﬁle size, version, title, language, and authors. For multimedia
content, additional meta-information may include minimal required and desired transmission
bit rates, display size, compression ratio, and encoding methods. These extra data can assist
the adaptation agents to carry out appropriate operations, if needed. Extensible Markup
Language (XML) can be a possible choice for embedding the meta-information regarding the
requirements of services and QoEs of subscribers.
3.5 Network status

In general, it is common to characterize a network path between two end-systems using
available channel bandwidth, end-to-end delay (or round-trip delay), and packet loss rate.
With adaptation capability, computation power can be added to indicate if an adaptation
node can handle a large number of connections simultaneously. The agents in network may
offer computation services for information being delivered from a sender to a receiver. These
parameters are the traditional network layer QoS parameters.
3.5.1 Delays and available resources

For the framework to operate smoothly, we should establish methods to measure available
resources in the networks. For example, in a client-server model, packets from server are
relayed from one node to other until they reach the egress node that the client is connecting
to. In the following, we examine different delay components incurred along the network
infrastructure. A packet has to spend times and delays while traveling through nodes and
links along the path, respectively. The delay components are additive, and the aggregate
delay across the networks is the summation of delay values in various nodes and connecting
links. Typically, four different types of delays are introduced in networks:
• Propagation delay, f Gi , for a link i;
• Transmission delay, f T (s, B ), for packet size s and available bandwidth B;
• Processing delay, f C (c p , cb , s), where c p for incoming packet processing, cb for outgoing
interface determination given a packet with size s;
• Queuing delay, f Q j , for the queue at node j.

30

The total one-way delay across the networks is the summation of all these delay components
of all nodes and links along a path, as shown in (1). With these parameters, other network
characteristics such as bandwidth and computation power can be implicitly reﬂected in the
transmission and processing delay components, respectively.

3.6 Adaptation for real-time delivery

Subscribers always expect information being retrieved should arrive brieﬂy after they click
the service requests. But they have no idea if they have moved into regions with poor
connectivities. Real-time communications are more desirable features for some mobile users,
e.g., stock traders. Therefore, in this case, the content carried by the late arrivals of these
packets may become unimportant. Hence, in the framework, a parameter W is known as
“expected real-time constraint.” A subscriber should set the W according to his or her limit
of patience on waiting time in the user preference proﬁle; if not, it can be assigned to certain
default wait time in system.
Suppose there is a connection being established between a subscriber and a server. A
proper path has already determined in the initial setup phase and meta-information has been
exchanged. If the total round-trip delay between the client and server is T, such that the
forwarding and returning delays are identical, then we have T = 2TD from Eqn. (1). The
expected real-time constraint of a client should not be shorter than the round-trip delay, i.e.,
W < T; otherwise, the retrieved multimedia content can never meet the QoE of the subscriber.
In the case that W > T, the TD may vary due to other trafﬁc in networks. It may have chances
to violate the real-time constraint requirement. In this scenario, the agent in the framework
acts and attempts to adapt the content in order to meet the W requirement. For example,
a sudden change of connecting speed, for example, from wired to wireless access link, has
happened. Then content adaptation should be carried out in the network core, for example,
by reducing the amount of multimedia trafﬁc with compression and reduced frame size, in
order to meet the real-time constraint. For example, the packet size has been modiﬁed, and
the ﬁnal delivered packet size is changed from s to s A bytes when it reaches the subscriber.
In general, many multimedia session is composed of more than one trafﬁc stream. In the
example shown in Fig. 6, there are three trafﬁc types in one session, and the importance
of each of them is ranked. The rank 1 trafﬁc may contain critical data of size 6,600 bytes;
the rank 2 trafﬁc may contain compressible multimedia trafﬁc; and the rank 3 trafﬁc carries
unimportant data trafﬁc. The ideal curve indicates that the available bandwidth changes
linearly. When there is sufﬁcient bandwidth, all trafﬁc in this session can get the network
without any adaptations, i.e., when bandwidth is larger than or equal to 50,000 bytes. But
the available bandwidth starts decreasing linearly, the rank 3 data trafﬁc should be removed,
and then the rank 2 multimedia trafﬁc should be adapted. The size reduction of the rank
2 trafﬁc due to adaptation is not continuous. This hence leads to the staircase structure as
shown. When the available bandwidth is small and then only the rank 1 critical data trafﬁc
must always be kept for delivery. This happens in this graph when s A is below 6,600 bytes,
and both the ideal and real curves should stay ﬂat.

4. Testbed evaluation
A testbed consists of ten nodes has been set up to validate the QoS control framework
for multimedia trafﬁc. Experiments have been carried out to conﬁrm if the proposed QoS
control framework can adapt trafﬁc content to meet the expectation of subscriber. One set of
experiments is to examine the delivery of web pages with real-time information component.
Another set of experiments is to adapt video stream to meet the link bandwidth constraint in
real-time. For both experiments, classiﬁcation of trafﬁc types have been preset for carrying
out expected component adaptation accordingly.
4.1 Real-time delivery of web pages

In this set of experiments, a web page consists of multiple informative components is sent
every 2.5 seconds. As listed in Table 2, these components are pre-classiﬁed into three
ranking classes based on their relative importance. Rank 1 information is considered the most
important, and it should be sent to the subscriber whenever possible. Then there is a picture
in the page. It belongs to rank 2 class, and can be compressed with lower resolutions upon
needed. The other rank 3 components in the HTML page are for creating an appealing look of
the page only. They are not as important and can be dropped if resources are running low.
During the experiments, the ingress agent computes the desired adapted size, s ADAPTED , after
learning the limiting bottleneck bandwidth through receiving the result capsules from the
associated egress agent. Measured data are averaged through the last 100 samples. Certainly,
wireless access link bandwidth varies due to the mobility of the user, which is simulated
through changing the Linux trafﬁc control function. Different access bandwidths are used
for testings, which include 115 kbps, 1 Mbps, and 2.4 Mbps. Furthermore, we have imposed
different real-time constraints for the delivery of this web page information. The patience
limit of a user is interpreted as the real-time delivery constraint. For the tests, the constraints
with values of 1000, 800, 600, and 400 msec are used in testbed. This limit setting indicates
that the user shall re-click or reload the page when the time is reached. This is the goal of the
framework to deliver at least the rank 1 trafﬁc to the subscriber within this time constraint.

In Fig. 7(a), the measured s ADAPTED is shown under different user patience limits and
bottleneck bandwidth. Fig. 7(b) is obtained by dividing the measured s ADAPTED with the
bottleneck link bandwidth, thereby giving the bottleneck link traversal duration values. When
selective delivery is triggered, the bottleneck link traversal time remains constant while the
bandwidth is shrinking. This trend continues until only the rank 1 component is delivered.
Thus, the bottleneck link traversal is the reciprocal of the bottleneck bandwidth multiplied
by the size of the rank 1 component. Fig. 7(c) shows the resultant response time across the
networks. If there is no limit on the patience threshold, the response time exponentially
increases when the bottleneck bandwidth linearly decreases. In fact, when the bottleneck
bandwidth is reduced to 100 kbps, the response time surges to 12, 016 ± 339 msec due to the
exponential increase in the backlog of data waiting to be delivered to the client at the last-mile
link.
The response time characteristics under various user patience limits are similar. In general, the
response time increases exponentially when the bottleneck bandwidth decreases. This trend
continues until they reach their respective adaptation thresholds. From then on, the response
time decreases linearly with the reduction of bandwidth. When the bandwidth decreases even
further, the response time reaches a point beyond which ranks 2 and 3 in-page components
are dropped. The response time stays ﬂat at about 150 milliseconds.
4.2 Real-time delivery of images

The next set of experiments is to delivery images across networks. The bottleneck link is the
access link of a subscriber. The real-time constraint W is passed from the client preference list
to the server, and it can be discovered by the agents in networks. They can detect the existent
of real-time constraint of a communication session, and the delivery of images based on the
meta-information. If there are multiple good quality paths existing between the two agents,
the ingress agent can then have multiple choices in carrying out appropriate operations inside
the infrastructure. An exemplary operational details of using a single path computation in the
infrastructure is shown in Fig. 8. The goal of the infrastructure is to ﬁt the image delivery to
receiver within the duration of W sec.
The image scaling operation starts when the ingress agent receives the incoming Lena BMP
images, as shown in Fig. 9(a). In the experiments, the ingress agent converts them into JPEG
images, forwards them along a path, and the running times are measured against the time
constraints. Regularly, the egress agent reports the measured bottleneck link bandwidth to
the ingress agent. Through the measurements, the image compression ratio can be estimated
through operations in the infrastructure. Different scaling parameter, λ, can be set between
1 and 16 inclusively, where 16 is the best quality and 1 is the worst. The next question is to
determine if the generated images with selected compression ratio can meet the real-time and
bandwidth constraints. Then it leads to design of an initial calibration process. The goal of the
process is to ﬁnd the lowest acceptable bound of the compression ratio for a subscriber.

Table 3. Visual quality and R RMS (C, R).
With different compression ratios, sizes of resulting compressed images are listed in Table 3.
For example, the visual qualities of some compressed images are shown from Fig. 9(b)
to Fig. 9(j). Through the initial calibration process, a subscriber can actually select the
worst quality image that he or she can accept, and inform the content provider. With this
information, the infrastructure can then be aware of the minimum QoE expectation of the
subscriber. And from the Table, an ingress agent can pick a lowered but acceptable bounding
value of the compression scaling parameter to meet the latest networking conditions, if they
have just turned worse. There are two parameters that should be considered before carrying
out compression operations. The ﬁrst one is to determine if the real-time constraint can be met.
The second is to determine if the image quality can meet the quality expectation of a user. Both
conditions must be met; otherwise, the images are dropped at ingress agent, because there are
no good reasons to send an unacceptable low quality images.

4.3 Real-time delivery of streaming content

Multimedia applications, such as IPTVs, and online conference meetings, belong to the
real-time streaming trafﬁc class with temporal relationship among sending information.
Typically, a streaming movie session may consist of three trafﬁc types: video, voice, and/or
data such as the subtitle. Actions are spread across multiple consecutive video frames. Apart
from the blocking effects in images, video motion may not be reconstructed properly if some
motion vectors for decoding are lost. As a result, subscriber could have trouble interpreting
the video content. When a video is transmitted across networks, some video frames can be
dropped. Then, long overdue frame group not displaying at all causes viewer waiting for
long delay, and the the content may appear out-of-order. Hence, when there are more frames
dropped, the reproducing video becomes jerky and gives poor perceptual interpretation.
It is important that our proposed framework can offer satisfactory experience of real-time
video delivery. In the experiments, video frames are extracted from a theatrical screen

advertisement promoting the 1955 Chevrolet models. The advertisement movie has long
sequences of car movements. Inter-frames smoothness can be observed easily, and the
perceived quality can be assessed easily.
For demonstration purpose, this movie clip does not carry voice component which is actually
replaced by subtitle. Each frame in video is a 24-bit RGB bitmap image with a size of 63,414
bytes and a visual dimension of 176 × 120 pixels. The sizes of the accompanying subtitles
range from 97 to 120 bytes. Compression ratio may differ frame by frame depending on
the networking conditions. With the highest compression ratio, compressed frame images
have sizes ranging from 8,806 bytes (13.89% of the originals) to 12,674 bytes (19.99%). Two
frames are extracted every second for creating one new accompanying subtitle. Eighty-eight
frames are extracted. At the server, the video clip is replayed continuously in the experiments.
The relationship between compressed size and compression scaling parameter, λ, is encoded
using meta-information. Thus, the network infrastructure can efﬁciently choose the closest
adapted size, s A , with an appropriate compression parameter λ. Then the network nodes
execute compression operations according to λ. The real-time delivery scheme of the video
experiment is based on a 2-level ranking levels: 1) subtitle is classiﬁed as rank 1, R1 , 2) frame
image is classiﬁed as rank 2, R2 ; where rank 1 has higher priority than rank 2 trafﬁc.

For video communication, the ingress agent can have choices on delivering frames across
the networks. Depending on the latest measured network conditions, the agent can send
frames unchanged, compressed, or simply drop the frames. Certainly, frames sent may still
get dropped inside the networks due to congestion, and these are called frame lost events.
Two snapshots of the movie are shown in Fig. 10(a) and 10(b). When the network delay is too
long with a real-time delay constraint being applied. Then frames are dropped at the ingress

agent to reduce the trafﬁc load in testbed. For example, as shown in Fig. 10(c), the movie
is stuck at frame number 50, but the subtitle has arrived at frame 56. This implies that the
proposed pervasive infrastructure can enforce certain minimal QoS quality. In this case, the
receiver is still able to see the latest subtitle section, or he or she can listen to the voice part
if the voice section exists. An MPEG-1 viewer at the subscriber has been created to compare
a locally stored copy with the remotely retrieving video. The viewer, as shown in Fig. 10(d),
also reports the packet loss and CPU consumption.
For performance measurements, the link speed of the simulated wireless access shrinks from
3 Mbps to 100 kbps. With different real-time constraints applied, different operations on video
frames have been carried out. If bandwidth is abundant, frames are sent uncompressed, as
in all constraint cases with link speed of 3 Mbps. But when the link rate reduces, and the
real-time constraints is shorter, then more frames are compressed, or dropped. It is always
important to observe that, for the cases reported in Fig. 11, the amount of frame losses inside
the networks are small. This satisﬁes the goal of the proposed QoS control framework for
multimedia trafﬁc, that is, to deliver as much information as possible to the subscribers.

5. Conclusion
In this chapter, an agent-based quality control framework for delivering satisfactory
multimedia trafﬁc across the Internet has been designed. The framework is currently built
on top of existing networking protocols. The major components in the platform consists of
ingress and egress agents. QoS monitoring capsules are regularly sent between agents in order

to enable the ingress agent to adapt the content information, while meeting the requirements
and expectations of subscribers and end-users. At the current phase, communicating protocol
designs between the two agents at the edges of networks have been tested. Furthermore,
different trafﬁc types have been thoroughly experimented. Through multimedia content
classiﬁcation, whether it is for real-time or non-real-time, important or unimportant, trafﬁc
can be sent to subscribers to meet their expected multimedia quality in our framework. And
in future, more thorough investigation shall be carried out to enable routers inside the Internet
to assist and relieve the loads of the ingress and egress agents.

6. Appendix A: Visual difference predictor
One possible ﬁlter responsive function is called Visual Differences Predictor (VDP) (Daly,
1993), which can be adopted to model the retinal sensitivity of human being. The retinal
response to luminance is a non-linear function, and it is used to evaluate the quality of
distorted images. Algorithm derived for VDP attempts to indicate the probability of detecting
a difference between the two images on a pixel-by-pixel basis. In our testing, we have adopted
a simpliﬁed VDP version using a relative mean calculation. These computations may not be
needed to run at all times; the image difference computations can be carried out during quality
calibrations or upon user requests.
The luminous response, l (i, j) shown in (2), is called amplitude non-linearity value,
l (i, j) =

L (i, j)
L (i, j) + c1 ( L (i, j))b

(2)

where L (i, j) is the luminance of the pixel (i, j) in dimension cd/m2 . Typically assigned values
for the parameters b and c1 are 0.63 and 12.6, respectively. Spatial frequencies f l (u, v) can be
obtained through the Fast Fourier Transform of the luminance sensitivity spatial pattern l (i, j).
It gives the magnitude at horizontal spatial frequency at u and vertical spatial frequency at v.
Human being is aware of changes in signal contrast. The contrast sensitivity function (CS ) is
used to model the retinal contrast sensitivity to a spatial frequency.
CS (u, v) =(0.008 z−1.5 + 1)−0.2 ×

√
√
√
1.42 z e−0.3 z × 1 + 0.06e0.3 z

(3)

where z = u2 + v2 .
The CS , in (3), gives a two-dimensional spatial frequency plane (u, v). As shown in (4), the
CS function ﬁlters the f l (u, v) values and obtains the parameter Filtered Magnitudes of the
Amplitude Non-Linearity Value (FMANLV), g(u, v). The g(u, v) measures the luminance
sensitivity ﬁltered by the retinal response with respect to the spatial frequency (u, v), which is
g(u, v) = f l (u, v) ∗ CS (u, v).

(4)

A.1 Calibration operations

There are no needs to run these computations in real-time. In the proposed platform, the
framework can initiate an initial calibration phase between subscriber and content provider.
In other words, the ingress and egress agents can subsequently set appropriate preferences for
a subscriber.

The multimedia content provider may send a reference image R with a reference gR (u, v)
value. Then it sends other compressed testing image, C, with gC (u, v) at the recipient under
the assumption of certain network conditions. Suppose this is the least accepted quality of
a subscriber, then the egress agent can compute a relative image metric through normalizing
the gC (u, v) of the test image with respect to the gR (u, v) of reference image. The resulting
measure is called the relative root-mean square (RMS) error of the reference content,

∑u,v ( gC (u, v) − gR (u, v))2
R RMS (C, R) =
× 100%.
(5)
∑u,v gR (u, v)2
A smaller R RMS (C, R) value indicates that the received image is visually closer to the original
one. This quality bound of a streaming multimedia content can be set through ﬁnding the
largest accepted R RMS (C, R) value of a content subscriber. This bounding measure is returned
to the ingress agent for determining appropriate compression operations in future.

1. Introduction
Most of navigators for mobile devices have a big failure; they do not notify the user of road
condition (traffic, checkpoints, car accidents, road work) unless the user has some kind of
paid subscription. Even in this case the only information that are provided are about traffic.
Many famous Navigators notify user of traffic using sensors under the road, but it is not a
real time update. Besides there is virtually no way to notify user of car accidents or
checkpoints at real time, user usually downloads POIs (Points of Interest) from Internet and
uploads them to the Navigator which will display them on the map.
Road condition change very frequently so POIs should be updated faster so that an user can
decide to take another road to avoid traffic, to reduce pollution, to save time. An humble
application like this can also be used in a very useful way to get our life better!
The purpose of this work has been to study and develop a way that displays updated POIs
on a map. Thanks to the Web 2.0 philosophy the best way that has been found is to allow
users to report any events on the road. Users can also report if an event no longer exists so
that markers on the map can be updated in the fastest and most accurate way possible.
Because of high interaction between users, this application is like a Social Network where
the relationship between users are based on GPS positions.
Mobile devices are obviously the best devices to do that, thanks to their integrated GPS
sensor and to the easy development environment like Android SDK. Android has been
chosen because it is completely open source and because it is a Google OS and it can be used
in the best way in conjunction with Google Maps.

2. Environment
2.1 MOBILE WEB 2.0
World Wide Web was born in 1993 and in the latest 20 years there is a completely new way
of using it. After Web 2.0 philosophy has developed since 1999, new technologies and new
ways of approaching the Internet were born.
In Web 1.0 Users could only access website to retrieve information. These information were
written by the webmaster and read by the users. Web 2.0 introduced a fast change of
approach. Contents were created not only by webmasters, but also by the users. Broadband
connection helped a lot users to connect to the Internet and to publish their contents.

44

Advanced Topics in Multimedia Research

Websites like Wikipedia, YouTube and Flickr had a large impact on World Wide Web.
developments of Web 2.0.
We can say that the biggest differences between Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 are the following:







Web 1.0 was about reading, while Web 2.0 is about writing;
Web 1.0 was about client-server, while Web 2.0 is about peer to peer;
Web 1.0 was about wires, while Web 2.0 is about wireless;
Web 1.0 was about home pages, while Web 2.0 is about blogs;
Web 1.0 was about web forms, while Web 2.0 is about web applications;
And many others…

Users started to share their thoughts, their ideas and their multimedia content on these
websites and they start to interact between each other more and more. In 1997 this
interaction had a blast when Social Network like Facebook started to have a lot of users.
A Social Network is a social structure made up of individuals which are connected by one or
more interdependency, like friendship in Facebook. It is important to notice how much
Social Network are used nowadays.
Between the end of 2007 and the beginning of 2008 mobile devices with Apple OS and
Android OS entered the market. A new kind of Web was born; everything that could be
done in our home in front of a PC could be done everywhere by using a smartphone.
Besides new technologies created new ways to use the Internet. GPS Sensor embedded in
the smartphone could help locate the user’s position so navigation via satellite could be
done by simple smartphones instead of ad hoc navigator (like TomTom).
In 2011 smartphones sales beat PC sales for the first time in history. It is an important
change, we are not talking about Web 2.0, but we are in the Mobile Web 2.0 era.
2.2 Android
Android is an operating system for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet. It
consists in a Kernel based on Linux Kernel, with middleware, libraries and APIs written in
C and application software running on application framework which includes Java
compatible libraries. Uses the Dalvik Virtual Machine to run compiled Java Code.
Current version is now the 3.2 Honeycomb released in July,2011, which is an incremental
release that adds new capabilities like zoom-to-fill screen compatibility mode; capability to
load media files directly from the SD card.
It uses SQLite to store datas, OpenGL ES 2.0 for 3d Graphics. It includes GPS Sensor,
Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnetomer, Proximity and Pressure Sensor, Thermometers.
Supports multi-touch and Bluetooth and is multitasking.
It provides an Eclipse Tool inside the SDK to help developer program in Eclipse Environment.

3. Application
The application is divided into 2 smaller applications:

Mobile Application GPS-Based

1.

2.

45

Android Application: it is on the mobile device and it displays current information on
Google Maps, allows user to report any events by tapping the map, updates Social
Network status.
Server Application: it communicates with the DB where all the information about users
and events are stored. Android Application and Server Application communicate
between them with a SSL connection.

3.1 Android application
It is the biggest and most important part of the entire application. It uses Android SDK API
to manage the GPS Sensor, Google Maps API to show the Map powered by Google Maps, to
display the markers about events on the Map. The other classes must send information to
the Server or to Facebook/Twitter App.
The first and most important part is acquiring the User’s Location. It’s important to manage it
properly because the aim is to get the most accurate location and use the least battery possible.
Android utilizes GPS and Android's Network Location Provider to acquire the user
location. Although GPS is most accurate, it only works outdoors, it quickly consumes
battery power, and doesn't return the location as quickly as users want. Android's Network
Location Provider determines user location using cell tower and Wi-Fi signals, providing
location information in a way that works indoors and outdoors, responds faster, and uses
less battery power.
Obtaining user location from a mobile device can contain errors and be inaccurate due to:




Multitude of location sources: determining which to use and trust between GPS, CellID, and Wi-Fi;
User movement: location changes and we need to re-estimating user location every so
often;
Varying accuracy: a location obtained 10 seconds ago from one source might be more
accurate than the newest location from another or same source.

Android provides a best performance model to obtain user location:

Fig. 1. Timeline representing the window in which an application listens for location updates
The application will start listen to location updates just after it started. After a certain
amount of time the application will come back to listen to updates and will estimate the best
location between the old one and the one just retrieved.

46

Advanced Topics in Multimedia Research

The best way to get the most accurate location is to use the API method getAccuracy(). This
method returns the accuracy of the fix in meters. If for example this method returns an
Accuracy value of 50, it means that user is in a 50 meters radius from the position that is
shown on the map.
However if we want a location to be the most accurate possible, we have to use a lot of
battery, so we should save some of our battery and have a less accurate location.
There are several tricks we can use to save device battery which is fundamental in this
application:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Reduce the size of the window above in which we listen to location updates, less time
the GPS sensor will be on the less battery will be used;
Using a last known location to increase the speed the location is shown on the map
(every first time the application is launched, it takes a while to get a fix of the current
location, because the GPS sensor must connect to several satellites);
Requesting location updates less frequently;
Use just one of the two providers (GPS and Network).

Obviously these tricks have a con: they don’t help us to get a very accurate location. But the
objective is to have the application works for a long time.
To achieve the most valuable result this application uses the following algorithm to save
device’s battery:
1.
2.
3.

Check if the retrieved location is more recent than the one we are using by getTime();
Check if the retrieved location has a better Accuracy than the one we are using by
getAccuracy();
Check which provider is more dependable and use a location retrieved by that provider.

Fig. 2. Algorithm to choose the best location saving battery.
The problem is when the GPS sensor is off or when there is no GPS signal (i.e. when we are
in buildings). The Android Network Provider will first get the Cell ID and then will send it
to google server, which maps such Cell IDs and the server will return a latitude and

Mobile Application GPS-Based

47

longitude. In this case accuracy is usually very low, for example 1000 meters. By this time
Android will also try to see all WiFi networks in the area and will send information about
them too to the google server and if possible google server will return a new location with
higher accuracy for an example 800 meters. It is very important to notice that the Network
Provider requires an internet connection. So if the user is in a building and there is no data
connection, he will never be able to get a location.
Once the application has the user’s location, it will connect to the server and download the
list of events and their location and it will show a map centered in the user’s location and
will display the markers of the events that are around him, as shown in the next figure.

The user can tap on any of these events to see more information or delete them if he realizes
that the reported event is no more in that location.

Events like car accidents will be automatically deleted by the server after 24 hours after they
have been reported.
If an user wants to report a new event, he can tap twice on the map and the application will
ask him what kind of event he is reporting. After that the application will compose a
message and send an update request to the server.

The application can show position of user’s friends (after downloading the friend list from
Facebook). The information that an user can see by tapping on a people marker are name and
phone number and he can decide to call or text his friend from inside the app. The application
will also notify the user if any of his friends is close to him so that he can call them.

It is also important to give the user the chance to manage his privacy, so he can decide
which markers he wants to see and he can decide if he wants his friends to see his location
on their Map. Besides he can also decides if he wants to share his reports on Social Network
like Facebook and Twitter.
Thanks to Android API, it is possible to check the speed an user is moving using the GPS
Sensor so the application can understand by itself if there is traffic on the road. Obviously
there is the chance that the user has momentarily stopped and there is not traffic, so if the
speed decreases for a certain time under 15 km/h the application will ask the user if he is in
a traffic jam. In case of a positive answer (user will see a dialog and will just have to click a
YES or NO button) the application will update the server with the location of a traffic jam.

One of the big problem is that the original MapView doesn’t allow the user to add anything
on it, but it only handles zoom in/out. The idea was to handle three different types of
interaction between user and screen:
1.
2.
3.

One single tap on a marker that opens a dialog with information about the event
Two taps on the map to open a dialog from which user can choose what kind of event
report
Zoom in/out in the same way of all the other smartphones, using two fingers.

Login into the applications is very simple, Android stores user’s Google credentials and the
application uses them to retrieve user info, like name and friends.

52

3.2 Server application
This application must communicate with the application on the mobile device. It will receive
data about new or old (if they have to be removed) events and it will update the DB. Every
type of event has its own table in the DB, and every record has latitude, longitude,
date/time and id of the user that has reported it. The People Table is a little more articulate
because it has also the Facebook friend list and all the permissions the user has granted.
The events that the server application must handle are:





Mobile device notifies user’s data to the server;
Mobile device notifies its location to the server;
Mobile device requests to retrieve events’ list;
Mobile device requests to update events’ information.

4. Conclusion
This application overcomes many limitations of Navigator and Social Network. It can be
seen as a point of union between a Navigator and a Social Network. It proves the use of GPS
not only for user’s advantages but for more people because reports about road condition can
be seen also by people that don’t use the application but have access to user’s
Facebook/Twitter profile.
It helps users to avoid traffic and to choose another road so it can be useful not only to
reduce traffic but also to reduce pollution and to protect environment.
Its strength and at the same time limitation is the fact that it is a mobile application. So it can
completely use the GPS but that means it will use a lot of battery. If battery duration will
increase, this kind of application could be on every mobile device and a lot of other markers
could be added.
In future there can be a lot of good developments, for example it can be useful use vocal
commands to report events. It could also be implemented VOIP and data connection
between users. The limitation of these future developments is in the lack of APIs by Android
and programs for VOIP like Skype.

“Social connections are one of our hallmarks. It has often been considered that these
connections are what distinguish us from animals or the lack of civilization.” N.A.
Christakis, J. H. Fowler
1. Introduction
The value of social networking for business isn't so clear but in other areas it has been very
advanced, as in the world of collaborative research and business at the international level,
can affect joint enterprise (enterprise-level) is displayed as shown in the results of the
collaboration project Networking between MIT and the UPV (http://mitupv.mit.edu) and
UPV and AIMME1 (http://www.metal20.org/).
Most of the measurable benefits such as improved collaboration and multimedia
documentation are already in place. In terms of all the components of social networking,
being on a single platform, we already have that, too, in the form of unified communications
(UC).

2. "MIT-UPV exchange"
This experience is a Web-based co-operative learning project between the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT) in the USA and the Universidad Politécnica de Valencia
(UPV) in Spain which has been underway since 2000. Its aim is to put in contact
technological students in Valencia (Spain) and technological students in Boston (USA) by
means of a jointly developed interactive website. This website is an open platform that
allows the registered students to interact with each other; building a technological social
networking not only by using text-based messages (including a built-in chat facility), but
also by uploading and downloading multimedia files, i.e. videos and graphics created by
the students themselves. The contents of the website are updated in real time and are fully
developed and controlled by the participating students themselves, so as to reflect their
interests, views and other cultural and social components.

2.1 Project’s rationale
The Internet, in general, and the World Wide Web, in particular, represent an emerging
medium for teaching, and their significant potential for the teaching/learning in a
collaborative format. In order to put the impact of Web 2.0 in general and particularly the
social networking into perspective from a future societal standpoint (for the students), it
must first be seen from the context of how the next generation of services that are available
online, specifically designed for ensuring a high degree of collaboration, information
sharing, and support for knowledge-based.
Such projects are aligned with the demands of what Manuel Castells called network society.
The living environment that we have outside the classroom, in a visual world that is
increasingly more technologized, makes the number of inputs of information and knowledge
received outside the classroom far exceeds the amount received in them. Such a large amount
of knowledge and information our students do not receive in an organized manner, in contrast
to received wisdom within their educational time sequences where the transmission of
knowledge is much more organized and regulated. Nowadays, it is a reality that media
communication and human relations at a distance and through the network are a universal
phenomenon in almost all over the world to a greater or lesser extent. This fact and the
circumstances have to be assumed by the educational process and its human componentsmostly the teacher-establishment because in any case countereducation - or reeducationproducing life and social environment in which they grow technologized youth is a force that
competes with the transmission of knowledge organized and sequenced regulated processes
of education. To enable that countereducation doesn’t interfere and, worse, be set against the
teaching process. They must take and integrate social instruments that are already being used
by young people. Audiovisual communication, multimedia and new possibilities and
constraints of the "network society" should be incorporated into the educational track that
leads to evolutionary changes in the methodology of education, teaching and learning for both
teachers and for students, because as we have seen in this project interactions with new media;
new methods and new situations arise causing unforeseen possibilities and unexpected
opportunities while students also learn to overcome difficulties.
The Web constitutes an innovative format for content delivery and information exchange.
That is one reason why knowledge and use of the Web would justify its inclusion within the
curriculum of a university that focuses on technology. “In addition, there are many skills
where our students will be developed, adapted, extended or even reinvented in the use of
technology as a professional key development through collaborative processes” as future
company managers.
2.2 Defining the concept of web 2.0
Taken together, these applications form the collaboration platform that social networking
applications and their variations, including mash-ups and blogs, rely on in order to
accomplish high levels of collaboration. In keeping with unbounded systems thinking, the
proliferation of the series of Web 2.0 applications and their growth are defined more by
communication patterns than adherence to taxonomies and architectures. This is one of the
factors that were taken into account in defining unbounded systems thinking as the method
of enquiry.

dynamics are defining social networking (O’Reilly, 2005. et.al.).
In order to teach these skills, the pedagogical bases that lay the foundations for the use of
the WWW within this project are:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Communicative Language Teaching (and learning). Students are collaborating in a
foreign language in a natural and spontaneous way, so language use is promoted by
theirs mere use.
Learner-centred pedagogy. The students themselves choose topics for interaction, as
well its pace and format, according to their personal interests.
Learning autonomy. The students are co-managers of their own learning process, and
therefore take full responsibility for the related training contents, instead of merely
digesting information in a passive manner.
Learning by doing (experiential learning). In order to be able to participate, students
must learn –in a practical way- how to get in the new medium and environment of
Internet and multimedia formats (image processing, audio and video, etc.).
Collaborative learning. Students find themselves totally integrated in a virtual learning
and exchange community. Interaction with peers is a basic requirement to advance in
the learning process.
Cultural exchange. Students experience first-hand direct contact with the cultural
systems, values and environment of their partners on the other side of the world.

networking in the next generation of services available on the Internet.

Table 1. An overview of Web 2.0 applications, illustrating the role of social networking in
the next generation of services available on the Internet.
2.3 Web 2.0 in learning and teaching
Samples of areas and approaches where MIT-UPV has had good effect has been:
Group work can often be aided by having social software available – this is no surprise
when we note that social software is software that facilitates group process. Thus, for
example: blogs can be used in personal writing and the group gives its opinion.
Social constructivism (Vygotsky , 1978) has, as a central precept, that knowledge is created
by learners in the context of and as a result of social interaction. Social constructivist
approaches are particularly aided by MIT-UPV as mediating mechanisms between
collaborating students and between students and teachers, particularly between students
who might sometimes be working in different places and at different times. Thus, for
example, a group of students might construct a device in a wiki, but also be guided by a
teacher who provides the fundamentals in the same wiki.
Constructionism, advocated by Seymour Papert, is particularly amenable to Web 2.0
approaches. In Papert’s words ‘Constructionism … shares constructivism's connotation of
learning as "building knowledge structures" irrespective of the circumstances of the learning. It
then adds the idea that this happens felicitously especially in a context where the learner is
consciously engaged in constructing a public entity, whether it is a sandcastle on the beach or a
theory of the universe” (Papert, 1991). Thus social software systems can be used for the
construction of public entities, for example, via a video presentation on a social media system,
a blog entry (for individual work) and a set of wiki pages (for individual and group work).
2.4 Changes in student population
Web 2.0 technologies are one of several digital technologies that are increasingly helping
change some characteristics of current and future students, and these changes may
necessitate profound changes in learning and teaching methods.

Social Networking and Science Research: The MIT-UPV and Metal 2.0 Cases

57

Marc Prensky (1978) defined ‘digital natives’ as a generation that has grown up with digital
technology, operating at “twitch speed”, and performing multiple activities simultaneously.
Thus Oblinger and Oblinger characterize the next generation (“n-gen”) students as digitally
literate, highly Internet familiar, connected via networkedmedia, used to immediate
responses, preferring experiential learning, highly social (“being a friend of a friend is
acceptable”), prefer to work in teams, craving interactivity in image rich environments (as
opposed to text intensive environments), and having a preference “for structure rather than
ambiguity”. Oblinger and Oblinger also point to a different kind of student, one who is nontraditional and working and studying at the same time.
Questions arise: Are these new student skill and preference sets different enough to demand
changes in teaching methods to successfully engage with them? Do the skill sets of incoming
students demand (possibly only transitional) ‘remedial’ teaching, for example, in using
libraries and finding primary sources? Is the changing student profile going to need different
ways of teaching that, e.g., minimise traditional patterns of attendance and increase flexibility
in where and when learning takes place? Somewhat anecdotally, there are different
perspectives relating to student engagement (and therefore grades and retention):
•

•

We have seen reports of lecturers moving part or all of their electronic course support
from traditional virtual learning environments to social networking systems like
MySpace and Facebook, because of greater student engagement with these kinds of
social networking tool. Web 2.0 enabled approaches may therefore help engage with
students. However, there is also evidence that many students see these as "their" space
that should not be ‘invaded’ by faculty (Hewitt, 2006).
On the other hand, recent student interviews in a UK university revealed that students
were not concerned how they are taught (e.g. through lectures, seminars, or through a
blended learning approach) as long as the instruction was good. This then raises the
question of what is good practice in learning and teaching in different modalities.

The emergence of a computational social science shares with other nascent interdisciplinary
fields (e.g., sustainability science) the need to develop a paradigm for training new scholars.
A key requirement for the emergence of an interdisciplinary area of study is the
development of complementary and synergistic explanations spanning different fields and
scales. Tenure committees and editorial boards need to understand and reward the effort to
publish across disciplines. Certainly, in the short run, computational social science needs to
be the work of teams of social and computer scientists. In the long run, the question will be:
should the academic world train computational social scientists, or teams of
computationally literate social scientists and socially literate computer scientists?
The emergence of cognitive science in the 1960s and 1970s offers a powerful model for the
development of a computational social science. Cognitive science emerged out of the power
of the computational metaphor of the human mind. It has involved fields ranging from
neurobiology to philosophy to computer science. It attracted the investment of substantial
resources to establish a common field, and it has created enormous progress for public good
in the last generation. We would argue that a computational social science has a similar
potential, and is worthy of similar investments.2

2.5 Possible issues and problems
An incomplete set of additional problems and issues that arise in relation to MIT-UPV are:
1. Many students work is about content sharing and repurposing. This can easily be seen
by students as part of a new teenage copy-and-paste culture that runs counter to
traditional notions of plagiarism, and adjustments may need to be made, either to
redefine plagiarism (unlikely to occur), or to help students transcend this culture in the
environments (more likely to occur).
2. There may be changes in teacher roles like the emphasis on active learning, with creation,
communication and participation playing key roles, and on changing roles for the teacher,
indeed, even a collapse of the distinction between teacher and student altogether.
3. There may be skills and/or culture crisis as traditional teachers are forced to use
unfamiliar tools and work in unfamiliar ways and alien environments.
4. There may be economic factors at work, particularly in a world of broad participation.
Not all students may be digitally connected (with a computer and Internet connection)
at home or in their halls. These students would be at a profound disadvantage in a new
teaching/learning concept world.
The MIT-UPV project was selected in 2010 by publisher Ian Lancashire through its
publication Language Learning and technology3, as one of the 20 world's most prestigious
on-line projects.
2.6 Conclusions
The project has two complementary facets, namely, the academic exchange at all levels, and
the development of an ideal university model from and for the students. Both of these
aspects could evolve in the near future in an independent, yet complementary, way. It is
also feasible, as has already been suggested earlier, to work co-operatively towards a deeper
understanding of both university systems, and even to take a step ahead towards a
university system which better meets the needs and expectations of our students. All this is
closely related to total quality management and improvement; a goal for both institutions.
MIT-UPV Exchange provides a nearly-ideal meeting point between teaching innovation and
the improvement of global quality within our university systems. Regarding the former
aspect (teaching and learning), the project has emerged as a contextualized application of
core Internet technology and the World Wide Web to learning and training, both in technical
and in international collaborative skills. Concerning the second component (quality), the
experience is a powerful tool to assess specific needs, suggestions and problems within the
university, always from the point of view of its main clients, the students.
The flexibility of the project makes it even possible to go one step ahead of web-based
exchanges and achieve a more direct and personal link between human beings (not only via
computers) in both universities.

3. Metal 2.0 research project: Presentation
The METAL 2.0 project is a project of collective learning, which lasted for four years;
initiated in 2008, where it has been tried to evaluate each one of the 2.0 Web tools and its

possible implantation in companies at individual and/or collective level from the
accumulated experience managing the infometal marketplace (www.infometal.com) which
has conceived for 6 years as one of the first enterprise social networks of the country.
The project is carried out in cooperation between Metal-Processing Technology Institute
(AIMME) and the EBIM (Electronic Business Information Management) Group of
investigation of the Polytechnic University of Valencia.
Unlike personal social networks (the users register then add their friends or relatives for
fun), or professional social networks (the users register, then they add their professional
contacts related to purchases/sales, cooperation, etc.), in enterprise social networks, the
users are the enterprise associations and they register their associates, and these associates
anonymously use the network for purchases/sales, finding out the positions of other
companies or extracting data that they may wish to use).
3.1 Uses of Web 2.0 in metal 2.0 project
Phase 1: 2008/2009
The EBIM group has identified three phases in the use of Web 2.0. These phases are: the
participation of the user, the generation of conversations in the digital environment and the
collaborative work. The passage from one stage to another depends on several factors which
they emphasize: the culture of use of 2.0 Web and later the degree of relation of the users in
the use that is being carried out (it is not the same to work in a common project as to answer
a post in a personal blog). The project METAL 2.0 is located within first stage of use of Web
2.0. Within this one it emphasizes with the result of hearing generation. Concretely the
potential of relation of Web 2.0 is being operated. Generating a win all environments by
taking advantage of the visibility that offers the digital surroundings and the facility to
establish relations through content can be gotten to establish work contracts since Internet is
talking back every better time the way in than the people we interacted.
3.2 Action, diffusion and results
After the day of presentation of the Project 'METAL 2.0: Social networks and Web 2.0 for
business enterprises, which was attended by a total of 60 companies; published the videos of
the same one in Internet with the purpose of forming free to the user companies of these
technologies, and asking for their support in the completion of the survey of the project.
These videos have been an awareness and a woken up of these companies with respect to
innovation. A 17,324 downloads in the first 5 months, visitors are from 44 countries, 38
universities, business schools and research centers. Data exceeded all expectations.
After the publication in Internet, the survey got more than 200 answers.
The initiative EXPERIMENT METAL 2.0, with 573 participating companies to date, aims at
encouraging ICT´s professionals of the companies that still do not use Web 2.0 to find out
about these technologies and their environments, to train purchasing and sales manager, so
that they begin to experience the use of social networks and make profitable use of its power
to obtain many contacts. This way, it would be possible to use their own social networks to
spread the ICT and to become familiar with these tools.
As far as the diffusion of the present results of the project, there are 141 references to it:
http://www.metal20.org/difusion/

60

Advanced Topics in Multimedia Research

As far as collaborators in the diffusion they appear a total of 36 companies and
organizations, with CENATIC and CEV as new features. We remind you that any
organization and/or company interested in helping in the diffusion can do it free by
following the steps indicated in: http://www.metal20.org/colaboradores/
Phase 2: 2010/2011 (Metal Project Crowdsourcing 2.0)
Conclusions of the Report:
Crowdsourcing as a concept is not totally new. It’s a word that brings together a
considerable number of initiatives that existed long ago, even before the adoption of the
term. However, its adoption has significantly facilitated to identify their common features,
which have allowed us to study and propose its basic features, critical success factors,
failure and environments where its use is advisable.
From the scientific point of view, crowdsourcing can be a dynamic process within
companies. By using the collective intelligence of knowledge as a heterogeneous set of users,
you can get novel solutions to various business problems, whether new or constantly
occurring. Different rewards are offered to users, which can range from financial rewards to
the recognition of their work that users will participate.
From a business standpoint, it is important to understand:
•
•

•

What is the logical scenario to implement a crowdsourcing initiative and also to
understand their advantages and disadvantages.
What are the steps that must be considered when launching an initiative like this:
• The company identifies and clearly defines the problem to be solved;
• It should raise the question and challenge the par4ticipants with the reward;
• Work with the participants to energize and clarify doubts or unclear aspects;
• The host provides ideas and proposals;
• The company (or the participants themselves) chooses ideas considered as winners;
• Rewarding the winner or winners;
• Transfer (if so agreed) to the company the rights to use the ideas.
What are the critical factors to take into account to make the initiative successful:
• Clearly define what is expected;
• Establish the proper reward, not just monetary;
• Management of the community and building on ideas,
• Selection process must be transparent and clear, ideally chosen by the group.

If you consider the main factors listed above and other factors which the company may
consider necessary, they may be linked to the collective intelligence of a group to solve
problems and innovate complex priority with a much greater diversity of opinion and
paying only for what is considered as success.
To conclude the report, highlighting the role of crowdsourcing as a good catalyst for the
innovation processes of companies, incorporating collective intelligence, open innovation and
collaborative spirit in the task is not easy to adopt nowadays. The pioneers, who open new
roads, will be those who are called to form this new partnership between all that lies ahead.
3.3 Conclusion
After analyzing the relationship between different environments, both corporate and
university/research, to generate uptake and retention of users (both present and future) and

Social Networking and Science Research: The MIT-UPV and Metal 2.0 Cases

61

ensure growth in the content generated by them, we note that for to uptake (and that
recruiting users is one of the most important crowdsourcing challenges) exist five major
solutions:
1.
2.
3.

4.
5.

We can require users to make contributions if we have authority to do so (for example,
a manager may require 100 employees to help build a company-wide system).
We can pay users. Mechanical Turk4 for example provides a way to pay users on the
web to help with a task.
We can ask for volunteers. This solution is free and easy to execute, and hence is most
popular. Most current CS systems on the Web (such as Wikipedia, YouTube) use this
solution. The downside of volunteering is that it is hard to predict how many users we
can recruit for a particular application.
The fourth solution is to make users pay for service. The basic idea is to require the
users of a system A to pay” for using A, by contributing to a CS system B. …..
The fifth solution is to piggyback on the user traces of a well-established system (such
as building a spelling correction system by exploiting user traces of a search engine).
This gives us a steady stream of users. But we must still solve the difficult challenge of
determining how the traces can be exploited for our purpose.

Once we have selected a recruitment strategy, we should consider how to further encourage
and retain users. Many encouragement and retention (E&R) schemes exist. We briefly
discuss the most popular ones. First, we can provide instant gratification, by immediately
showing a user how his or her contribution makes a difference. Second, we can provide an
enjoyable experience or a necessary service, such as game playing (while making a
contribution). Third, we can provide ways to establish, measure, and show fame/trust/
reputation. Fourth, we can set up competitions, such as showing top rated users. Finally, we
can provide ownership situations, where a user may feel he or she “owns” a part of the
system, and thus is compelled to “cultivate” that part. For example, zillow.com displays
houses and estimates their market prices. It provides a way for a house owner to claim his
or her house and provide the correct data (such as number of bedrooms), which in turn
helps improve the price estimation.
These E&R schemes apply naturally to volunteering, but can also work well for other
recruitment solutions. For example, after requiring a set of users to contribute, we can still
provide instant gratification, enjoyable experience, fame management, and so on, to
maximize user participation. Finally we note that deployed CS system often employ a
mixture of recruitment methods (such as bootstrapping with “requirement” or “paying”,
then switching to “volunteering” once the system is sufficiently “mature”).

4. Final conclusion
Many experts conclude that the crowdsourcing can be applied to a wide variety of
problems, and that it raises numerous interesting technical and social challenges. Given the
success of current CS systems, they expect that this emerging field will grow rapidly. In the
near future, they foresee three major directions: more generic platforms, more applications
and structure, and more users and complex contributions.
The Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) is a crowdsourcing Internet marketplace that enables
computer programmers (known as Requesters) to co-ordinate the use of human intelligence to perform
tasks that computers are unable to do yet.

62

Advanced Topics in Multimedia Research

First, the various systems built in the past decade have clearly demonstrated the value of
crowdsourcing. The race is now on to move beyond building individual systems, toward
building general CS platforms that can be used to develop such system quickly.
Second, they expect that crowdsourcing will be applied to ever more types of applications.
Many of these applications will be formal and structured in some sense, making it easier to
employ automatic techniques and to coordinate them with human users. In particular, a
large chunk of the Web is about data and services. Consequently, they expect
crowdsourcing to build structured database and structured services (Web services with
formalized input and output) will receive increasing attention.
Finally, They expect many techniques will be developed to engage and ever broader range
of users in crowdsourcing, and to enable them, especially naïve users, to make increasingly
complex contributions, such as creating software programs and building mashups (without
writing any code), and specifying complex structured data pieces ( without knowing any
structured query languages).
4.1 Final thoughts5
The networks have a life. They grow, change, reproduce, survive and die. A social network
is a kind of super human, with an anatomy and physiology of their own. Social networks
can develop a type of intelligence that increases or supplements individual intelligence.

1. Introduction
“Thangka”, is a transliteration of Tibetan which means painted scroll, an art of painting on
silk or cloth. It is primary components of painting art in the snow-capped plateau with clear
characteristics of Tibetan art, and has a long history, in the early 7th century when the Tubo
dynasty had emerged, Buddhism are introduced Tibet. Extant the earliest Thangka is 11th
century works, the most Thangka works are 17th century and 18th century, and all works
that stored generation before the 15th century with little. Its content interesting and colorful
stories, relate to religion, the history event, personage, local conditions and customs,
folklore, fairy story, building layout, astronomy calendar, Tibetan medicine, Tibetan
pharmacology and so on. It is extremely costful image data and historical material in
Tibetan Studies field, and regarded as an encyclopedia of the history and society of the
Tibetan ethnic group, having highly studying value and aesthetic value. The digital
protection of Thangka is a very meaningful work with rapid development in information
technology age. Thangka is the use of powder and drawn by the exquisite natural pigment
paintings, and Thangka image different from the natural landscape images and other
images due to its wide range of themes, the wide variety, different sorts, abstruse semantic,
plump picture, brilliant color. So its research relate to image processing, pattern recognition,
computer vision, artificial intelligence, etc.
Since 2002, our group relative research of Thangka image has been the State Ethnic Affairs
Commission of China, the National Natural Science Foundation of China, Gansu Province
Natural Science Foundation funding. So far, all aspects of research had made some progress,
there are also many issues to be studied in further. Our study aim in the cultural heritage of
Thangka is digital protection, main content include inpainting of Thangka image,
construction of resource repository and information retrieval of Thangka, some research
results will be introduced in this chapter.
The rest is organized as follows: Section 2 introduce restoration of Thangka image.
Construction of recourse repository of Thangka is expressed in section 3. Thangka
image annotation and retrieval semantic-based is introduced in section 4. In section 5,
content-based Thangka image retrieval is introduced. Finally, the conclusions are drawn in
section 6.

2. Restoration of Thangka image
2.1 Damaged Thangka and the meaning of digital restoration
Image inpainting is not only an important research topic in the fields of image restoration
but also a research hotspot in image processing and computer vision. It’s main application
include virtual restoration of cultural heritage and artwork, region filling, object removal
and so on [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. Thangka as a living culture and an important cultural heritage,
there are many treasures unique. But through the vicissitudes of life, some Thangka was
serious damaged and the task of save, collation and study arduous will be very formidable.
There is no doubt that improve the computer's processing capabilities in cultural heritage
and artwork has important academic value, wide application of social and cultural
development of great significance.
2.2 A digital restoration method for Thangka image
A new method is proposed for damaged image inpainting of Thangka image, which is
combining the shape of damaged patches and type of neighborhood patches, according to
the current algorithm characteristics of image inpainting, implementing automatic damaged
regions inpainting.
2.2.1 Shape classification of damaged patches
The first stage is segmentation and merger. The initial segmentation is to get the damaged
regions of image through watershed method [8], but it is prone to over-segmentation,
therefore the region merging is used.
Small regions merging:
Step 1. transform original image from RGB to LUV;
Step 2. compute the LUV mean value of initial segmentation regions;
Step 3. get each neighborhood of segmentation regions;
Step 4. merge the small regions with it adjacently in space and similar in color;
Step 5. update LUV mean value and neighborhood information of each small regions, up
till inexistence the small region of area less than threshold Ta;
Regions are merged to color close and space adjoins:
Step 1. compute the squared error of each small region with its neighborhood in LUV space;
Step 2. judge whether exist neighborhood patches that less than threshold Ts in the
squared error, if present, then current small will be merged to the area of the least
squared error, if not, do nothing;
Step 3. operate by repeated merging, until without the regions can be merged.
Through the above merger can restrain over-segmentation or less-segmentation effectively,
where area threshold Ta and squared error threshold Ts need to be repetitious adjusted.
The next stage is shape classification of damaged patches.
Obtain the damaged patches. A mask image can be obtained through the damaged region
segmentation, where each pixel is represent with 1 for damaged region and each pixel is
represent with 0 for non-damaged region. Assumptions the mask image of damaged region

Research Outline and Progress of Digital Protection on Thangka

segmented as showing in Fig 1, the algorithm to get the damaged patches by region growing
steps are:
Step 1. along the scanning line direction to scan the mask image, to initialize the mark of
damaged patches: sign = 2 ;
Step 2. Step 2. if the pixel value is 1,then the node add FIFO (First Input First Output), and
the node value is updated to sign = 2 ;
Step 3. Step 3. pop-up the first elements in the FIFO, make 4-neighbour or 8-neighbour
region growing, if the pixel value of neighborhood is 1,then add FIFO, and its value
is updated to sign , otherwise, do nothing, up till the FIFO is empty;
Step 4. Step 4. sign + + , repeat Step 2 and Step 3, until the scanning finish all pixels of the
whole image.
In order to prevent the confusion for damaged patches sign and damaged pixel mark,
initialize sign = 2 , all damaged patches sign will subtract 1 while find each damaged
patches, and made the first damaged patches mark 1, The second damaged patches mark 2,
and so on, the k damaged patches mark k. The pixel-set of pixel value 1 and 2 is mark of
damaged patches and its number respectively, Fig 2 is damaged patches mark of Fig 1.

Fig. 1. The mask image of damaged region

Fig. 2. Damaged patches mark of damaged patches
Shape classify to damaged patches. Studies show that the width or height of damaged
patches can be repaired is T on non-texture structure inpainting algorithms, its range
between 30 and 40. Moreover, texture structure inpainting algorithms can repair damaged
image in a larger scale. Linear classifier as formula (1):

70

Advanced Topics in Multimedia Research

f ( x ) = min( Mw , Mh ) − T

(1)

Where, min mean lesser, Mw and Mh denote width and height of the damaged patches,
T indicate the maximum width or height that can be inpainted damaged patches for the
method of non-texture structure; the damaged patches is linear while f ( x ) < 0 , and the
damaged patches is blocky while f ( x ) ≥ 0 .
2.2.2 Neighborhood classification of damaged patches
Image segmentation make whole image divided into mutually disjoint regions, texture
information of neighborhood must be obtained when neighborhood classification of
damaged patches. The situation of the neighborhood of damaged patches is roughly: (1) the
around of damaged patches is texture region; (2) the around of damaged patches is nontexture region; (3) the around of damaged patches is mixed region, that is, have both texture
region and non-texture region. Fig 3 is a schematic drawing that image segmented, where A,
B and C is neighborhood patches of damaged patches.

Fig. 3. Neighborhood patches
The algorithms of acquiring the neighborhood patches of damaged patches as following:
Step 1. get the outer-edge’s mark of damaged patches, outer-edge is non-damaged pixels
and inner-edge is damaged pixels;
Step 2. reject the iterative mark of edge, the remaining mark is the neighborhood’s number
of damaged patches;
Step 3. use the remaining mark as kernel points, adopt the method of region growing to get
the neighborhood patches of damaged patches.
The current image inpainting algorithms are divided into two primary categories: texture
and non-texture, therefore the neighborhood patches of damaged patches will be divided
into: texture patches and non-texture patches, so that selection corresponding algorithm to
repair a damaged image.
We use gray level co-occurrence matrix to extract two-order statistics information, and then
extract texture feature of image.
Gray level co-occurrence matrix:
For any given a 2D image f ( x , y ) , and gray level Ng , then the size of gray level cooccurrence matrix is Ng × Ng , each element of the matrix is defined by (2):

71

Research Outline and Progress of Digital Protection on Thangka

p( i , j ) =

#{[( x1 , y 1 ),( x2 , y 2 )] ∈ S| f ( x1 , y 1 ) = i , f ( x2 , y 2 ) = j}
#S

(2)

Where, # denote the frequency of pixel point that satisfies some condition; ( x1 , y1 ) and
( x2 , y 2 ) is space coordinate of pixel points, respectively; S expresses the set of pixel pair
that have something space relation; i and j indicate gray value of pixel.
Due to symmetry properties of gray level co-occurrence matrix, generally only need to
calculate in four direction: 00 , 450 , 900 and 1350 respectively, and make finally features that
have rotational invariance. Texture size is different for different texture image, also different
on gray level co-occurrence matrix, therefore the various statistics of gray level cooccurrence matrix as texture features. Those statistics are angular second-order moment,
contrast, relevance, entropy and inverse difference moment, respectively.
Angular second-order moment:
F1 =

F1 reflect the local uniformity of image, the bigger is the value, the more uniform is image

F5 is the reverse of contrast on gray level co-occurrence matrix, which measure the local
consistency of image. If an image is approach uniform, the inverse difference moment tend
to 1.

Calculate angular second-order moment, contrast, relevance, entropy and inverse difference
moment in four direction： 00 , 450 , 900 and 1350 , respectively, their expectation and
variance as final features.
The size and rang of texture features is different, they are called heterogeneous feature, and
need normalization process. Assuming there are M samples, features of each sample
expressed as: (uFi 1 , uFi 2 , uFi 3 , uFi 4 , uFi 5 ,σ Fi 1 ,σ Fi 2 , ,σ Fi 3 ,σ Fi 4 , σ Fi 5 ) , where 1 ≤ i ≤ M . Take one of
the feature components for example, our improved Gauss normalization as following:
Let uF 1 j , uF 2 j , … , uFMj indicate the j dimension feature components of M samples, uFj
and σ Fj denote expectation and variance respectively. The feature uFij can be normalized in
(0,1) by formula (8) which play role is identical for each component.

The following is classification method of damaged neighbourhood.
Main inpainting algorithm generally is classified into two categories: structure-based
inpainting and texture-based inpainting. The neighborhood patches of damaged patches are
divided into texture, non-texture and mixed in our study, so that farther to select different
algorithm to repair damaged patches according as they neighborhood patches. On the basis
of the feature extraction of neighborhood patches make neighborhood classification of
damaged patches, k-nearest neighborhood( KNN) method were taking place to classify
neighborhood patches.
The classification on neighborhood patches of damaged patches based on feature of
neighborhood patches. Suppose that there are M training samples, where, N1 belongs to
texture category ω1 , N2 belongs to non-texture category ω2 , and N1+N2 =M. Now an
unknown category sample X, X belongs to ω1 or belongs to ω2 ? k-nearest neighborhood
method is just to compute the distances between the X’s feature and M training sample’s
feature, and then sort the distances from small to big, to take the smaller K distances, and K
is odd number. Finally, according to the category labeled of the smaller K distances vote to
get the unknown sample’s category labels. The vote method is: if the number more belong
to ω1 in the K samples, then X belongs to ω1 , otherwise X belongs to ω2 . Where K = 9 ,
which is determined by following experiment.
There are 100 training samples, 50 non-texture images and 50 texture images, 40 test
samples include 20 non-texture images and 20 texture images. At first, extract feature of
training samples through the previous methods, and then calculate the recognition rat of
different K, at last, select an appropriate K. Table 1 is the results of experiment.
Table 1 shows: when K increasing, recognition rate is rising gradually, recognition rate have
reached plateau when K soared to 9. Therefore K=9 is better, this not only avoided a lot of

2.2.3 Restoration the damaged patches
Restoration method is founded on algorithm analysis, shape of damaged patches and
neighborhood type, at same time, the type of damaged patches is established through its
neighborhood. Combining shape of damaged patches, the type of neighborhood patches can
achieve algorithm’s automatic selection when restoration a damaged image.
The proceedings will begin with, to construct algorithms library for Thangka image. There
are four algorithms in algorithms library: design and implementation of algorithm 1
depending on the current exemplar-based image inpainting [7]; sampled-based texture
synthesis be called algorithm 2 by [9,10]; algorithm 3 be designmed by the Oliveira model
[6]; and algorithm 4 is finished by TV or CDD model [2,3].
Secondly, algorithms are automatic selected based on the shape and type of damaged
patches. The type of damaged patches based on the neighborhood are given in the form of
define.
Define 1. If the damaged patches have one neighborhood patches of non-feature, the type is
called damaged patches of homogeneous non-feature.
Define 2. If the damaged patches have more than one neighborhood patches of non-feature,
the type is called damaged patches of heterogeneity non-feature.
Define 3. If the damaged patches have more than one neighborhood patches of feature and
non-feature, the type is called damaged patches of mixed type.
Define 4. If the damaged patches have one neighborhood patches of feature, the type is
called damaged patches of homogeneous feature.
Define 5. If the damaged patches have more than one neighborhood patches of feature, the
type is called damaged patches of heterogeneity feature.
Fig.4 shows our research result to select inpainting algorithm according to damaged patches

are given in the form of flow graph in Fig.5.
Through damaged region segmentation to get damaged patches, the reaction process is as
follows when number of damaged patches is not equal to 0.
If the shape of damaged patches is linear, inpainting the damaged patches with Algorithm 1
when the neighborhood is heterogeneity feature or mixed type; inpainting the damaged
patches with Algorithm 2 when the neighborhood of damaged patches is heterogeneity nonfeature; inpainting the damaged patches with Algorithm 3 when the neighborhood is
homogeneous non-feature; inpainting the damaged patches with Algorithm 4 when the
neighborhood is heterogeneity non-feature.

Implemented the automatic selection of inpainting algorithms combining the
characteristics of different inpainting algorithms, the shape of damaged patches and the
type of neighborhood patches.

There are a lot of correlative repair problem to need solution in damaged Thangka image,
such as damaged region segmentation, obtaining damaged patches accurately, and effective
inpainting the damaged patches. Main challenges for 2-D image inpainting lie in three
aspects: domain complexity, image complexity and pattern complexity. Compared with all
other image inpainting problems, for example, removal of occlusions, inpainting of old
photographs, Thangka image’s inpainting will be more difficulty due to the complexity of
picture in the artwork domain. Furthermore, image segmentation of complex damaged and
appropriate to Thangka image inpainting algorithm.
3. Construction of recourse repository of Thangka
This part researches on image knowledge repository for Thangka image based on the high
level semantic about the attributes that describe the mains in the pictures. The attributes of
mains are the domain knowledge that uses to establish the repository exactly, such as mains’
name, headwear, appearance, complexion, mudra, talisman etc. Firstly, devise the
conceptual data model of describing the mains depending on the attributes, show with
relational schema of relational database. Secondly, build image libraries on the basis of the
kinds, in accordance with the relational schema, use the non-automatic way acquiring
knowledge, that is, devise a special knowledge editor to get knowledge, form various fact
base for the kinds of mains and obtain fact knowledge for the repository. Thirdly, select
some attributes that can typically distinguish mains depending on the characteristics of the
mains attributes as key attributes, adopt production rule knowledge representation method,
save the key attributes to be conditions and names of mains to be conclusions, form rule
knowledge for the repository. At last, connect facts and rules by the process of knowledge
query, combine forward reasoning control, and split strategies base in the light of the
attribute of headwear, shape hierarchical conditions for production rule depending on
execution sequence of key attributes for every strategy, take Structure Query Language of
relational database to finish the reasoning work, provide strategy and rules in the process of
reasoning and semantic introductions about the result image for users, construct Thangka
image knowledge repository.
3.1 Attribute database of Thangka image
Thangka are generally classified into five areas by the content of picture: all kinds of deities,
human figures, Gesar, science and technology (building layout, astronomy calendar, Tibetan
medicine, Tibet pharmacology), decorative pattern and so on. Take for case of religion,
according to the status and identity of the main in Tibetan Buddhism culture, they have
several kinds of them, including Buddha, Patriarch, Bodhisattva, Yidam, Buddha Mother,
Arhat, Dakini, Dharmapala, Genius God and so on. The attributes of mains are the domain
knowledge that uses to establish the repository exactly, such as main Buddha’s name,
headwear, appearance, complexion, mudra, talisman etc.
Fig 8a, 8b, 8c, 8d, 8e, 8f, 8g is Amitabha Pure Land, Songzan Ganbu, Jokhang, Gesar, The

Fundamental knowledge base. It is memory machine of factual knowledge and
regularity knowledge
Knowledge reasoning. Inference mechanism is a set program that is used to control and
coordination the knowledge base system, which derive the corresponding conclusion
according to the fact and date of external input which are date of integrated database
and fundamental knowledge base, by some inference strategy.
Interface of knowledge acquisition. Acquisition the domain knowledge from
knowledge source to create fundamental knowledge base include fact and rule, the
purpose of knowledge acquisition is to translate expert's domain knowledge for
representation and reasoning of computer.
User interface. It is interface to achieve information exchange of knowledge base and
outside.
Integrated database. it is working memory of knowledge base, which save with to be
solved issue related initial conditions, fact, date, the various intermediate conclusions in
reasoning process, objective conclusion etc.
Explanation mechanism. Its function is to provide rules and strategies in the process of
knowledge reasoning aimed at query condition of user.

The core parts of the knowledge repository are fundamental knowledge base and inference

4. Thangka image annotation and retrieval semantic-based
4.1 The meaning and tasks of Thangka image annotation
It is the need of semantic-based Thangka image retrieval to establish an artifact annotation
Thangka image database in a more object-oriented world. Thangka image annotation will be a
heavy task with different classification, different content, and a picture with a lot of objects.
4.2 The current annotation methods and annotation contents
Take for case of religion of the main in Tibetan Buddhism [13,14]:
1.

2.

A headdress feature expression approach which mainly used contour feature and color
feature are proposed. The average of spectral frequency represents contour feature. The
color moment of internal contour represents color feature. Meanwhile, we can
automatically annotate headdress concepts through computing variable quantity of
spectral frequency and analyzing color distribution of internal contour.
A gesture feature expression method including five fingers directions, palm direction,
relate position of gesture is presented. Because of the difficult features for segmenting
gestures of Thangka image. Then, the concepts of unknown gestures can be predicted
with nearest neighborhood method on the basis of training annotated gesture set.

4.3 Semantic retrieval framework of Thangka image
The process of semantic-based Thangka image retrieval includes five steps: (1) Identifying
ROI (region of interested) of Thangka image; (2) Extracting visual features of ROI; (3)
Training concepts classifier with concept dictionary and visual features; (4) Constructing CK relation net; (5) Obtaining the retrieval result through using CSM algorithm on the basis
of C-K relation net. This research focuses on step (4) and (5).
4.4 Construct C-K relation net
C-K relation net is a description to the membership degree of semantic keyword and
relativity between semantic keywords as shown in Fig. 13; the lines between ci (any

84

Advanced Topics in Multimedia Research

conception node) and k j (any keyword node) indicate the membership degree between
conceptions of keywords, the lines between k j node denote the relationship of keywords,
and the lines of same color indicate the keywords are correlative. The membership degree of
some keywords belonging to a concept can be computed by the method of combining the
Delphi method and fuzzy statistics, after artificial annotation to ensure the relativity between
keyword and keyword. For example, the keywords “wisdom”, “sword of wisdom” and
“enlightenment” belong to the concept “Sword”, and the membership degree which can be
computed by subsequent methods are 0.45,1 and 0.85 respectively. Moreover, the keyword
“wisdom” also belongs to concepts “Rosary”, “padma”, “Bow and Arrow”, and so on[15].

Fig. 13. C-K relation net
Suppose Ei , j is membership degree of the jth keyword to the ith concept, then Ei , j can be
calculated:
Ei , j =

ω1Di , j + ω2 Fi , j
ω1 + ω2

(9)

where Di , j indicate the membership degree of the ith keyword to the jth concept by the
Delphi method, Fi , j is the membership degree of the jth keyword to ith concept by fuzzy
statistics, ω1 and ω2 are weighing coefficient.
The Delphi method, named by an ancient Greece city Delphi, is an expert survey of
established procedure. Since 40s in 20th, it has been widely used in several fields such as
economic management, psychology, sociology and so on. The characteristic of the Delphi
method is concentrating the experience and advices of experts, to obtain the satisfying
results by constantly feedback and revises. Semantic keyword is a description to conception
in Thangka image, at the same time the membership degree of keyword to conception is
different, besides, the emphasis to understand concepts is also different in various painting

Research Outline and Progress of Digital Protection on Thangka

85

school. Therefore, we adopt the Delphi method to calculate membership degree between
semantic keyword and concept in this paper.
Supposed there are n domain experts, then mik, j ( k = 1, 2, n) indicate the membership
degree of jth keyword to ith concept for someone expert’s opinion. The average value of
the membership degree can be calculated by (10), where ak represents the weight of kth
expert.
n

mi , j =  ak mik, j
k =1

(10)

And , the deviation mik, j can be calculated by formula (11):
n

d =  ak mik, j − mi , j
k =1

(11)

To given error ε > 0 , if d ≤ ε , then mi , j as an approximate value of Di , j ; if d > ε , then
repeat the above process, until the precision is satisfied. Here ε = 0.19
By statistic of the frequency of every semantic keyword appearing in the concepts and the
method of membership functions mentioned above, we can calculate the membership
degree of the semantic keyword to the concept.
In Thangka images, some semantic keywords are exclusive word to describe a concept, so
the membership degree of the semantic keyword to the concept is high. On the other hand,
some semantic keywords (including the ones have similar semantic) appear in several
concepts, and then the membership degree of the semantic keyword to the concept is low.
Based on the above characteristics, we propose a membership function as following:
1

Fi , j =  1
x + β
 i, j

xi , j = 1
xi , j ≥ 1

(12)

Where xi , j is a frequency of the ith concept corresponding the jth keyword (include with
similarity semantic keywords) in all concepts, β is correction parameter. The membership
degree of jth keyword to ith concept decreases with the increasing of xi , j , despite the

1
satisfies this relationship, it does not reflect the
x
membership degree of keywords to concepts in quantity. Without correction parameter β ,
while xi , j = 2 , Fi , j = 0.5 indicates the description of membership degree of two keywords to
decreasing of inverse proportion function

ith concept, it is incorrect obviously. In this kind of situations, the membership degree
is comparatively high. Therefore, correction parameter β is introduced to make the degree
of membership function could more accurately reflect the degree of keywords to the
concepts.

4.5 CSM algorithm

The main idea of CSM algorithm is to utilize membership relation of semantic keywords
and concept, relativity of semantic keywords, to calculate the similarity. The procedures are
as follows:
Step 1. in descending order, rank the membership degree of the semantic keyword which
C k is corresponding to.
Step 2. search whether there are C k , j in other concepts or those have similar semantic to
C k , j in C-K relation net, if done, then ordinal execute, or else turn to Step 4.
Step 3. extract C k , j appear in other concepts and those keywords have similar semantic to
C k , j , then from high to low, rank the membership degree of the concepts which the
semantic keyword are corresponding to. Save the concepts to RC .
Step 4. determine whether the searching of semantic keyword corresponding to C k is over.
If done, then the arithmetic is over, or else turns to Step 2.

Where, C k represents the concept waiting to be retrieved, C k , j represents the jth keyword
corresponding to the kth concept, Ek , j represents specific degree that the jth keyword
subordinate to kth concept, and RC represents the set of similarity concepts which are
retrieved finally. On the basis of C-K relation net, applying CSM algorithm to measure the
similarity of concepts could meet the retrieval needs of customers better. Because this
algorithm leans on C-K relation net, thereby, the efficiency of CSM algorithm will be
influenced by the dilatation of C-K relation net.
4.6 Semantic-based retrieval

Semantic-based Thangka image retrieval was roughly classified into three layers in our
research: (1) it is similarities of visual features that receive most attention on visual layer; (2)
it towards coherence of key area’s concept on concept layer; (3) high level semantic retrieval
place more weight on similarities of concepts. The experiment show that different retrieval
layers can meet different users’ demand and outcome is satisfactory.
4.6.1 Thangka image retrieval based on the visual layer

Thangka image retrieval based on the headwear feature:
Headwear is an important characteristic in religion class portrait image, different headwear
represent different category and have different meaning. First, the headwear’s feature you
specify image was extracted; then to calculate the similar distances between specify image
and database images of the headwear feature one by one, ascending sort the similar
distances; finally, to get retrieval image by some algorithm. There are 236 images in
Thangka image database, the number are 53, 65, 118 for headwear as monk hat, bun, crown,
respectively. Use 20 Thangka images as test sample, where 5, 5, 10 images have monk hat,
bun, crown respectively. The precision and recall ratio for the top ten, the top thirty, the top
sixty, the top one hundred to see Table 2.

Table 2. Retrieval performance of headwear
Thangka image retrieval based on the feature of gesture:
As with the process of Thangka image retrieval based on the headwear feature, precision
and recall of the retrieval result based on the feature of gesture is 78.63% and 71.06%,
respectively. Retrieval based on the feature of gesture with better retrieval performance
compare with retrieval based on the headwear feature, duo to geometrical features of
gesture are relatively easy to match, but the similarity of headwear feature are calculated by
contour and color which appear contour similarity, similar color in many cases.
4.6.2 Thangka image retrieval based on the concept layer

Thangka image retrieval based on the concept of key region:
That is what is called Thangka image retrieval based on the concept of key region, first
identifying key regions and extraction corresponding feature you specify, where key regions
are the objects of this article mainly aim at the headwear and gesture, respectively. Different
objects or regions have different feature, automatic annotation the concept of key regions
you specify, and then obtain the final retrieval result with a concept. The flow shows in
Fig.15 as fol1owing.
Experiment result and analysis:
The result of this experiment was: if the concept of key region was correct estimated you
specify image, then all of images of inclusion the concept can be retrieval in image database,
that is, recall and precision is 100%; retrieval result, instead, will be irrelevant with you

specify image. In our experiment, there are 236 Thangka images in image database, test
images 36, where 32 images’ concept of key region was correct estimated, correct rate
88.89%. Therefore to improve the judging ability of key region’s concept is very important,
which need further study.
4.6.3 Thangka image retrieval based on C-K relation net

We employed 31 concepts, include 11 gesture and 20 musical instruments, 133 keywords.
Each concept is described by several relevant keywords. First of all, annotate the
interdependency of these 133 keywords by manual way, and construct K-K correlation
matrix (keywords correlation matrix), where 0 indicates irrelevant and 1 indicates
correlation. Because this part of experiment is pertain to natural language processing, thus,
we apply manual annotation instead of analyze statistics of corpus. Second, six Thangka
artists and six Tibetan teachers were invited to evaluate the membership degree that each
keyword belongs to its relevant concept. The membership degrees were divided into three
hierarchies, important, in general, and minor. The relevant weights of the three hierarchies
are 1, 0.6, and 0.3 respectively. Applying Delphi method to appraise the evaluation and
obtaining the final result of manual evaluation. And then, applying the degree of
membership function this paper proposed to count the strength that every keyword belongs
to other concepts based on K-K relation matrix. Composing manual evaluation and fuzzy
statistics, we set the weight parameters ω1 , ω2 to 5 and 3. Thangka images are a description
to religion culture. Thereby, their content of semantic object is standard preferably. The
fuzzy statistics calculate the membership degree through counting the number of concepts
which are described by semantic keywords. Based on the reason above, we give more
weight to the part of manual evaluation. Finally, we obtain the retrieval result with CSM
algorithm based on the C-K relation net, part of retrieval result as shown in Table 3.
In the semantic retrieval of natural image, the concept of normal semantic object is
minimum granularity, whereas the minimum granularity of Thangka image is the semantic
keywords which corresponding to semantic concept. And, the similarity between concepts
depends on the interdependency of semantic keywords. Based on this attitude, we proposed
a novel method apply on high-level semantic similarity retrieval of Thangka image. Firstly,
construct K-K correlation matrix by manual annotation, and composing Delphi method and
fuzzy statistics to built C-K relation net. Secondly, it is easy to accomplish similarity retrieval
between concepts in the C-K relation net with CSM algorithm. Experiments indicated that

89

Research Outline and Progress of Digital Protection on Thangka

the method can express the similarity relation between concepts accurately. However, this
method only can satisfied similarity retrieval of concepts which inside the C-K relation net,
and invalid for the retrieval of new concept.

5. Content-based Thangka image retrieval

The technology on content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is relatively mature, due to rich in
color, picture complexity for Thangka image, however, some method for natural images are
not always to suit Thangka image. A Thangka image retrieval system color-based and
shape-based are intruduction.
Firstly, this part systematically studies extraction technology of visual characters about
image’s low-rise. On the basis of that, the typical extraction methods of characteristics of
color and shape are respectively studied. Retrieval system for color-based and shapebased Thangka image are designed and realized. In addition, during the process of
extracting color characters, an improved method called local accumulative histogram
based on HSV is come up with combined with traditional local accumulative histogram
and Thangka image’s characteristics. Through many experiments, it shows that the color
features seem to be more important than the shape features and the improved method
called HSV-based local accumulative histogram is superior to traditional local
accumulative histogram. Secondly, according to separate characteristics of color and
shape, those two experimental retrieval systems are used to analyze the result Thangka
image retrieval system. Then a comprehensive color-based and shape-based experimental
retrieval system is designed and realized. After the experiment result analyzed, it is found
that with comprehensive kinds of characteristics the efficiency of retrieving will be
enhanced.

5.2 Main contents

The key technology of content-based Thangka image retrieval is image feature extraction,
this low-level vision features includes color, texture, shape and spatial relation etc. The
retrieval methods for color-based and shape-based Thangka image are designed and
realized. In addition, during the process of extracting color features, an improved method

called local accumulative histogram based on HSV is come up with combined with
traditional local accumulative histogram and Thangka image’s characteristics. And a
comprehensive color-based retrieval system and shape-based retrieval system are designed
and realized.

The retrieval performance of feature color-based is superior to feature shape-based, and
the retrieval performance of Color Moment-based is superior to other retrieval of color
features.
An improved method of HSV-based local accumulative histogram which through to
reasonably demarcate the HSV Color Space with second similarity measure is
proposed, the retrieval efficiency are improved.
To achieve the color and shape of the multi-feature integrated search. Fig.17 is an
interface of content-based Thangka image retrieval, to show the retrieval result by a

6. Conclusion

The study aim of Thangka image’s digital is cultural heritage protection, main content
include inpainting of damaged Thangka image, construction of resource repository and
information retrieval of Thangka. Although our research had made some progress in the
domain, there are also many issues to be studied in further, such as image segmentation of
damaged, inpainting methods, Thangka image annotation, how to obtain domain
knowledge by automatic and semi-automatic way in order to reduce the manual
involvement, and a practical system platform of integration inpainting, content-based and
semantic -based Thangka image retrieval, which can efficiently realize all kinds of query in
Thangka domain, will be further research contents.

1. Introduction
The concepts of distance learning are prevalent in developing countries for last few decades and
it is very much in vogue in developed countries [13], [17]. In the developing countries it started
like many other countries did with correspondence courses where printed learning materials
used to be despatched to the students at regular intervals and students were expected to read
the materials and answer questions. The basic philosophy was teachers would be physically
away from the students and have to conduct the teaching process from distance [15].
With the development of computer industry and internet networks during the last three
decades things have changed and global communication has reached an unprecedented height
[13]. With these developments immense scopes have come to the surface to impart learning in
a much more efficient and interactive way. Multimedia technology and internet networks have
changed the whole philosophy of learning and distance learning and provided us with the
opportunity for close interaction between teachers and learners with improved standard of
learning materials compared to what was existing only with the printed media. It has gone to
such an extent to create a virtual class room where teachers and students are scattered all over
the world. Although some of these facilities are expensive still the developed world is in a
position to take advantage of these facilities to impart much better distance-learning to
students residing in the developed countries. But for developing countries the story is different
as computerization and network connections are still very limited compared to the developed
world. In this chapter we focus our attention on defining the problems of using these
technologies for much more improved and extensive distance-learning and suggest how we
could possibly reach these vast majority of people from the developing countries with the
improved quality of distance-learning provided by multimedia and internet networks.
Section one gives an introduction of the area. Section two presents the advancements
developing countries are making to make use of mobile technologies. Section three presents
the issue of usage of mobile technology with advanced multimedia tools in distance
learning in developing countries. We put our concluding remarks in section four.

2. Analyses of works done
The open-universities which started functioning by late sixties and early seventies of last
century, reaching off-campus students delivering instruction through radio, television,

recorded audio-tapes and correspondence tutoring. Several universities particularly in
developing countries still use educational radio as the main instructional delivery tool [13].
With the extended application of information technologies (IT), the conventional education
system has crossed physical boundaries to reach the un-reached through a virtual education
system. In the distant mode of education, students get the opportunity for education
through self-learning methods with the use of technology-mediated techniques. Efforts are
being made to promote distance education in the remotest regions of developing countries
through institutional collaborations and adaptive use of collaborative learning systems [15].
Mobile learning refers to the use of mobile or wireless devices for the purpose of learning
while on the move. Typical examples of the devices used for mobile learning include cell
phones, smartphones, palmtops, and handheld computers; tablet PCs, laptops, and personal
media players can also fall within this scope [8]. The first generation of truly portable
information has been integrated with many functions in small, portable electronic devices
[14]. Recent innovations in program applications and social software using Web 2.0
technologies (e.g., blogs, wikis, Twitter, YouTube) or social networking sites (such as
Facebook and MySpace) have made mobile devices more dynamic and pervasive and also
promise more educational potential [12].
Initially, computers with multimedia facilities can be delivered to regional resource centers
and media rooms can be established in those centers to be used as multimedia labs. Running
those labs would necessitate involvement of two or three IT personnel in each centre. To
implement and ascertain the necessity, importance, effectiveness, demand and efficiency, an
initial questionnaire can be developed. Distributing periodical surveys among the learners
would reflect the effectiveness of the project for necessary fine-tuning. After complete
installation and operation of a few pilot tests in specific regions, the whole country can be
brought under a common network through these regional centers [15].
In developed economies, newer versions of technology are often used to upgrade older
versions, but in developing economies where still older versions of technology are often
prevalent (if they exist at all), the opportunities for leapfrogging over the successive
generations of technology to the most recent version are that much greater [2].
In the conventional view, (i.e. as seen by technology developers and donors), developing
countries passively adopt technology as standard products which have been developed in
industrialized countries and which can be usefully employed immediately. However,
successful use of IT requires much more than mere installation and application of
systematized knowledge. It also requires the application of implied knowledge regarding
the organization and management of the technology and its application to the contextual
environment in which it is to be used. This implied IT knowledge often represents
experience with the deployment of previous technology accumulated over time, such
experiences contributing towards the shaping of new technology [2].
In addition to purely technological issues, the development of appropriate human resources
skills are required, i.e. extensive training of the people who are going to use (and train
others how to use) the resources. Training is seen as particularly important as this is not
technology just a few people to benefit from, but for many. As Pekka Tarjanne, Secretary
General of the ITU, made clear at Africa Telecom '98, "communication is a basic human
right" (original emphasis). Nelson Mandela, at Telecom 95 in Geneva, urged regional cooperation in Africa, emphasizing the importance of a massive investment in education and

skills transfer, thereby ensuring that developing countries also have the opportunity to
participate in the information revolution and the "global communications marketplace"[2].
Canada's International Development Research Centre (IDRC) runs a number of developing
country projects that involve technology leapfrogging. The Pan Asian Network (PAN) was
set up to fund ICT infrastructure and research projects in developing countries across Asia.
Individuals, development institutions, and other organizations should all be able to use the
infrastructure so as to share information [2].
PAN works with Bangladesh's world famous grassroots Grameen Bank. One service here is
a "telecottage", where network services can be obtained. The technology and the material
will be tailored to meet the needs of Grameen's typically poorly educated clients. One of
PAN's objectives is gender equity. Women, who constitute some 95% of Grameen's
borrowers, will be prominent among PAN users in Bangladesh [2].
PAN is also responsible for linking Laos to the Internet. The Science, Technology and
Environment Organization (STENO) of the Laos Government invited some Laotian IT
professionals living and working overseas to return home and share their experiences with
their colleagues in the country. STENO collaborated with PAN in designing an 18-month long
project to build the necessary infrastructure for a dial-up e-mail service. Among the pioneer
users were "researchers working on agriculture and aquaculture projects; journalists managing
national news agencies and newspapers; lawyers consulting on international legal issues;
travel agents planning business trips; computer resellers tracking down suppliers and
obtaining pricing information; and about 20 others in both the public and private sectors" [11].

3. How to use mobile technology with advanced multimedia tools
In Section 2, we presented various efforts made to make distance learning effective in
developing countries. Presentation of course materials through multimedia in remote locations
where in villages there could be school structures where those presentations could be made is
feasible. Of course learning materials must be self-explanatory and not boring. Using
multimedia facilities like videos, audios, graphics and interesting textual descriptions, it is
possible to reach the remote locations of the world where computer technology has not
reached yet. As the areas not covered by computer and internet technology is still profoundly
vast in the world this approach seems to be very constructive and should be pursued.
Wherever possible distance learning through multimedia should be imparted through
internet as internet and networks are the vehicles of multimedia. But since bandwidth
connection is still very limited in vast areas of Asia, Africa and Latin America it would still
take long time to reach major part of the population of the above-mentioned regions with
multimedia and web.
Mobile technology offers a very hopeful way to reach the vast population of the developing
countries as it does not require bandwidth connections. We have to develop distance
learning using multimedia through mobile technology. This seems to be the most viable
way to reach billions living in the rural areas of the developing countries. Hence
considerable research efforts must be dedicated to this line. Instructions could be sent
through emails to mobiles of the distance learners. Also relevant website addresses could be
transmitted to their emails and they could then visit those sites of distance learning though
the internet of their mobiles.

Advanced Topics in Multimedia Research

In his book, Mayer (2001) declares that while learning from the text-only books results in the
poorest retention and transfer performance, learning from books that include both text and
illustrations and from computer-based environments that include on-screen text,
illustrations, animations and narrations results in better performance [9].
Similar to e-Learning, mobile technologies can also be interfaced with many other media
like audio, video, the Internet, and so forth. Mobile learning is more interactive, involves
more contact, communication and collaboration with people [20].
The increasing and ubiquitous use of mobile phones provides a viable avenue for initiating
contact and implementing interventions proactively. For instance, Short Message Service
(SMS) is highly cost-effective and very reliable method of communication. It is less
expensive to send an SMS than to mail a reminder through regular postal mail, or even
follow-up via a telephone call. Further, no costly machines are required (which is clearly the
case in terms of owning a personal computer).Besides SMS, distance learners can use mobile
phones/ MP3 players to listen to their course lectures, and for storage and data transfer.
New technologies especially mobile technologies are now challenging the traditional
concept of Distance Education [21]. Today the more and more rapid development of the ICT
contributes to the increasing abilities of the mobile devices (cell phones, smart phones,
PDAs, laptops) and wireless communications, which are the main parts of the mobile
learning. On the other hand for the implementation of mobile learning it is necessary to use
a corresponding system for the management of such type of education [4].
The use of mobile technologies can help today's educators to embrace a truly learner-centred
approach to learning. In various parts of the world mobile learning developments are taking
place at three levels:
•
•
•

The use of mobile devices in educational administration
Development of a series of 5-6 screen mobile learning academic supports for students
Development of a number of mobile learning course modules [5].

Research into the current state of play in Europe indicates:

There is a wide range of roles for mobile technologies supporting the learner in many
ways ranging from relatively simple use of SMS texting to the more advanced use of
smartphones for content delivery, project work, searching for information and assessment.
Some proponents of mobile learning believe that it will only ‘come of age’ when whole
courses can be studied, assessed and learners accredited through mobile devices.
Although books are now being downloaded onto mobile devices, the authors believe
that to support the learning process a great deal of thought has to be given to the
structure of the learning and assessment material. However, it is true that for some,
mainly at higher education level, mobile phones offer the opportunity to access
institutional learning management systems. This provides greater flexibility to the
learner without any new pedagogical input.
Costs are coming down rapidly; new first generation simple mobile phones will not be
available on the market from 2010. All mobile phone users in Europe will be using 3 or
4G phones within the next two years. A welcome associated step is a move towards
some form of standardization by the mobile phone companies as exemplified by the
shift to common charging devices over the next two years.
The value which is put on possession of a mobile phone, especially by young people is
surprising and the data on ownership suggests that this will be a ubiquitous tool for all

very shortly and that it will be well cared for: there is evidence that ownership of
devices brings responsible use and care.
Large scale educational usage in schools currently depends on government investment
but in higher and further education it is safe to assume that all learners will have their
own devices. Institutions will need to advise potential students on the range of devices
most suitable for the curriculum, as they do currently with regard to computers. The
convergence between small lap tops and handheld devices will continue until they are
regarded as different varieties of the same species of technology.
There is a great potential for educational providers to work with large phone
companies, both to reduce costs and to co-develop appropriate software [19].

Bangladesh Open University (BOU) is the only national institution in Bangladesh which is
catering distance education in the country. It has extensive network through out the country to
provide readily accessible contact points for its learners. After passing of 15 years since its
inception, BOU has lagged behind in using technologies. In consideration of its limit to
conventional method in teaching, a project was undertaken to test the effectiveness and viability
of interactive television (TV) and mobile’s Short Message Service (SMS) classroom and explore
the use of available and appropriate technologies to provide ICT enabled distance tuition. In
this project, the mobile technology’s SMS along with perceived live telecast was used to create
ideal classroom situation for distance learning through the Question Based Participation (QBP)
technique. The existing videos of BOU TV programs were made interactive using this
technologies and technique. The existing BOU TV program and interactive version of the same
were showed to same learners of BOU to evaluate its effectiveness. It is found from the study
that this interactive virtual classroom significantly perform well in teaching than BOU video
programs (non-interactive) which is used at present [1].
Another paper presents and discusses NKI (Norwegian Knowledge Institute) Distance
Education basic philosophies of distance teaching and learning and their consequences for
development of a learning environment supporting mobile distance learners.
For NKI it has been a major challenge to design solutions for users of mobile technology
who wish to study also when on the move. Thus, when students are mobile and wishing to
study, the equipment and technologies they use will be in addition to the equipment used at
home or at work. The solutions must be designed in ways to allow both users and non-users
of mobile technology to participate in the same course. This means that we have looked for
solutions that are optimal for distributing content and communication in courses,
independent on whether the students and tutors apply mobile technology or standard PC
and Internet connection for teaching or learning. The learning environment must efficiently
cater for both situations and both types of students. The solutions were developed for PDAs.
During the time of the development and research the technologies have developed rapidly.
Mobile phones are including PDA functionalities and vice versa. In principle the aim of
developments is to design solutions that can be used on any kind of mobile devices.
The paper builds on experiences from four European Union (EU) supported projects on mobile
learning: From e-learning to m-learning (2000-2003), Mobile learning – the next generation of
learning (2003-2005), Incorporating mobile learning into mainstream education (2005-2007) and
the ongoing project, The role of mobile learning in European education (2006-2008).
Most NKI courses are not designed to function as online interactive e-learning programs,
although some parts of the courses may imply such interaction with multi-media materials,
tests and assignments. The courses normally involve intensive study, mainly of text based

102

materials, solving problems, writing essays, submitting assignments and communicating
with fellow students by e-mail or in the web based conferences. This means that most of the
time the students will be offline when studying. From experience we also know that the
students often download content for reading offline and often also print out content for
reading on paper. All aspects and functions of mobile learning in the NKI large scale
distance learning system is clearly an additional service to the students [3].
Mobile Assisted Language Learning (MALL) describes an approach to language learning
that is assisted or enhanced through the use of a handheld mobile device. MALL is a subset
of both Mobile Learning (m-learning) and Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL).
MALL has evolved to support students’ language learning with the increased use of mobile
technologies such as mobile phones (cellphones), MP3 and MP4 players, PDAs and devices
such as the iPhone or iPAD. With MALL, students are able to access language learning
materials and to communicate with their teachers and peers at any time anywhere [10].

4. Current limitations of mobile technology and how to overcome these
4.1 Current limitations of mobile technology
Every technology has some limitations and weaknesses, and mobile devices are no exception.
They have shown some usability problems. Kukulska-Hulme summarized these problems as
follows: 1) physical attributes of mobile devices, such as small screen size, heavy weight,
inadequate memory, and short battery life; (2) content and software application limitations,
including a lack of built-in functions, the difficulty of adding applications, challenges in
learning how to work with a mobile device, and differences between applications and
circumstances of use; (3) network speed and reliability; and (4) physical environment issues
such as problems with using the device outdoors, excessive screen brightness, concerns about
personal security, possible radiation exposure from devices using radio frequencies, the need
for rain covers in rainy or humid conditions, and so on. It is important to consider these issues
when using mobile devices and designing the learning environment [7]. We expect mobile
producers would take care of these problems in the near future.
4.2 How to overcome these
However, looking at how rapidly new mobile products are improving, with advanced
functions and numerous applications and accessories available these days, the technical
limitations of mobile devices may be a temporary concern. Also, the use of mobile
technologies in education is moving from small-scale and short-term trials or pilots into
sustained and blended development projects [18].
The most serious issue faced by mobile learning is the lack of a solid theoretical framework
which can guide effective instructional design and evaluate the quality of programs that rely
significantly on mobile technologies. As Traxler pointed out, evaluation of mobile learning
is problematic because of its “noise” characteristic with “personal, contextual, and situated”
attributes (p. 10). Several attempts to conceptualize mobile learning have been made since
the emergence of mobile and wireless technologies [18]. Traxler provided six categories by
reviewing existing trials and pilot case studies in the public domain: 1) technology-driven
mobile learning, 2) miniature but portable e-learning, 3) connected classroom learning, 4)
informal, personalized, situated mobile learning, 5) mobile training/performance support,
and 6) remote/rural/development mobile learning [18].

Koole developed a framework for the rational analysis of mobile education (FRAME) model
which presents three aspects of mobile learning: the device, the learner, and the social
environment. This model also highlights the intersections of each aspect (device usability,
social technology, and interaction learning) and the primary intersection of the three aspects
(mobile learning process) in a Venn diagram. What makes this FRAME model useful are the
criteria and examples of each aspect and interaction and the checklist that might help
educators plan and design mobile learning environments [6].
The definitions, technological attributes, and existing frameworks of mobile learning
introduced above can help readers gain an understanding of mobile learning and how it is
relevant to the future of teaching and learning with mobile technologies. However, previous
studies and efforts suffer from the lack of a pedagogical framework. A number of the
applications of mobile technologies in learning have shown a few links to established
pedagogical theory. There is a need for the many different directions and unique
applications to be logically categorized within the context of distance education. In order to
better understand the current status of mobile learning and come up with comprehensive
design guidelines for its future use, it is necessary to categorize educational applications
with mobile technologies and position them in a logical framework. The transactional
distance theory provides a useful framework based on sound theoretical and pedagogical
foundations that can define the role of mobile learning in the context of distance education
[12]. But as we know with multimedia technologies it’s possible to combine more than one
media like text, graphics, audios, and videos together in preparing study materials which go
a long way in providing effective distance learning through mobile technologies.

5. Conclusion
In this chapter we studied the problems of imparting distance learning through multimedia in
developing countries. We suggested mobile technology a viable and affordable media through
which distance learning could be imparted to billions of people in an efficient way. We
presented some examples of achievements in this field in this chapter where we can use
telephone, photography, audio, video, internet, eBook, animations and so on in mobile and
deliver effective distance education in developing countries. In the developed countries the
majority of students already use their mobile devices to interact with and learn from the world
around them and a world class room is created. They engage their current situation with texts,
tweets, and Facebook updates to their friends. They yelp out for help finding a place to eat
dinner and report back their findings. Some even use Goggles to find information about their
surroundings from a picture. And they already do this in our class rooms [16]. But for
developing countries it would take a while to reach this stage. More research needs to be carried
out to tap the vast opportunity of reaching to billions in developing countries through mobile
technology and gearing up multimedia technologies to be easily transported to those locations.
