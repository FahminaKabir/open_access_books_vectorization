About the Book
Graphic Design and Print Production Fundamentals was created by the Graphic Communications Open Textbook
Collective. This creation is a part of the B.C. Open Textbook project.
The B.C. Open Textbook project began in 2012 with the goal of making post-secondary education in British Columbia
more accessible by reducing student cost through the use of openly licensed textbooks. The B.C. Open Textbook project
is administered by BCcampus and funded by the British Columbia Ministry of Advanced Education.
Open textbooks are open educational resources (OER); they are instructional resources created and shared in ways
so that more people have access to them. This is a different model than traditionally copyrighted materials. OER are
defined as teaching, learning, and research resources that reside in the public domain or have been released under an
intellectual property license that permits their free use and re-purposing by others (Hewlett Foundation).
Our open textbooks are openly licensed using a Creative Commons license, and are offered in various e-book formats
free of charge, or as printed books that are available at cost.

Introduction
Ken Jeffery

Figure I.1 Car graphics are an example of modern day print design

On any given day, you can look around your surroundings and come in contact with print design. Information comes to
you in many forms: the graphics on the front of a cereal box, or on the packaging in your cupboards; the information on
the billboards and bus shelter posters you pass on your way to work; the graphics on the outside of the cup that holds
your double latte; and the printed numbers on the dial of the speedometer in your car. Information is communicated by
the numbers on the buttons in an elevator; on the signage hanging in stores; or on the amusing graphics on the front of
your friend’s T-shirt. So many items in your life hold an image that is created to convey information. And all of these
things are designed by someone.

Figure I.2 Times Square has many examples of print design

Traditionally referred to as graphic design, communication design is the process by which messages and images are used
to convey information to a targeted audience. It is within this spectrum that this textbook will address the many steps
of creating and then producing physical, printed, or other imaged products that people interact with on a daily basis.

2 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

Design itself is only the first step. It is important when conceiving of a new design that the entire workflow through to
production is taken into consideration. And while most modern graphic design is created on computers, using design
software such as the Adobe suite of products, the ideas and concepts don’t stay on the computer. To create in-store
signage, for instance, the ideas need to be completed in the computer software, then progress to an imaging (traditionally
referred to as printing) process. This is a very wide-reaching and varied group of disciplines. By inviting a group of
select experts to author the chapters of this textbook, our goal is to specifically focus on different aspects of the design
process, from creation to production.
Each chapter begins with a list of Learning Objectives, and concludes with Exercises and a list of Suggested Readings on
the Summary page. Throughout, key terms are noted in bold and listed again in a Glossary at the end of the book.
In Chapter 1, we start with some history. By examining the history of design, we are able to be inspired by, and learn
from, those who have worked before us. Graphic design has a very rich and interesting heritage, with inspirations drawn
from schools and movements such as the Werkbund, Bauhaus, Dada, International Typographic Style (ITS), as well as
other influences still seen in the designs of today.

Figure I.3 Johannes Itten was a designer associated with the Bauhaus
school

We now work in an age where the computer has had an influence on the era of Post Modernism. Is this a new age? Are
we ushering in an era unseen before? Or are modern-day designs simply a retelling of the same tropes we have seen for
hundreds of years?
Chapter 2 follows with a discussion about the design process. Contrary to what we tend to see in popular television
shows and movies where advertising executives are struck with instant, usable, and bold ideas, design strategies are
seldom insights gained through such a sudden outburst of inspiration. The design process is a deliberate, constructive,
and prescriptive process that is guided by specific strategies. For example, before any piece of designed communication
can be started, some very detailed research needs to be performed. This happens well before any graphic design or layout
software is opened on a computer. Designing is a form of problem solving, where a system is created to communicate
a specific and targeted message. The design process is the way that a designer breaks the problem into discrete creative
activities. First is an exploration of what is trying to be achieved. Facts are gathered about the problem, and the problem
itself is often defined very specifically. The idea phase is where brainstorming and ideation occurs, often without

INTRODUCTION • 3

judgment, as a way to gather as many different ideas and directions as possible. From this, solutions are evaluated, both
for their perceived impact on the target audience and for their perceived effectiveness in portraying the desired message.
Finally, all of this information is distilled into an accepted solution. Designers do not sit around waiting for ideas to just
happen; they follow a process in order to make it happen.

Figure I.4 The golden ratio is a constant that appears in nature

Chapter 3 presents the most important and necessary design elements required for effective graphic layout and design.
When designing a layout, the designer cannot just ‘throw’ all of the information onto the page. Design is a thoughtful
process that makes use of many different skills to create a design that is both appealing and legible. We discuss the grid
in its many forms, including different types of grid such as the ITS grid, the golden ratio, and even strategies for using
no grid at all. Space is an important design element, with different items on the page requiring more or less area to be
effective. We also talk about the density, or ‘colour’ of type on the page, along with a number of different typographical
conventions for making the most of the collection of words on the layout.
In Chapter 4, we begin to move along in the production process and discuss some of the more physical attributes of
design. And one of the most important topics in creating printed products is that of colour. It is a complex part of the
design process, affecting how an image is transmitted to the eye, how the colours are perceived, and what makes one
thing look different from another, even if it is the same colour. Have you ever printed something on your home printer
only to be disappointed that it doesn’t look like it did on your computer screen? Highly detailed systems of colour
management are put in place to mitigate these differences.
As we proceed toward creating printed output, Chapter 5 is where it all starts to come together. In the print process, this
stage is called prepress. Prepress is where all the design work is translated from a file on the computer in front of you
into a form that can be ‘printed’ onto a given surface. Imagine the requirements for creating not just one copy of a design,
but thousands! This is a very important step, and if mistakes or production hurdles are not discovered and overcome
at this step, then the project can end up being very costly for all parties involved, from the designer, to the printer, to
the client. This chapter deals with topics such as preflight, imposition, separations, platemaking, and considerations for
other print and finishing processes.
Chapter 6 is a comprehensive look at how all of this design work will result in a finished product. The many ways that
a design can be printed are varied and complex, but having some knowledge about how the print process works will
help to create a more successful project. Is it going to be printed on a box, or on a billboard? How many copies are
needed: one or one million? These and many more decisions influence how a product will be produced. This chapter
outlines some of the more popular printing technologies, along with industry standard procedures for working with
them. Suggestions for choosing the right paper (or other types of substrates) are also made along with best practices for
working with colour on the printed page.

4 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

Chapter 7 rounds out this textbook with a look at online technologies and how they affect, and are affected by, the
printed word. We examine online web-to-print solutions and their contribution to bridging the process from graphic
design to printed work. We also highlight other considerations such as branding and digital file resolution strategies. As
the world has moved into an Internet-connected, always-on compendium of information, print remains a vital, relevant,
and important part of the media mix. Effective communication campaigns make the most of all opportunities that media
design and, in particular, print design can offer.
The goal of this text is to bridge the disciplines of communication design and print production to form a concise,
accessible compendium outlining the design process in this modern, computer-driven age. While it is common, or
perhaps easy, to surmise that graphic design is solely a computer-driven pursuit, when we take a step back, and look at
the entire process, we see that computer-aided design is only one part of a larger picture. And by including this larger
domain in our studies, we can truly gain an appreciation for the influences and strategies needed to be successful in this
field.

Industrial Revolution Overview
The Craftsman
Before the Industrial Revolution (1760-1840 in Britain) most aspects of design and all aspects of production were
commonly united in the person of the craftsman. The tailor, mason, cobbler, potter, brewer, and any other kind of
craftsman integrated their personal design aesthetic into each stage of product development. In print, this meant that
the printer designed the fonts, the page size, and the layout of the book or broadsheet; the printer chose (even at times
made) the paper and ran the press and bindery. Unity of design was implicit.
Typography in this pre-industrial era was predominantly used for books and broadsheets. The visual flavour of the fonts
was based on the historic styles of western cultural tradition — roman, black letter, italic, and grotesque fonts were the
mainstay of the industry. Typography was naturally small scale — needed only for sheets and pages — and was only large
when it was chiseled into buildings and monuments.
Technological Shift
The Industrial Revolution radically changed the structure of society, socially and economically, by moving vast numbers

1.1 INTRODUCTION • 7

of the population from agrarian-based subsistence living to cities where manufacturing anchored and dominated
employment and wealth. Agrarian-based society was tied to an aristocracy overseeing the land and controlling and
directing production through the use of human labour. In contrast, urban production, though still very much in need
of human labour (female and child labour in particular was in huge demand), was dominated by the mechanized
production of goods, directed and controlled by industrialists instead of the aristocracy. The factories were powered
initially by steam, and eventually by gasoline and electricity. These new manufacturing models were dominated by
an engineering mentality that valued optimization of mechanical processes for high yields and introduced a
compartmentalized approach to production.
Design and Production Separate
The design process was separated from the production-based process for a number of reasons. Primary was the
efficiency-oriented mindset of the manufacturers who were focused on creating products with low unit costs and high
yield outcomes, rather than on pleasing aesthetics or high-quality materials. Design process is time consuming and was
considered unnecessary for each production stage of manufactured goods.
Manufactured products were intended for the working and middle classes, and high-quality output was not a goal.
These products were never intended to vie for the attention of the upper classes — enticing them away from the services
and bespoke products of the craftsman (a contemporary example is Tip Top Tailors attracting Savile Row customers).
Rather, they supplied common people with goods they had not been able to afford before. This efficient line of thinking
created the still existing equation of minimal design plus low material integrity equalling low-cost products.
Design, rather than being a part of each step of production (implicit in the craftsman’s approach), was added for form
development and when a product needed more appeal for the masses — usually during the later stages of production
through decorative additions. Design was now directed by the parameters and constraints of the manufacturing process
and its needs.
Advertising Emerges
Despite low product standards, the high quantities and low costs of manufactured goods “stimulated a mass market and
even greater demand” (Meggs & Purvis, 2011, p. 127). The historic role of graphic design for broadsheets and books
expanded at this point to include advertising. Each company and product needed exposure to sell these manufactured
products to the mass market — no earlier method of promotion could communicate to this number of people.
The design aesthetic of these times was relatively untouched by stylistic cohesion or design philosophy. Industrialists
used a pastiche of historic styles that aspired to make their products look more upscale, but did not go as far as to create
a new visual language. This was a strategy that made sense and has since been repeated (consider early computer design
aesthetics). Usually, when a new medium or communication strategy is developed (advertising in print and the posters of
the Industrial Revolution), it uses visual and language styles that people are already familiar with, and introduces a new
way to deliver the message. Too much change alienates, but novelty of delivery works by adding a twist on the shoulders
of an already familiar form.
Font Explosion
In addition to its new role in promoting products to the mass market, graphic design moved forward with an explosion
of new font designs as well as new production methods. The design of fonts had earlier been linked to the pragmatic
and cultural objectives of producing books and broadsheets. With large format posters and numerous other print
components, text needed to do much more than represent a phonetic symbol. Innovations in production affected —
perhaps infected — printers with the pioneer spirit of the times, and all products and their potential were examined and

8 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

re-evaluated. This attitude naturally included the function and design of fonts and the methods used to reproduce them.
Text was often the only material used to promote its subject and became integral to a visual communication. Jobbing
printers who used either letterpress or lithographic presses pushed the boundaries of both, competing with each other
by introducing innovations and, in turn, pushing artists and type foundries to create more products they could use. An
entirely new font category, slab serif — sometimes called Egyptian — was created. Thousands of new fonts emerged to
meet the demand of the marketplace.
Photography
In addition to font development, the Industrial Age also contributed the photograph and ultimately its use in books
and advertising. Photography (for print design) was originally used as a research tool in developing engravings, but
this was costly and time consuming. Numerous inventors searched for ways to integrate photography into the press
process since the early years of its development in the 1830s. Photo engraving eventually arrived in 1871 using
negatives and plates. From that time forward, photography has been used to conceptually and contextually support the
communication of graphic design in its many forms.

1.2 William Morris and the Arts & Crafts Movement
Alex Hass

Conditions and Products of the Industrial Age
The Arts & Crafts movement emerged in the second half of the 19th century in reaction to the social, moral, and
aesthetic chaos created by the Industrial Revolution. William Morris was its founder and leader. He abhorred the cheap
and cheerful products of manufacturing, the terrible working and living conditions of the poor, and the lack of guiding
moral principles of the times. Morris “called for a fitness of purpose, truth to the nature of the materials and methods
of production, and individual expression by both artist and worker” (Meggs & Purvis, 2011, p. 160). These philosophical
points are still pivotal to the expression of design style and practice to this day. Design styles from the Arts & Crafts
movement and on have emphasized, in varying degrees, either fitness of purpose and material integrity, or individual
expression and the need for visual subjectivity. Morris based his philosophy on the writings of John Ruskin, a critic of
the Industrial Age, and a man who felt that society should work toward promoting the happiness and well-being of every
one of its members, by creating a union of art and labour in the service of society. Ruskin admired the medieval Gothic
style for these qualities, as well as the Italian aesthetic of medieval art because of its direct and uncomplicated depiction
of nature.
Many artists, architects, and designers were attracted to Ruskin’s philosophy and began to integrate components of them
into their work. Morris, influenced by his upbringing in an agrarian countryside, was profoundly moved by Ruskin’s
stance on fusing work and creativity, and became determined to find a way to make it a reality for society. This path
became his life’s work.
Pre-Raphealite Brotherhood
Morris met Edward Burne-Jones at Exeter College when both were studying there. They both read extensively the
medieval history, chronicles, and poetry available to them and wrote every day. Morris published his first volume of
poetry when he was 24, and continued to write and publish for the rest of his life. After graduation, Morris and BurneJones tried a few occupations, and eventually decided to become artists. Both became followers of Dante Gabriel Rossetti
who founded the Pre-Raphealite brotherhood that was based on many of Ruskin’s principles. Morris did not last long as
a painter, eventually finding his design vocation while creating a home for himself and his new wife (Rosetti’s muse and
model).
Discovering the lack of design integrity in Victorian home furnishings and various additional deficiencies in other
aspects of home products, he chose to not only design his home, but all its furniture, tapestries, and stained glass.
Morris & Co.
In 1860, Morris established an interior design firm with friends based on the knowledge and experiences he had in
crafting and building his home. He began transforming not only the look of home interiors but also the design studio. He
brought together craftsmen of all kinds under the umbrella of his studio and began to implement Ruskin’s philosophy
of combining art and craft. In Morris’s case, this was focused on making beautiful objects for the home. The craftsmen
were encouraged to study principles of art and design, not just production, so they could reintegrate design principles

9

10 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

into the production of their products. The objects they created were made and designed with an integrity a craftsman
could feel proud of and find joy in creating, while the eventual owner would consider these products on par with
works of art (an existing example is the Morris chair). The look of the work coming out of the Morris studio was
based specifically on an English medieval aesthetic that the British public could connect to. The English look and
its integrity of production made Morris’s work very successful and sought after. His organizational innovations and
principled approach gained attention with craftsmen and artisans, and became a model for a number of craft guilds and
art societies, which eventually changed the British design landscape.
William Morris and the Kelmscott Press
Morris’s interest in writing never waned and made him acutely aware of how the book publishing industry had been
negatively affected by industrialization. One of his many pursuits included the revitalization of the book form and
its design components through the establishment of the Kelmscott Press. The press was created in 1888 after Morris,
inspired by a lecture about medieval manuscripts and incunabula publications, began the design of his first font, Golden,
which was based on the Venetian roman face created originally by Nicolas Jenson.
In his reinterpretation of this earlier font, Morris strove to optimize readability while retaining aesthetic integrity —
in the process reviving interest in font design of earlier periods. Morris used this font in his first book, The Story
of Glittering Plain, which he illustrated, printed, and bound at his press. The design approach of this publication and
all others Kelmscott produced in its eight years was based on recreating the integrated approach and beauty of the
incunabula books and manuscripts of the medieval period. All aspects of the publication were considered and carefully
determined to create a cohesive whole. The press itself used hand-operated machinery, the paper was handmade, and
the illustrations, fonts, and page design were all created and unified by the same person to make the book a cohesive,
beautiful object of design. Morris did not wholly reject mechanization, however, as he recognized the advantages of
mechanical process. He considered, redesigned, and improved all aspects of design and production to increase physical
and aesthetic quality.
Kelmscott Press produced over 18,000 volumes in the eight years of its existence and inspired a revival of book design
on two continents. In addition, Morris inspired a reinterpretation of design and design practice with his steadfast
commitment to Ruskin’s principles. Future generations of designers held to Morris’s goals of material integrity —
striving for beautiful utilitarian object design and carefully considered functionality.

1.3 Deutscher Werkbund
Alex Hass

In the early years of the 20th century, the German Hermann Muthesius returned to Germany from England with
Morris’s Arts & Crafts concepts. Muthesius published the The English House in 1905, a book wholly devoted to the
positive outcomes of the English Arts & Crafts movement. Muthesius was a sometime cultural ambassador, possibly
an industrial spy, for Germany in England. His interest in the Arts & Crafts movement was not based on returning
German culture to the romantic values of an earlier pre-manufacturing era. He was focused on infusing the machinemade products of Germany with high-quality design and material integrity. Muthesius believed manufacturing was
here to stay. He was one of the original members of the state-sponsored Deutscher Werkbund — an association that
promoted the union of art and technology. The Werkbund integrated traditional crafts and industrial mass-production
techniques, and put Germany on a competitive footing with England and the United States. Its motto “Vom Sofakissen
zum Städtebau” (from sofa cushions to city-building) reveals its range.
Design Embraces the Manufacturing Process
Peter Behrens and Henry van de Velde were also part of the original leadership, and with Muthesius developed
the philosophy of Gesamtkultur — a cohesive cultural vision where design was the driving force of a wholly fresh,
man-made environment. Every aspect of the culture and its products was examined and redefined for maximum use
of mechanization in its production. The new visual language of Gesamtkultur was a style stripped of ornament in
favour of simplicity and function. All areas of cultural production were affected by this new philosophy — graphic
design, architecture, industrial design, textiles, and so forth — and all were reconfigured and optimized. Sans serif
fonts dominated the reductive graphic design style as did standardization of sizes and forms in architecture and
industrial design. Optimization of materials and mechanical processes affected every area. Germany embraced this new
philosophy and visual style for its simplicity and exactness. In 1919, Walter Gropius, a modernist architect whose work
was inspired by Werkbund ideals, was finally successful in opening a school he called the Bauhaus (in Weimar where
artists, industrialists, and technicians would develop their products in collaboration). These products would then build
a new future for German exports by virtue of their high level of functional utility and beauty.

11

1.4 Bauhaus
Alex Hass

The Bauhaus philosophy has become famous for its integrated approach to design education; “it precipitated a
revolution in art education whose influence is still felt today” (Whitford, 1995, p. 10). Most art colleges and universities
still base much of their foundational curriculum on its fundamental ideas.
The Bauhaus school was founded with the idea of creating a ‘total’ work of art in which all arts, including architecture,
would eventually be brought together. The first iteration of the school brought together instructors from all over Europe
working within the latest art and design styles, manufacturing ideologies, and technologies. An example of this new
teaching style can be found in its first-year curriculum. This foundation year exposed all students to the basic elements
and principles of design and colour theory, and experimented with a range of materials and processes. This allowed
every student the scope to create projects within any discipline rather than focus solely on a specialty. This approach to
design education became a common feature of architectural and design schools in many countries.
In addition to its influence on art and design education, the Bauhaus style was to become a profound influence upon
subsequent developments and practices in art, architecture, graphic design, interior design, industrial design, and
typography.
The school itself had three iterations in its 14-year run. With each iteration, the core concepts and romantic ideals were
modified and watered down to work within the realities of the difficult Nazi culture. When the school was finally closed
by its own leadership under pressure from the Nazi-led government, most of the faculty left the country to teach in less
difficult circumstances and continued to spread Bauhaus precepts all over the world. Many of its artists and intellectuals
fled to the United States. Because the Bauhaus approach was so innovative and invigorating, the institutions that were
exposed to the Bauhaus methodology embraced its principles. This is why the Bauhaus had a major impact on art and
architecture trends in Western Europe, the United States, and Canada.
Later evaluation of the Bauhaus design philosophy was critical of its bias against the organic markings of a human
element, an acknowledgment of “… the dated, unattractive aspects of the Bauhaus as a projection of utopia marked
by mechanistic views of human nature” (Schjeldahl, 2009, para. 6). And as Ernst Kállai proposed in the magazine Die
Weltbühne in 1930, “Home hygiene without home atmosphere” (as cited in Bergdoll & Dickerman, 2009, p. 41).
The very machine-oriented and unadorned aesthetic of the Bauhaus refined and evolved, eventually informing the clean,
idealistic, and rigorous design approach of the International Typographic Style.

12

1.5 Dada
Alex Hass

Dada does not mean anything. We read in the papers that the Negroes of the Kroo race call the tail of the
sacred cow: dada. A cube, and a mother, in certain regions of Italy, are called: Dada. The word for a hobbyhorse, a children’s nurse, a double affirmative in Russian and Rumanian, is also: Dada. (Tzara, 1992)
– Tristan Tzara, Dada Manifesto
Dada was an artistic and literary movement that began in 1916 in Zurich, Switzerland. It arose as a reaction to World
War I, and the nationalism and rationalism, which many thought had brought war about. Influenced by ideas and
innovations from several early avant-gardes — Cubism, Futurism, Constructivism, and Expressionism — its influence
in the arts was incredibly diverse, ranging from performance art to poetry, sculpture, and painting, to photography and
photographic and painterly collage.
Dada’s aesthetic, marked by its mockery of materialistic and nationalistic attitudes, became a powerful inspiration for
artists and designers in many cities, including Berlin, Paris, and New York, all of which generated their own groups.
The movement radically changed typographic ideals and created fresh approaches to text. Unburdened of its rules and
conventions, type was allowed to become expressive and subjective. The poetic output of the group was fresh and
different, and needed its typography to be as expressive and innovative as its content. Dada, in combination with aspects
of Constructivist and Suprematist typography, balanced the cultural discipline created and applied to typography by
other streams of contemporary design like the Bauhaus. This movement in particular advanced typography as a medium
of its own. It promoted the use of typography as an art material that could be manipulated by artists and designers
expressively and without preordained rules and structural principles.
Words emerge, shoulders of words, legs, arms, hands of words. Au, oi, uh. One shouldn’t let too many words
out. A line of poetry is a chance to get rid of all the filth that clings to this accursed language, as if put there
by stockbrokers’ hands, hands worn smooth by coins. I want the word where it ends and begins. Dada is the
heart of words. (Ball, 1996)
– Hugo Ball’s manifesto, read at Zunfthaus zur Waag on July 14, 1916

1.6 International Typographic Style
Alex Hass

International Typographic Style (ITS), also known as the Swiss Style, emerged in Switzerland and Germany in the 1950s.
ITS became known for design that emphasized objective clarity through the use of compositional grids and sans serif
typography as the primary design material (or element).
Guiding Principles
ITS was built on the shoulders of the ‘less is more’ ideal of the German Werkbund and the Bauhaus school. But its
pioneers pursued ideologies that had much more depth and subtlety. Ernst Keller, whose work in design spanned over
four decades, brought an approach to problem solving that was unique. His contribution to design was in defining the
problem. For Keller, the solution to a design problem rested in its content. Content-driven design is now a standard
practice. Max Bill, another pioneer, brought a purist approach to design that he had been developing since the 1930s.
He was instrumental in forming Germany’s Ulm School of Design, famous for its ITS approach. The school introduced
Greek rhetorical devices to amplify concept generation and produce greater conceptual work, while the study of
semiotics (creating and understanding symbols and the study of sending and receiving visual messages) allowed its
design students to understand the parameters of communication in a more scientific and studied way. At this time,
there was also a greater interest in visual complexity. Max Huber, a designer known for his excellent manipulation
of presses and inks, layered intense colours and composed chaotic compositions while maintaining harmony through
the use of complex grids that structured and unified the elements. He was one of many designers who began using
grids in strategic ways. ITS design is now known for its use of anchored elements within a mathematical grid. A
grid is the “most legible and harmonious means for structuring information” (Meggs & Purvis, 2011, p. 355). Visual
composition changed in many ways due to the grid. Design was already moving toward asymmetrical compositions,
but now even the design of text blocks changed — from justified text to aligned flush left, ragged right. Fonts chosen
for the text changed from serif fonts to sans serif, a type style believed to “express the spirit of a more progressive age”
by early designers in the movement. Sans-serif typefaces like Helvetica, Univers, and Akzidenz Grotesk were favoured
because they reflected the ideals of a progressive culture more than traditional serif fonts like Times or Garamond. ITS
balanced the stabilizing visual qualities of cleanliness, readability, and objectivity with the dynamic use of negative space,
asymmetrical composition, and full background photography.
Photography
ITS did not use illustrations and drawings because of their inherent subjectivity. Photography was preferred because of
its objective qualities, and was heavily used to balance and organically complement the typography and its structured
organizational grid. Often the photograph sat in the background with the type designed to sit within it; the two
composed to strengthen each other to create a cohesive whole. ITS refined the presentation of information to allow the
content to be understood clearly and cleanly, without persuading influences of any kind. A strong focus on order and
clarity was desirable as design was seen to be a “socially useful and important activity … the designers define their roles
not as artists but as objective conduits for spreading important information between components of society” (Meggs &
Purvis, 2011, p. 355).
Josef Müller-Brockmann, another one of its pioneers, “sought an absolute and universal form of graphic expression

14

1.6 INTERNATIONAL TYPOGRAPHIC STYLE • 15

through objective and impersonal presentation, communicating to the audience without the interference of the
designer’s subjective feelings or propagandistic techniques of persuasion” (Schneider, 2011). Mϋller-Brockmann’s
posters and design works feature large photographs as objective symbols meant to convey his ideas in particularly clear
and powerful ways.
After World War II, international trade began to increase and relations between countries grew steadily stronger.
Typography and design were crucial to helping these relationships progress — multiple languages had to be factored
into a design. While clarity, objectivity, region-less glyphs, and symbols were essential to communication between
international partners, ITS found its niche in this communicative climate and expanded beyond Switzerland, to
America.
ITS is still very popular and commonly used for its clarity and functionality. However, there is a fine line between
clean and simple, and simply boring. As the style became universal, its visual language became less innovative and was
perceived to be too restrictive. Designers wanted the freedom to be expressive, and the culture itself was moving from
cultural idealism to celebratory consumerism. ITS can be a very successful design strategy to adopt if there is a strong
concept binding all of the design components together, or when there is a vast amount of complexity in the content and
a visual hierarchy is needed to calm the design to make it accessible.

1.7 Late Modern | New York Style
Alex Hass

Late Modernism encompasses the period from the end of World War II to the early 21st century. Late Modernism
describes a movement that arose from and reacted to trends in ITS and Modernism. The Late Modern period was
dominated by American innovations spurred on by America’s new-found wealth. The need for more advertising,
marketing, and packaging was matched by a new mood in the culture — a mood that was exuberant and playful, not
rigid and rule-oriented.
Late Modern was inspired by European avant-garde immigrants. These immigrants found work in design and quickly
introduced Americans to early modern principles of an idealistic and theoretical nature. American design at this
point had been pragmatic, intuitive, and organic in composition. The fusion of these two methodologies in a highly
competitive and creative climate produced design work that was original in concept, witty, and provocative and, as
personal expression was highly prized, full of a variety of visual styles. Paul Rand is one of the great innovators of
this style. Rand was adept at using ITS when its rules and principles were called for, but he was also very influenced
by European art movements of the times. In his work, he fused the two and made works that were accessible, simple,
engaging, and witty. His work was inspirational, but his writing and teaching were as important, if not more, to
redefining the practice of design. He restructured the design department at Yale and published books on design practice
informed by ITS principles, softened by wit, and espoused the value of the organic look of handmade marks. As a result,
artists and designers began to merge organic shapes with simple geometry.
The look of graphic design also changed through advancements in photography, typesetting, and printing techniques.
Designers felt confident in exploring and experimenting with the new technologies as they were well supported by the
expertise of the print industry. Designers began to cut up type and images and compose directly on mechanical boards,
which were then photographed and manipulated on the press for colour experimentation. As well, illustration was once
again prized. Conceptual typography also became a popular form of expression.
Push Pin Studios
An excellent example of this expansive style can be found in the design output of New York’s Push Pin Studios. Formed
by Milton Glaser and Seymour Chwast, Push Pin was a studio that created innovative typographic solutions — I♥NY—
brand identities, political posters, books, and albums (such Bob Dylan’s album Dylan). It was adept at using and mixing
illustration, photography, collage, and typography for unexpected and innovative visual results that were always fresh
and interesting as well as for its excellent conceptual solutions. The influence of Push Pin and Late Modern is still alive
and has recently experienced a resurgence. Many young designers have adopted this style because of its fresh colours,
fine wit, and spontaneous compositions.

16

1.8 Post Modern
Alex Hass

By the early 1970s, the idealistic principles of Modernism were fading and felt flat and lifeless. Pluralism was again
emerging as people craved variety as a reaction to the reductivist qualities that modernism espoused.
Punk
In the late 1970s in Britain, Australia, and parts of the United States, a youthful rebellious culture of anger and distain
arose against the establishment. In many ways, the design language of Punk echoed the Dadaist style, though Punk was
anchored with a pointed, political message against the tyranny of society and the disenfranchisement of youth. A use
of aggressive collages, colours, and experimental photography were its hallmarks. These free-form, spontaneous design
works incorporated pithy tag lines and seethed with anger in a way that Dada work never attempted to achieve. Punk
actively moved away from the conformities of design, and was anti-patriotic and anti-establishment. Punk established
the do-it-yourself (DIY) ethos and stylized it with the angry anti-establishment mood of the mid 1970s, a time of
political and social turbulence. DIY style was considered shocking and uncontrolled. However, the influence on design
has been far reaching and subsequently widely emulated.
Jamie Reid, a pioneer of the Punk style, developed the visual signature look for the Sex Pistols and many other punk
bands. His personal signature style was known for a collaged ‘ransom note’ typography that became a typographic style
of its own. Reid cut letters out of newspapers and magazines, and collaged them together to be photographed. By doing
this, he could see what he was creating as he went along, trying out different font styles and sizes and seeing the results
instantly. Treating type as if it were a photograph also freed him from the restrictions of typesetting within a structured
grid and allowed him to develop his ideas and concepts as he created. This unguided, process-free approach to design
became a part of the Post Modern experimentation that was to come.
When Punk first exploded in the 1970s, it was deemed a youthful rebellion. In actuality, it was one of the many forms
of visual expression that manifested as part of the Postmodernist movement that began as a reaction to the rigid
restrictions of Modernism.
Early Post Modernism
Early Swiss Post Modern design was driven by the experimentations and teachings of Wolfgang Weingart who taught
at the Basel School of design in Basel, Switzerland. Weingart was taught ITS by the masters of the style, Emil Ruder
and Armin Hofmann at the Basel School. But once he became an instructor there, he questioned the “value of the
absolute cleanliness and order” (Meggs & Purvis, 2011, p. 465) of the style. He experimented vigorously with breaking
all typographic and organizational rules to see what the effect on the audience would be. He invigorated typography
with energy and in turn changed the viewer’s response to the visual information. Instead of a simple fast reading, the
reader now faced dynamic complexity free of any rules or hierarchies. The viewer was now compelled to spend more
time with a design piece to understand its message and parse the meaning of its symbolism.
One of his American students, April Greiman, brought this new design language back to California with her and heavily
influenced the youth culture there. David Carson, a self-taught designer working in the surf magazine world, took the

17

18 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

ideas of the style and adopted them to his own typographic experiments in the surfing magazines he designed. For
Carson, Post Modern design reflected the free spirit of the surf community.
Post Modernism is actually an umbrella term for many visual styles that came about after the 1980s. They are unified by
their reaction to Modernism’s guiding principles — particularly that of objectivity. A key feature of Post Modern design
is the subjective bias and individual style of the designers that practise it. Additional defining stylistic characteristics
can be summarized in the idea of ‘de-construction.’ The style often incorporates many different typefaces breaking
every traditional rule of hierarchy and composition. Visual organization becomes more varied and complicated with the
use of layers and overlapping. The use of image appropriation and culture jamming is a key feature. Dramatic layouts
that do not conform to traditional compositions are another common characteristic. A traditional grid is not used to
organize the layout of the elements, making composition look ‘free-style.’ Other organizational systems for the elements
developed — axial, dilatational, modular, and transitional systems created a fresh way to organize the information. The
combination of multiple geometric shapes layered with photographs created depth that worked well on the computer
monitor — now a component of contemporary society.
Post Modernism is still in use today, though selectively. The chaos created by our technological advancements needs
to be balanced with the ease of accessing information. The Apple brand is a good example of a contemporary design
approach that feels fresh and current, while delivering massive amounts of information in a clean and simple way. The
Post Modern methods of built-in visual difficulty are less welcome in our data-saturated culture.

1.9 Summary
Alex Hass

The technological revolution of the 1990s brought the mobile phone and computer to every home and office and
changed the structure of our current society much as manufacturing in the 1800s changed Britain and the Western
world. As with the Industrial Revolution, the change in technology over the last 20 years has affected us environmentally,
socially, and economically. Manufacturing has slowly been moved offshore and replaced with technology-based
companies. Data has replaced material as the substance we must understand and use effectively and efficiently. The
technological development sectors have also begun to dominate employment and wealth sectors and overtake
manufacturing’s dominance. These changes are ongoing and fast-paced. The design community has responded in many
novel ways, but usually its response is anchored by a look and strategy that reduce ornament and overt style while
focusing on clean lines and concise messaging. The role of design today is often as a way-finder to help people keep
abreast of changes, and to provide instruction. Designers are once again relying on established, historic styles and
methods like ITS to connect to audiences because the message is being delivered in a complex visual system. Once the
technological shifts we are experiencing settle down, and design is no longer adapting to new forms of delivery, it will
begin to develop original and unique design approaches that complement and speak to the new urban landscape.

COMMUNICATION DESIGN AND THE DESIGN PROCESS
The practice of graphic or communication design is founded on crafting visual communications between clients and
their audience. The communication must carry a specific message to a specific audience on behalf of the client, and do
so effectively — usually within the container of a concept that creates context and builds interest for the project in the
viewer.
See an illustrated model of the design process at http://www.dubberly.com/concept-maps/creative-process.html
Overview of the Design Process
The process of developing effective design is complex. It begins with research and the definition of project goals.
Defining goals allows you to home in on precisely what to communicate and who the audience is. You can then
appropriately craft the message you are trying to communicate to them. Additional information regarding how to
deliver your message and why it’s necessary are also clarified in the research stage. Often the preferred medium becomes
clear (i.e., web, social media, print, or advertising) as does the action you want your audience to take. Asking a millennial
to donate to a cause is a good example. Research reveals that transparency of donation use, donor recognition, and
ease of making the donation are vital to successfully engaging a millennial audience (Grossnickle, Feldmann, White, &
Parkevich, 2010). Research also reveals that millennials resist negative advertising, so the message must be crafted in
positive terms that are anchored to a realistic environment (Tanyel, Stuart, & Griffin, 2013). Knowing this information
before the concept development begins is vital to crafting a message that will generate the response your client needs.
Critiquing and analysis allow you to evaluate the effectiveness of the design approach as it develops through the stages
of an iterative process.

22

2.1 INTRODUCTION • 23

In order to design visual materials that communicate effectively, designers must understand and work with the syntax
of visual language. Meaning is expressed not only through content but through form as well, and will include both
intellectual and emotional messages in varying degrees.
Developing Concepts into Design Solutions
Designers are responsible for the development of the creative concepts that express the message. A concept is an idea
that supports and reinforces communication of key messages by presenting them in interesting, unique, and memorable
ways on both intellectual and emotional levels. A good concept provides a framework for design decisions at every stage
of development and for every design piece in a brand or ad campaign. An early example of this is the witty and playful
‘think small’ Volkswagen Beetle (VW) advertising campaign of the 1960s. By amplifying the smallness of its car in a ‘big’
car culture, VW was able to create a unique niche in the car market and a strong bond between the VW bug and its
audience (see Figure 2.1).

Figure 2.1 Volkswagen Beetle

When you implement solutions, you put concepts into a form that communicates effectively and appropriately. In
communication design, form should follow and support function. This means that what you are saying determines how
you say it and in turn how it is delivered to your audience. Design is an iterative process that builds the content and
its details through critiquing the work as it develops. Critiquing regularly keeps the project on point creatively and
compositionally. Critiquing and analysis allow you to evaluate the effectiveness of the whole design in relation to the
concept and problem. The number of iterations depends on the skill of the designer in developing the content and
composition as well as properly evaluating its components in critique. In addition, all of this must occur in the context
of understanding the technologies of design and production.
As you begin to build and realize your concepts by developing the content, the elements, and the layouts, you must
apply compositional and organizational principles that make sense for the content and support the core concept.
Compositional principles are based on psychological principles that describe how human beings process visual
information. Designers apply these principles in order to transmit meaning effectively. For example, research has shown
that some kinds of visual elements attract our attention more than others; a designer can apply this knowledge to
emphasize certain parts of a layout and give a certain element or message importance. These principles apply to all forms
of visual materials, digital media, and print.
When dealing with text, issues of legibility and readability are critical. Designers organize information through the use
of formal structures and typographic conventions to make it easier for the viewer to absorb and understand content.
The viewer may not consciously see the underlying structures, but will respond positively to the calm clarity good
organization brings to the text.

2.2 Design Research and Concept Generation
Alex Hass

Defining Design Problem Parameters
Many designers define communication design as a problem-solving process. (The problem/opportunity is how to
deliver information effectively to the desired audience.) The process that takes the designer from the initial stages of
identifying a communication problem to the final stage of solving it covers a lot of ground, and different models can be
used to describe it. Some are very complicated, and some are simple. The following sections break the design problemsolving process into four steps: (1) define, (2) research, (3) develop concepts, and (4) implement solutions.

25

2.3 Define
Alex Hass

Step 1: Define the Communication Problem
The inventor Charles Kettering is famously quoted as saying “a problem well-stated is half-solved.”
Clearly the first step in any design activity is to define the communication problem properly. To do this, you will need
to meet with clients to establish initial goals and objectives.
Here are some of the questions you should ask:
• What is the business of the client; what products or services does the client offer?
• What are the client’s long-term business goals? (What does the client want its business to have accomplished
in 5 or 10 years?)
• What is the purpose of the project? What does the client hope to achieve with it? (The goals of a specific
project are usually narrower than overall long-term business goals, but should fit within the larger picture.)
• What are the performance criteria that will be used to evaluate whether project goals are met?
• Who is the target audience?
• What is the client’s message to this audience?
• How does this project fit in with existing corporate materials?
• Does this piece require more than one format or medium?
• What corporate guidelines (if any) must be adhered to?
• Are illustration, photography, or any other special services required?
• Are there any special or unusual considerations around this project?
• What quantity is needed (for print)?
• What distribution method will be used (for print)?
• What is the budget?
• Who will approve the project? Will that person be available for sign-off when required?
Good planning at the beginning can make a project run smoothly and without surprises. Don’t assume anything;
both the designer and the client should listen closely to each other and ask plenty of questions. Keep in regular
communication, document discussions, and ensure that you have written confirmation of decisions.

26

2.4 Research
Alex Hass

Step 2: Conduct Research
Gather and analyze information What else do you need to know? The information you collected in the first stage is
just a starting point — now you need to do more research in order to fine-tune your goals and process. Check every
assumption, ask more questions, and add detail.
Research practices may involve:
• Competitor analysis: analyzing the competition to see what they do and determine their strengths and
weaknesses
• Ethnographic research: observing user behaviour and culture

• Site research: observing and understanding the strengths and weaknesses of a space to optimize the
effectiveness of the design experience you will be creating; site research is necessary to any design project
that is situated in a built environment
• Marketing research: analyzing behaviour in terms of consumer practices, including demographic profiling
(grouping people based on variables such as age/income/ethnicity/location to create profiles generally
describing their thinking/behaviour)
• User testing: measuring the ability of the product or service to satisfy users’ needs
• Co-creation: inviting end-users to brainstorm solutions with the design team before the concept phase of
design begins

Incorporating Research into the Design Process
Research should be a part of all design process, but what kind of research is done, and who does it, will be determined
by the scope and budget of the project. Some information may be publicly available, for example, through corporate
publications or previously published marketing studies or market data, but a design company may need to partner with
a research firm in order to do targeted in-depth research.
At the very least, design research should include:
• A literature review (gathering and reviewing all existing material that is relevant to your subject)
• Collected details (existing materials, corporate guidelines) of your client’s business and the services the client
offers
• Information on the target audience (What do they want? need? expect?)

• Analysis of competitors (Who are they? how are they different? how are they the same? how do they advertise
or make information available?)
• Estimates and technical advice from subcontractors (e.g., printers)

27

28 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

Some things to consider:
• Is a full design audit required? Much like a SWOT analysis, which assesses strengths, weaknesses,
opportunities, and threats, a design audit applies the same stringent methodology to analyzing your
competitors’ visual presence in the marketplace.
A graphic design audit is a fantastic and relatively easy way to get a clear picture of how your competitors are
perceived, what key messages they are communicating and how you look when placed alongside them. It’s
also a valuable exercise that informs you about the type of communication your customers are receiving on
a regular basis from your key competitors. (Clare, 2006)
• What are the implications of the audience profile in relationship to the project goals?
• What is the most appropriate means to communicate with this audience (i.e., what media and marketing tools
should you use)?
• How do the goals of this project fit into your client’s long-term goals?
• Is your client’s message what actually needs to be communicated in order to further the client’s business
goals?
Research takes time and can cost money, but in the larger picture will save time and money by helping to focus the
direction of the design process. It also helps you provide justification for your proposed communication solutions to
your client. Remember that all research must be carefully documented and raw sources saved and made available for
future reference.
Now that you have gathered all the information, it’s time to craft the design problem into a well-defined, succinct
statement.
A Problem Well-stated is Half-solved
The writer Mark Levy, in his article A Problem Well-stated is Half-solved, developed six steps you can take to state a
design problem so its solutions become clearer:
1. State the problem in a sentence. A single sentence forces you to extract the main problem from a
potentially complex situation. An example of a problem statement: “We need to increase revenue by 25%.”
2. Make the problem statement into a question. Turning the problem statement into a question opens the
mind to possibilities: “How do we increase revenue by 25%?”
3. Restate the question in five ways. If you spin the question from a variety of perspectives, you’ll construct
new questions that may provide intriguing answers.
For instance, try asking: “How could we increase revenue by 25% in a month?” “How could we increase it by
25% in an hour?” “How could we increase it by 25% in a minute?” “What could we stop doing that might cause
a 25% revenue increase?” “What ways can we use our existing customer base to affect the increase?”
4. Give yourself thinking quotas. An arbitrary production quota gives you a better shot at coming up with
something usable, because it keeps you thinking longer and with greater concentration.
When I asked you to “Restate the question five ways,” that was an example of an arbitrary quota. There’s
nothing magical about five restatements. In fact, five is low. Ten, or even a hundred, would be far better.

2.4 RESEARCH • 29

5. Knock your questions. Whatever questions you’ve asked, assume they’re wrong-headed, or that you haven’t
taken them far enough.
You might ask, “Why do we need an 25% increase at all? Why not a 5% increase? A 500% increase? A 5,000%
increase? What other things in the business might need to change that would be as important as revenue?”
6. Decide upon your new problem-solving question. Based on the thinking you’ve already done, this step may
not even be necessary. Often, when you look at your situation from enough angles, solutions pop up without
much more effort.
However, if you still need to pick a single question that summarizes your problem, and none seems perfect,
force yourself to choose one that’s at least serviceable. Going forward is better than standing still.
Now you can start brainstorming.
Concept Mapping
A good way to begin the process of research and problem definition is to write down everything that you already
know about your subject. This brainstorming can be done in a linear way by developing lists, or in a non-linear way,
popular with designers, called concept mapping. Concept mapping is a non-linear approach that allows a designer to see
what is known and what still needs to be researched. Concept mapping is also used to generate concepts and to create
associations and themes.
W5 + 1
The first step is to take a sheet of paper and write a central title or topic in the centre. Then surround this central idea
with information gathered by answering the following questions, based on the 5 Ws (who, what, where, why, and when),
plus one more, how:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

What are you trying to communicate? (the problem)
Why must communication occur? (what is its purpose?)
Who is the target audience?
Where will communication take place? (in what medium and location?)
When will communication take place?
How will you implement the concept?
What if? (what would be ideal?)

Once you’ve added all the information you have at hand, you will see any assumptions and gaps in that information, and
you can begin specific directed research to create a larger, more objective picture.
Here is an example of a concept map (See Figure 2.2). To see a concept map that details the scope of visual
communication, visit https://rossfitzy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/final-visual-comm-map.jpg
You can use the information in a concept map to generate other themes and concepts for your project. For example,
in the concept map above, you could develop another theme by highlighting in yellow all information from the 1970s.
This would reveal the parameters of design practice in the 70s and would additionally reveal what has been added and
changed in design practice since.

2.5 Develop Concepts
Alex Hass

Step 3: Developing Concepts
Concept development is a process of developing ideas to solve specified design problems. The concepts are developed
in phases, from formless idea to precise message in an appropriate form with supportive visuals and content. Once you
have done your research and understand exactly what you want to achieve and why, you are ready to start working
on the actual design. Ideally, you are trying to develop a concept that provides solutions for the design problem,
communicates effectively on multiple levels, is unique (different and exciting), and stands out from the materials
produced by your client’s competitors.
Generate, test, and refine ideas
A good design process is a long process. Designers spend a great deal of time coming up with ideas; editing, revising,
and refining them; and then evaluating their results every time they try something. Good design means assessing every
concept for effectiveness.
The design process looks roughly like this:
•
•
•
•

Generating a concept
Refining ideas through visual exploration
Preparing rough layouts detailing design direction(s)
Setting preliminary specifications for typography and graphic elements such as photography, illustration,
charts or graphs, icons, or symbols
• Presenting design brief and rough layouts for client consideration
• Refining design and comprehensive layouts, if required
• Getting client approval of layouts and text before the next phase
Developing Effective Concepts
A concept is not a message. A concept is an idea that contextualizes a message in interesting, unique, and memorable
ways through both form and design content.
A good concept reinforces strategy and brand positioning. It helps to communicate the benefits of the offer and helps
with differentiation from the competition. It must be appropriate for the audience, facilitating communication and
motivating that audience to take action.
A good concept provides a foundation for making visual design decisions. For example, Nike’s basic message, expressed
by its tagline, is “Just Do It.” The creative concept Nike has used since 1988 has been adapted visually in many ways, but
always stays true to the core message by using images of individuals choosing to take action.
“It was a simple thing,” Wieden recalls in a 2009 Adweek video interview in which he discusses the effort’s

31

32 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

genesis. Simplicity is really the secret of all “big ideas,” and by extension, great slogans. They must be
concisely memorable, yet also suggest something more than their literal meanings. Rather than just putting
product notions in people’s minds, they must be malleable and open to interpretation, allowing people of all
kinds to adapt them as they see fit, and by doing so, establish a personal connection to the brand (Gianatasio,
2013).
A good concept is creative, but it also must be appropriate. The creativity that helps develop effective, appropriate
concepts is what differentiates a designer from a production artist. Very few concepts are up to that standard — but
that’s what you should always be aiming for.
In 1898, Elias St. Elmo Lewis came up with acronym AIDA for the stages you need to get consumers through in order
for them to make a purchase. Modern marketing theory is now more sophisticated, but the acronym also works well to
describe what a design needs to do in order to communicate and get people to act.
In order to communicate effectively and motivate your audience, you need to:
A — attract their attention. Your design must attract the attention of your audience. If it doesn’t, your message is not
connecting and fulfilling its communication intent. Both the concept and the form must stand out.
I — hold their interest. Your design must hold the audience’s interest long enough so they can completely absorb the
whole communication.
D — create a desire. Your design must make the audience want the product, service, or information.
A — motivate them to take action. Your design must compel the audience to do something related to the product,
service, or information.
Your concept works if it makes your audience respond in the above ways.
Generating Ideas and Concepts from Concept Mapping
You can use the information in a concept map to generate additional concepts for your project by reorganizing
it. The concept tree method below comes from the mind-mapping software blog (Frey,
2008) http://mindmappingsoftwareblog.com/concept-tree/
1. Position your design problem as the central idea of your mind map.
2. Place circles containing your initial concepts for solving the problem around the central topic.
3. Brainstorm related but non-specific concepts, and add them as subtopics for these ideas. All related
concepts are relevant. At this stage, every possible concept is valuable and should not be judged.
4. Generate related ideas for each concept you brainstormed in step 3 and add them as subtopics.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you run out of ideas.
Applying Rhetorical Devices to Concept Mapping
After you have placed all your ideas in the concept map, you can add additional layering to help you refine and explore
them further. For example, you can use rhetorical devices to add context to the concepts and make them come alive.
Rhetoric is the study of effective communication through the use and art of persuasion. Design uses many forms of
rhetoric — particularly metaphor. If you applied a metaphor-based approach to each idea in your concept map, you
would find many new ways to express your message.

Rhetorical Devices Appropriate for Communication Design

Allusion is an informal and brief reference to a well known person or cultural reference. In the magazine cover linked
below, an allusion is used to underline the restrictive nature of the burqa, a full body cloak worn by some Muslim
women, by applying it to Sarah Jessica Parker, an actor whose roles are primarily feminist in nature. (Harris, 2013)
Follow the link to see an example:
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_6YrCK0O5xBw/SeDYHUDq3tI/AAAAAAAAAFs/Paovl5_nz04/s1600/eyes.jpg
Amplification involves the repetition of a concept through words or images, while adding detail to it. This is to
emphasize what may not be obvious at first glance. Amplification allows you to expand on an idea to make sure the
target audience realizes its importance. (Harris, 2013)
Follow the link to see an example:
http://www.designboom.com/cms/images/jenny/jobsintown/jobsintown03r.jpg
Analogy compares two similar things in order to explain an otherwise difficult or unfamiliar idea. Analogy draws
connections between a new object or idea and an already familiar one. Although related to simile, which tends to employ
a more artistic effect, analogy is more practical; explaining a thought process, a line of reasoning, or the abstract in
concrete terms. Because of this, analogy may be more insightful. (Harris, 2013)
Follow the link to see an example:
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_6YrCK0O5xBw/SeDGd7brAVI/AAAAAAAAAB0/XwcXgtS1UY8/s1600/LUNGS.jpg
Hyperbole is counter to understatement. It is a deliberate exaggeration that is presented for emphasis. When used for
visual communication, one must be careful to ensure that hyperbole is a clear exaggeration. If hyperbole is limited in its
use, and only used occasionally for dramatic effect, then it can be quite attention grabbing.
Follow the link to see an example:
http://n-tiffany0811fmp.blogspot.ca/2011/02/mark-studio.html
A written example would be: There are a thousand reasons why more research is needed on solar energy.
Or it can make a single point very enthusiastically: I said “rare,” not “raw.” I’ve seen cows hurt worse than this get up and walk.
Hyperbole can be used to exaggerate one thing to show how it differs from something to which it is being compared:
This stuff is used motor oil compared to the coffee you make, my love.
Hyperbole is the most overused rhetorical device in the world (and that is no hyperbole); we are a society of excess and
exaggeration. Handle it like dynamite, and do not blow up everything you can find (Harris, 2013).
Metaphor compares two different things by relating to one in the same terms commonly used for the other. Unlike a
simile or analogy, metaphor proposes that one thing is another thing, not just that they are similar (Harris, 2013).
Follow the link to see an example:
http://media.iqads.ro/2009/09/ikea-bigger-storage-ideas-full.jpg
Metonymy is related to metaphor, where the thing chosen for the metaphorical image is closely related to (but not part
of) that with which it is being compared. There is little to distinguish metonymy from synecdoche (as below). Some
rhetoricians do not distinguish between the two (Harris, 2013).

Oxymoron is a paradox presented in two words, in the form of an adjective and noun (“eloquent silence”), or adverbadjective (“inertly strong”), and is used to impart emphasis, complexity, or wit (Harris, 2013). See Figure 2.3 for another
example.

Figure 2.3 Example of an oxymoron

Personification attributes to an animal or inanimate object human characteristics such as form, character, feelings,
behaviour, and so on. Ideas and abstractions can also be personified. For example, in the poster series linked below,
homeless dogs are placed in environments typical of human homelessness (Harris, 2013).
Follow the link to see an example:
http://www.thechase.co.uk/work/manchester-dogs-home-street-life/
Simile is a comparison of one thing to another, with the two being similar in at least one way. In formal prose, a simile
compares an unfamiliar thing to a familiar thing (an object, event, process, etc.) known to the reader. (Harris, 2013)
Follow the link to see an example:
http://designbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/billboards-ads-creative-019.jpg
Synecdoche is a type of metaphor in which part of something stands for the whole, or the whole stands for a part. It can
encompass many forms such that any portion or quality of a thing is represented by the thing itself, or vice versa (Harris,
2013).
Follow the link to see an example:
http://40.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfthryFqOH1qaz1ado1_500.jpg
Understatement deliberately expresses a concept or idea with less importance as would be expected. This could be to
effect irony, or simply to convey politeness or tact. If the audience is familiar with the facts already, understatement may
be employed in order to encourage the readers to draw their own conclusions (Harris, 2013).

2.5 DEVELOP CONCEPTS • 35

For example: instead of endeavouring to describe in a few words the horrors and destruction of the 1906 earthquake in San
Francisco, a writer might state: The 1906 San Francisco earthquake interrupted business somewhat in the downtown area.

An excellent online resource for exploring different rhetorical devices is http://www.virtualsalt.com/
rhetoric.htm (Harris, 2013). The definitions above have been paraphrased from this site.
Developmental Stages of Design
No design work should ever be done without going through an iterative development process in which you try out
different ideas and visual approaches, compare and evaluate them, and select the best options to proceed with. This
applies to both form and content.
The development of the concept starts with brainstorming as wide a range of ideas as possible, and refining them
through a number of development stages until you are left with those that solve the communication problem most
effectively.
The development of graphic forms starts with exploring a wide range of styles, colours, textures, imagery, and other
graphic devices and refining them through development stages until you are left with those that best reinforce the
concept and message.
The development process starts with thumbnails and works through rough layouts and comprehensives to the final
solution. Thumbnails are small, simple hand-drawn sketches, with minimal information. These are intended for the
designer’s use and, like concept maps, are visuals created for comparison. These are not meant to be shown to clients.
Their uses include:
•
•
•
•

Concept development and visualization of ideas
Preliminary evaluation of content (they allow you to sift and sort ideas quickly and effectively)
Preliminary evaluation of form (value studies, compositional studies, potential placement of elements)
Note-taking (a tool to record verbal or visual information quickly and accurately)

Quantity is very important in thumbnails! The idea is to get as many ideas and options down as possible.
Designers typically take one of two approaches when they do thumbnails: they either brainstorm a wide range of ideas
without exploring any of them in depth, or they come up with one idea and create many variations of it. If you use
only one of these approaches, force yourself to do both. Brainstorm as many ideas as possible, using a mix of words and
images. The point here is the quantity of ideas — the more the better. Work fast and don’t judge your work yet.
Once you have a lot of ideas, take one you think is good and start exploring it. Try expressing the same idea with
different visuals, from different points of view, with different taglines and emotional tones. Make the image the focal
point of one variation and the headline the focal point of another. The purpose here is to try as many variations of an
idea as possible. The first way of expressing an idea is not necessarily the best way, much like the first pancake is not
usually the best.
After you’ve fully explored one idea, choose another from your brainstorming session and explore it in the same way.
Repeat this with every good idea.
Roughs are exactly that — rough renderings of thumbnails that explore the potential of forms, type, composition, and

36 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

elements of your best concepts. Often a concept is explored through the development of three to five roughs. These are
used to determine exactly how all of the elements will fit together, to provide enough information to make preliminary
evaluation possible, and to suggest new directions and approaches.
The rough:
• Uses simple, clean lines and basic colour palettes.
• Accurately renders without much detail (the focus is on design elements, composition, and message)
• Includes all of the visual elements in proper relationship to each other and the page
Comps are created for presenting the final project to the client for evaluation and approval. The comp must provide
enough information to make evaluation of your concept possible and to allow final evaluation and proofing of all
content.
The comp:
• Is as close as possible to the final form and is usually digital
• May use final materials or preliminary/placeholder content if photographs or illustrations are not yet
available
Hand-drawn or Digital?
Comps might be hand-drawn when you are showing a concept for something that doesn’t yet exist, such as a product
that hasn’t been fabricated, a structure that hasn’t been built, or to show a photographer how you want material to be
laid out in a photograph that has not yet been taken. Although you could create these comps digitally, it’s often more
cost effective to create a sketch.
Designers sometimes create hand-drawn comps in order to avoid presenting conceptual work that looks too finished to
a client, so they will not be locked into a particular approach by the client’s expectations.
Even in this digital age, you should draw all thumbnails by hand (using pen, pencil, or tablet) for the following reasons:
• You don’t have to make time-wasting decisions that you shouldn’t be making at this early stage (e.g., what
typeface should I use? what colour should this be?)
• It’s much faster than doing it digitally.
• Work done on a computer tends to look finished and professional, and this can trick you into thinking an
idea is better than it is.
• The technology of a tool tends to define the way it is used. If you are using a computer, you will tend to come
up with solutions that can be executed only on a computer, and that limits your creative options. For
example, would you think of creating an illustration from coloured paper if you were using the computer?
• Hand-drawn sketches provide a paper trail that shows your concept development process and can be
presented in case studies to reveal your entire design process in a more personal and engaging way.

2.6 Implement Solutions
Alex Hass

Step 4: Solution Implementation
In this step, we are ready to select the final concept options and carry their application through to completion in
producing the final design(s). This part of the process requires that you know how to work with photographers and
illustrators, as well as with people in production technologies — primarily, programmers and printers. You may also
require project management skills. You should also put a process in place so your final solutions can be evaluated for
their effectiveness. Did they work? Did they achieve their goals?
There are many components that require attention during the production phase:
Production and Implementation
•
•
•
•
•

Copy placement and preparation of layouts from approved text
Liaison with suppliers and subcontractors
Completion of photography, illustration, charts/graphs, icons/symbols
Ongoing client liaison for proofreading and corrections
Scanning and electronic preparation of images (black and white, duotones/tritones, colour); may include
colour correction and/or digital manipulation
• Preparation of electronic files in line with press/prepress/web requirements
• Supervision of all prepress materials (final files and proofs)
• Organization, maintenance, and archiving of all digital materials related to the job
Production Supervision

•
•
•
•
•
•

Discuss production options with client, solicit quotes, and select printer/programmer
When contract is awarded, liaise with production services to discuss and refine project details
Prepare or review production specifications
Liaise with client and production to check proofs
Oversee production to ensure quality control
Follow up after production work is complete

Evaluation
Every step of a project should be evaluated in terms of the goals you have defined. Two fundamental questions about
every design decision you make are:
• What does this accomplish?
• How does what is accomplished help to meet the project goals?

37

38 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

After the original design challenge has been defined, evaluate every stage of the process in that context. It’s surprisingly
easy to stray off track when you’re designing. If you find yourself designing something brilliant, but it doesn’t
communicate what it should to the right audience, then all that brilliance is wasted.
Communication

Whether they are in print or multimedia, all design works are intended to communicate to a specific audience, and the
design must support that function. All concepts must be evaluated with that end in mind. For example:
• Does the work communicate the key message(s) and support the client’s goals?
• Does the work effectively integrate images, design, and text (form and content) to support that
communication; create an overall ‘look’; make the piece work as a unified whole with no distractions?
• Is the piece physically easy to read and/or understand?
• Do the design choices amplify material (subject matter, mood) in the text?
• Is the piece appropriate to the audience? (children, youth, adults, seniors have particular interests and needs)
Economic Efficiency

• What is possible and most effective within the budget?
• Will this method attract the desired audience/buyer?
Design and Materials

• Are the design choices compatible with technological requirements for production?
• For print materials, is there efficient and economical use of paper?
• Will the materials chosen support the intended use and method of distribution?

2.7 Summary
Alex Hass

Communication design can be described as a problem-solving process that can be broken into four steps: (1) define, (2)
research, (3) develop concepts, and (4) implement solutions. Research should be a part of all design process determined
by the scope and budget of the project. Concept mapping is a non-linear approach that outlines what is known, what is
needs, creates associations and themes, and helps generate ideas. Good design takes time that involves generating and
assessing concepts. Time is also spent editing, revising, refining , and evaluating ideas.
In conclusion, defining the design process is complicated as it has many stages and involves many steps at each stage.
Complicating it further is the reality that every project is unique in its parameters, goals, time period, and participants.
This chapter is meant to facilitate the beginning of how you define your individual design process by basing it on
general guidelines. If you are still developing an understanding of your personal design strengths and weaknesses, allow
extra time for each stage and track your time for each stage. You’ll soon discover if you fall into the category of a
brainstorming, conceptual, or project development type. Conceptual designers find it easy to develop multiple concepts,
but less easy to take the steps to develop them to their full potential. Project development types are the opposite —
finding concepts hard to create, but developing projects quite easy. Allow extra time to discover which category you fall
into and also to develop strengths in your weaker area. As you gain experience developing design projects, you will start
to personalize your design process and be able to estimate how long it takes with a fair degree of accuracy. This will
help you to estimate project design costs more accurately and gauge the steps needed to bring a project to a successful
conclusion.

3.1 Introduction
Alex Hass

Learning Objectives
•
•
•
•
•
•

Utilize basic design principles relating to visual composition
Define design terminology pertaining to form
Describe organizational systems and core principles for layout grids
Differentiate between typographic categories
Establish a visual hierarchy within a layout
Express ideas using the principles of composition and form

Communication design is essentially the crafting of a message meant for a specific section of the public. This written
message is infused with meaningful and relevant visual components. The composition of these components should
amplify, clarify, and enhance the message for the viewer. To assist in making sound design choices, a designer applies
principles of composition and principles of organization to the design elements selected for a project.
Understanding how to utilize the fundamentals of design elements, principles, and composition is necessary to be able
to confidently move through the stages of the design development process and build a project from the initial design
brief to the final published design work.
Definitions from various design sources about what comprises a design element are consistent for the most part, but
defining design principles is not as consistent and varies from one text to the next. Marvin Bartel’s (2012) definitions
of these categories are both simple and on point. He defines a visual element as any “basic thing that can be seen,” and a
design principle as a method for “arranging things better.” Also included in this chapter are organizational systems that
can focus and direct the overall direction a composition will take.

3.2 Visual Elements -- Basic Things That Can be Seen
Alex Hass

Point, line, and plane are the building blocks of design. From these elements, designers create images, icons,
textures, patterns, diagrams, animations, and typographic systems. (Lupton & Phillips, 2014, p. 13)

Figure 3.1 Design using points, lines, planes

Point
A point is a precise position or location on a surface. In purely mathematical terms, a point marks a set of coordinates
— it has no mass at all. In this objective definition, a point is essentially a place. Visually, a point is a dot and therefore
the basic building block of every variation of line, texture, and plane.
Subjectively, the term point has a lot of power. Point can direct attention, be the focus of attention, create emphasis,
and cut through veiled information. The compositional term focal point brings the objective and subjective together
by being the first place the eye is drawn to in a composition and usually contains the most important piece of visual
communication.
Line
A line is the second most basic element of design — a line is a collection of points arranged in a linear manner (see
Figure 3.2). A line connects two points, or traces the path of a movement. A line can be actual or implied — for instance,
as a composition of two or more objects in a row. Lines in nature act as defining planes — examples are a horizon or
the silhouette of a forest against the sky. Long straight lines do not often occur in nature, and therefore when they
are present, they tend to dominate the landscape visually. Natural settings are usually parsed by the eye into shorter
sequences of curved or straight lines and organic shapes.
When made by the hand, a line is created by the stroke of a pencil, pen, brush, or any mark-making tool. These lines can
be thin or wide, and are expressive and distinct, reflecting the texture of the tool used to make them. Lines can create a

43

44 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

Figure 3.2 Lines (by Ken Jeffery)

plane (a shape) by being clustered together or by defining a shape. If the line is thickened, it changes and becomes a plane.
When lines are made digitally, they can acquire many of the same qualities possessed by hand-drawn lines through the
application of effects.
Plane

Figure 3.3 Planes

Like lines, planes (shapes) can be organically made or they can be geometric, as in the example shown in Figure 3.3. A
plane is a flat surface that has defined borders. “A line closes to become a shape, a bounded plane” (Lupton & Phillips,
2014, p. 38). Planes are excellent compositional tools for clustering visual elements into visual fields. A plane can also
act as a separating device and allow the viewer to see that one section of information is not linked to another.
In design software, a vector graphic is a shape created by defining its parameters with a line, and then filling it with a

3.2 VISUAL ELEMENTS -- BASIC THINGS THAT CAN BE SEEN • 45

solid or textured fill. Grids help to create and define typographic planes that float or interact with solid planes of image,
texture, or colour. In the physical world, everything is composed of shapes that are either two- or three-dimensional.
How you choose to organize and arrange the planes in your photograph, your illustration, or your design will structure
the composition and determine not only how the elements intersect with one another but also how the viewer interacts
with the composition.
Colour

Figure 3.4 Colours

Graphic design has evolved over the last two centuries from a craft that designed text and images primarily in black and
white for books and broadsheets, to a craft that works with full colour in analog and digital media and on every kind of
substrate. Controlling and effectively using colour to support communication is now more important than it has ever
been. Both media and advertising have become very sophisticated over the last few decades and are adept at creating
exciting, sensuous, and energetic environments that are crafted with the skillful use of colour and texture. The public,
in turn, has absorbed these unprecedented levels of image saturation with a variety of outcomes. One is an expectation
that the visual palette match and enhance the message. A second outcome is a high expectation for strong and authentic
visuals of places or objects. A third outcome is a cultural nostalgia for earlier looks created by various devices. Examples
like 8-bit graphics or 1950s Kodachrome both possess unique colour and texture palettes and have properties the public
can discern. When one of these nostalgic colour palettes is applied to an image, it adds another layer of meaning to the
work, and that meaning has to make sense for the viewer.
The explosion of tools for making and sharing digital photography and graphics also reveals how good the general
public has become at crafting visuals with relevant atmosphere and texture. The bar has been raised very high with
colour use in contemporary times, and understanding colour basics is an absolute necessity.
RBG and CMYK Colour Spaces
Given that design and colour are united in every project, it is important to realize that there are two colour systems, and
often a project needs to work in both. Digital media works in the additive colour system, and its primary colours are red,

46 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

green, and blue (RGB). In this system, the absence of colour equals black, while combining all colours results in white.
RGB is the colour system of visible light (see Figure 3.5). This light system is called additive because the three primaries
together create all the hues in the spectrum.
Subtractive colour is the system needed for print media, and its primary colours are cyan, magenta, yellow, and
black (CMYK), as shown in Figure 3.5. In CMYK, the absence of colour equals white, while combining all colours
creates black. Both of these systems have many overlapping colours but their colour spheres are not exactly the same.
Understanding where the overlaps e xist and where they don’t correspond is vital to the success of a project. If your print
materials cannot be replicated on screen, you will have a major design problem that will have to be corrected. Always
choose colours that will work in both systems.

Figure 3.5 Primary colours for the additive and subtractive colour
schemes

Environment is another aspect of colour choice that is very important. Both the natural world and the world within
the screen vary from moment to moment and screen to screen. Colours are affected and influenced by the amount of
atmospheric light available to them as well as by the colours in contact with the object they are viewing. Texture also
changes our perception of a colour as does the brightness or darkness around it.
However much a designer hopes to define the parameters of a colour palette, there will always be unknown factors
influencing the palette on the viewers’ end. Create a palette that is focused enough to create the right atmosphere and
energy level for your project, but one that doesn’t rely too heavily on a specific colour. Careful, considered colour use
will help define a message and create a mood that supports the composition and concept of a design work. Always create
a palette that will work with both colour systems and also be robust enough to work in less than optimal environmental
circumstances.
Negative Space
Negative space, which is also called white space, is the visually quiet area that surrounds the active area of a composition
(see Figure 3.6). It is also referred to as figure/ground, and has a very important role in composition as it shapes the
visual perception of the subject. Without negative space, there is no positive space — the effect is similar to seeing a
polar bear in a snowstorm. Negative space is often thought of as as passive and unimportant, but the active elements or
‘figure’ are always perceived in relation to their surroundings by the mind of the viewer. The composition of the negative
space frames and presents the active elements in a flat or dynamic way. If the surrounding area is busy with many other
elements, the focal point loses its power because the elements all have a similar visual value. The works of Gustav Klimt
exhibit this quality.
If, on the other hand, the work is balanced and the negative space is active, it brings energy to the form and its space.
The focal point or figure increases its visual power because there is contrast for the eye. Another way to look at this is
to see that the range or gamut of visual activity is increased and therefore the experience is more satisfying to the eye.

3.2 VISUAL ELEMENTS -- BASIC THINGS THAT CAN BE SEEN • 47

Figure 3.6 Example of negative or white space

When designers play with reducing or confusing positive and negative space, they create ambiguity. Ambiguity creates
tension, which increases the interest of a composition to the viewer and also increases the visual energy of a design.
There are three types of figure/ground relationships.
Stable figure/ground is the most common type. The positive element is clearly separate and defined against its negative
space. A good example of this is text blocks in magazines or books.
Reversible figure/ground is the second type and is found in most of the work of M.C. Escher. Both the positive and
negative space delivers ‘active’ information that feels equal to the eye and therefore creates a toggling effect in the viewer.
One shape is comprehended while the other acts as its negative space, then the opposite happens and the negative space
becomes meaningful and its opposite becomes the neutral ‘holding’ space.
Ambiguous figure/ground creates a confusing lack of focal point. The eye searches for a dominant visual ‘starting point’ in
the composition but can’t find one. Often this creates energy, and if the effect is compelling, it invites the viewer to stay
with the work for a long period of time, absorbing all of the visual information.

Figure 3.7 FedEx express truck

Designers often utilize figure/ground in the crafting of symbols, wordmarks, and logos because of its capacity to create

meaning with the space surrounding a mark. An excellent example of figure/ground is the FedEx wordmark (see Figure
3.7). The negative space needed to define the letterforms also augments their meaning by creating a forward pointing
arrow. In print design, negative space can also allude to what is outside the frame and makes the field of the page or
poster larger that it physically is. On a static or moving screen, negative space has the ability to change the flow of time,
to introduce a break, or to create space around an important point.
Composing strong figure/ground tension is an excellent skill to acquire for designers of any media. Crafting white space
eventually becomes as important to a designer as selecting the words and the elements of a project. Composing the
negative spaces of a composition will allow you to vary visual emphasis of the elements, and control and increase the
visual energy overall.
Texture

Figure 3.8 Example of texture

Texture is a visual and a tactile quality that designers work with (see Figure 3.8). Texture is used both in composition
and also on the printed substrate or media space. Designers create textures for their projects with anything at hand. A
texture can be made with typography, generated in raster or vector software like Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator, or by
using a camera and capturing elements in the material world.
Using texture thoughtfully will enhance a visual experience and amplify the context for the content. Often adding
texture adds visual complexity and a bit of visceral depth to a two-dimensional design project. It can also tie one piece
of design to another, or become a defining element of a brand or a series of communications.
The tactile aspect of a design work comes into play with the choices we make for the substrate we print on. The surface
can be smooth or rough, glossy or matte, thick or thin, translucent or opaque, paper, plastic, concrete, metal, wood, or
cloth. Paper can even have two or more of these qualities if we augment the original look of the paper with layers of
varnish that reverse the tactile effect of the substrate. Often the choice of substrate is most effective if it is sympathetic to
or contrasts with the concept and content of the piece. The choice of substrate texture affects how the viewer perceives
the content — both physically and optically. Glossy substrates often feel sophisticated, hard, and cold. They are imbued
with a sense of precision because the ink sits on top of the surface of the paper and retains almost all of its original
integrity. A textured matte paper feels organic, accessible, and warm because the ink is partially absorbed by the paper,
and is therefore influenced by and fused to its softer characteristics.
Pattern is part of the element of texture, but because of its special ability to hold content that is meaningful, and its
long and significant cultural history, it deserves a special mention. All patterns can be reduced to dot and line and are
organized by a grid system of some kind. Their ‘flavour’ is a reflection of the culture and time they come from and of

3.2 VISUAL ELEMENTS -- BASIC THINGS THAT CAN BE SEEN • 49

the materials that created them. Patterns can be a subtle addition to the content of any design work. A pattern can be
created using a relevant graphic (like a logo) or repeated multiple times, or it can support the organizational principles
developed by the designer in a decorative way; for example, if a grid is based on the square and the texture of the pattern
is also based on the square.
When the pattern is seen as a whole, its individual components melt away and lose their identity to the larger field of
the pattern. This ability to focus on a pattern in multiple ways creates a second purpose for the graphic element (such
as a circle, a square, a logo, or symbol) the designer has used. In modern design practice, pattern is an opportunity to
augment the clean and simple material surfaces we work with and ornament a page or a website with a relevant texture.
Typography

Figure 3.9 Typography

Typography is the medium of designers and the most important element we work with (see Figure 3.9). Typography not
only carries a message but also imbues a message with visual meaning based on the character of a font, its style, and its
composition. Words are meaningful in and of themselves, but the style and composition of words tells a reader you are
serious, playful, exciting, or calm. Typography is the tonal equivalent of a voice and can be as personal or as general in
flavour.
Typography traditionally has two functions in most design projects. One function is to call attention to or to ‘display’ the
intent of a communication. This function is called titling or display typography and it is meant to call attention to itself.
The second function is to present the in-depth details of a communication within a text block. This function requires a
different typographic approach — one that is quiet and does not call attention to itself. Instead, it is intended to make
the content accessible and easy to read.
Font Categories
There are many ways to categorize and subcategorize type. This overview discusses the seven major historical categories
that build on one another. Serif fonts comprise four of these categories: humanist, old style, transitional, and modern.
Italics, first designed in the 1500s, have evolved to become part of a font ‘family’ and were at one time a separate
category. They were initially designed as independent fonts to be used in small pocket books where space was limited.
They were not embraced as text fonts, but were considered valuable for adding emphasis within a roman text and so
became part of the set of options and extensions a font possessed. The trajectory of use is the opposite for the sans serif
category. Sans serif fonts have historically been used for display only, but in the 20th century, they became associated
with the modern aesthetic of clean and simple presentation and have now become very popular for text-block design.
Egyptian or slab serif fonts can be used as either display or text depending on the characteristic of the font design.

50 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

Blackletter

Figure 3.10 Example of Blackletter type

Blackletter was the medieval model for the first movable types (see Figure 3.10). It is also know as Block, Gothic, Fraktur,
or Old English. The look of this font category is heavy and dark. The letterforms are often condensed and put together
tightly in a text block creating a dark colour (tone) for a page — between 70% and 80% grey. To put the tone in context,
the usual tone of a modern text page is between 55% and 70% grey. The look of the letterforms makes it hard to read the
page, because legibility was not their first function as it is today. The beauty of the font and the form of the book was the
primary goal for early publications. Books were considered to be objects of wealth and beauty, not solely as a means to
convey information.
Humanist

Figure 3.11 Example of Humanist type

Humanist fonts are also referred to as Venetian, because they were developed in and around Venice in the mid-15th
century (see Figure 3.11). Their design was modelled on the lighter, open serif letterforms and calligraphy of the Italian
humanist writers. The designers strove to replicate many of the characteristics found in this writing style, including
multiple variations of a glyph (letterform) that a written document possessed. For instance, a font could have up to 10
different lowercase a’s to set a page with. Humanist types were the first roman types. Though they were much easier

3.2 VISUAL ELEMENTS -- BASIC THINGS THAT CAN BE SEEN • 51

to read and lighter on the page than blackletter, they still created a visually dark and heavy text block in contrast to
the fonts we have become accustomed to. Humanist fonts have little contrast between the thick and thin strokes — the
strokes are usually heavy overall. The x-height of a humanist font is small compared to contemporary fonts, and this
impedes quick comprehension and legibility. Humanist fonts are not often used for these reasons, though they are well
respected because they are the original model so many other fonts are based on. It is important to remember that these
fonts were a perfect match to the earliest printing technologies and that those presses could not have printed our light
and delicate fonts. Fonts have evolved alongside the technological advancements of the printing industry.
Examples of humanist fonts include Jenson, Centaur, Verona, Lutetia, Jersey, and Lynton.
Old Style

Figure 3.12 Example of Old Style type

Old style fonts, also known as Garalde fonts, are the next leap in font design, and their stylistic developments were
driven by the technological advancement of presses and the improved skills of punchcutters (see Figure 3.12). Font
designers began to explore the possibilities of their medium — both the metal of the punches and the abilities of the
presses and their papers. The letterforms became more precise, their serifs more distinct. The contrast of the stroke
weights was also increased, and the presses held true to the design and didn’t distort them. The aim of these new fonts
ceased to be about replicating the look of handwriting and more about refining the letterforms to create a lighter overall
tone.
Examples of old style fonts include Goudy Old Style, Granjon, Janson, Palatino, Perpetua, Plantin, and Sabon.
Transitional

A few centuries later, font design was again refined, and this time the impetus came from France and the Enlightenment
movement. Fonts were created along the rationalist principles of the times. The strokes were contrasted further with
very thick main strokes and very thin sub-strokes, and the serif, which capped the stroke, did not use bracketing
(the rounding underneath the intersection of the two strokes). The letterforms took on a look that implied they were

52 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

Figure 3.13 Example of Transitional type

constructed mathematically and anchored within a grid. These new fonts broke with humanist and old style tradition
and ceased to reference calligraphy.
Examples of transitional fonts include Baskerville, Bookman, Fournier, and Joanna (see Figure 3.13).
Modern

Figure 3.14 Example of Modern type

Modern fonts are also known as Didones and take the contrast started by the transitional fonts much, much further (see

3.2 VISUAL ELEMENTS -- BASIC THINGS THAT CAN BE SEEN • 53

Figure 3.14). Bodoni is an excellent example font as nearly everyone can bring to mind the extreme contrast of its thick
and thin strokes. The Frenchman Didot and the Italian Bodoni were the first to bring this design style to the public. Its
major attributes align with the Romantic period’s aesthetics.
Romantic letters can be extraordinarily beautiful, but they lack the flowing and steady rhythm of the
Renaissance forms. It is that rhythm which invites the reader to enter the text and read. The statuesque forms
of Romantic letters invite the reader to stand outside and look at the letters instead. (Bringhurst, 2004, p. 130)
The major characteristics of modern fonts are extreme contrast between thick and thin strokes, clean, unbracketed,
hairline serifs, and a completely vertical axis. These fonts have an almost mechanical look because of their precise, sharp,
and clean appearance. They also possess an elegance that complrments the time period they emerged in. Modern fonts
are often used as display fonts and can sometimes be used for text, though very carefully.
Examples of modern fonts include Fenice, Zapf Book, New Caledonia, Bodoni, and Didot.
Egyptian

Figure 3.15 Example of Egyptian type

Egyptian is also known as slab serif, square serif, or mechanical (see Figure 3.15). This category of font was created in
England in the 1880s — a design expression of the industrial revolution. The category was named Egyptian because
of the popularity of all things Egyptian after Napoleon’s return from a three-year Egyptian expedition. The name of
the style has nothing to do with any element of Egyptian culture. The style was created initially for display copy, but
over the centuries, fonts like Clarendon have become popular for setting text blocks because they contain the quality of
objectivity and yet still feel traditional.
Examples of Egyptian fonts include Officina Sans and Officina Serif, Clarendon, and every typewriter font.
Sans Serif

Sans serif fonts have existed since ancient times, but it was only in the late 19th century that font designers began to

54 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

Figure 3.16 Example of Sans Serif

consider removing serifs and letting the letterforms stand on their own (see Figure 3.16). These fonts were initially
considered appropriate only for titling and display purposes, and only became text fonts in the hands of the 20thcentury modernists. The first sans serif forms were created on the early humanist and old style calligraphic forms, but
eventually the forms were influenced by objective modernist principles and geometry.
Examples of sans serif fonts include Univers, Helvetica, and Akzidenz-Grotesk.

3.3 Compositional Principles -- Strategies for Arranging Things Better
Alex Hass

We have many words for the frustration we feel when an interface isn’t directing us to what we need to know.
Loud, messy, cluttered, busy. These words. . . express our feeling of being overwhelmed visually by content
on a screen or page. We need them to express how unpleasant a user experience it is to not know where to
direct our attention next. (Porter, 2010, para 1)
If everything is equal, nothing stands out. (Bradley, 2011)
The proper composition of visual elements generates not only visual stability, it enhances mood through composition
and generates order that prevents visual chaos. Designers use compositional rules in their work to make the reader enter
their work and experience a design environment that is calm yet exciting, quiet yet interesting. A magazine designer,
for example, creates a grid and applies an order to the typographic elements creating a comprehensible hierarchy. This
design system is interpreted in different ways, in pages and spreads, issue after issue. If the organizational system is
versatile and planned with thought and depth, it can be used to produce unique and exciting layouts that remain true to
the rules determined for the overall system initially designed. Organizational principles create a framework for design
without determining the end results.
Compositional rules can be used to generate content as well as organize it. The Bauhaus artist and designer Laszlo
Moholy-Nagy created a series of paintings by calling in a set of instructions to a sign painter using the telephone. Here
is his account of the experience, written in 1944:
In 1922 I ordered by telephone from a sign factory five paintings in porcelain enamel. I had the factory’s color
chart before me and I sketched my paintings on graph paper. At the other end of the telephone, the factory
supervisor had the same kind of paper divided in to squares. He took down the dictated shapes in the correct
position. (It was like playing chess by correspondence). (Moholy-Nagy, 1947, p. 79)
Designing visual elements into a strong composition is a complex endeavour on its own, but increasingly designers are
being asked to create vast compositional systems that other people will implement. Much like Laszlo Moholy-Nagy,
designers need to be able to make strong compositional systems and also convey how their systems work, how to apply
their rules, and how to apply them so they retain a relevant freshness.
Alignment

Figure 3.17 Alignment (by Ken Jeffery)

Alignment refers to lining up the top, bottom, sides, or middle of a text, composition, or grouping of graphic elements

56

3.3 COMPOSITIONAL PRINCIPLES -- STRATEGIES FOR ARRANGING THINGS BETTER • 57

on a page. Often a design composition includes a grid where the alignment of text blocks is dictated by the design of the
columns of the grid (see Figure 3.17).
Typographically, horizontal alignment includes flush left (also called left justified or ragged right), flush right (also called
right justified or ragged left), centred, and fully justified. Vertical alignment in typography is usually linked to baseline
alignment. A baseline grid exists in digital software that is meant for layout of type and is the invisible line where font
characters sit.
Contrast
Contrast is a visual device that increases the special character of both elements that have been paired. Contrast assists
composition by creating focal points, and adds energy and visual range to a composition. Using contrast enables us to
distinguish the qualities of one object by comparing differences with another. Some ways of creating contrast among
elements in the design include the use of contrasting colours, sizes, and shapes. Johannes Itten, a design instructor
and artist at the Bauhaus focused his research on the concept of contrast in both composition and colour. Itten’s list
of contrasts can be applied to both the composition and the atmosphere of a design work. His list includes these
pairings: large/small, hard/soft, thick/thin, light/heavy, straight/curved, continuous/intermittent, much/little, sweet/
sour, pointed/blunt, light/dark, loud/soft, black/white, strong/weak, diagonal/circular. No design makes use of only
one kind of contrast, but usually one dominates the others.
Colour Contrast
Johannes Itten also worked with contrast in his seminal theory of colour and determined that there are seven kinds of
contrast.
1. Contrast of hue occurs when a hue or colour is separated by being outlined in black or white lines. White
lines weaken the ‘strength’ and appearance of the colour and the colours around the white lines seem darker.
In contrast, a black line around a colour strengthens the appearance of the colour, while the colours around
the black lines appear to be lighter.
2. Light-dark contrast is the contrast between light values and dark values.
3. Cold-warm contrast refers to the contrast between cool and warm colours. Warm colours are the red,
orange, and yellow colours of the colour wheel, while cool colours are blue, green, and purple.
4. Complementary contrast is the contrast between colours directly opposite each other on the colour wheel.
5. Simultaneous contrast occurs between two colours that are almost complementary. One colour is one
section to the left or right of the complementary colour of the other.
6. Contrast of saturation refers to the contrast between intense colours and tertiary or muted colors. Muted
colours appear duller when placed next to intense colours, and intense colours appear more vivid when next
to a muted colour.
7. Contrast of extension refers to the contrast between the area of one colour and another. Different areas of
one colour are needed to balance another.
For text, contrast is achieved by using varied colours, serif and sans serif, type styles that are not often paired, or type in
place of an image. As contrast in elements diminishes, the elements begin to feel similar, and the level of visual interest
decreases.

58 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

Emphasis
A focal point in a composition draws the eye to it before the eye engages with the rest of the visual information. This is
called emphasis and is achieved by making a specific element gain the attention of the eye. Emphasis is created in graphic
design by making only one focal point and clearly emphasizing it by placing the elements on the page in positions where
the eye is naturally drawn to the proper entry into the work. Designers rely on additional compositional principles to
support the hierarchy of a composition such as contrast, repetition, or movement.
Designers use emphasis to assist viewers in identifying the relative importance of each element in a composition.
Emphasis is strongly linked to visual hierarchy. Both emphasis and visual hierarchy create order for the viewer, allowing
the eye to see the first element of importance, then the second, then the third, and so on. Graphic elements gain or lose
emphasis by changing in size, visual intensity, colour, complexity, uniqueness, placement on the page, and relationship
to other elements.
Movement

Figure 3.18 Example of movement

Movement is made by creating visual instability — like motion in a photograph that blurs the image, as shown in the
example in Figure 3.18. Creating the illusion of movement photographically or artistically is not difficult because a blur
translates into movement in the mind of the viewer. However, it is not the only option for a designer. A composition
can also achieve movement if the graphic elements are arranged in a way that directs the eye to move in a specific
direction — usually by creating a diagonal that takes the eye up to the right corner (forward motion) or down to the left
corner (backward motion). Movement can also be created using overlapping planes that imply depth and distance by
becoming progressively smaller and lighter in tone (mimicking depth). Using typography as a visual medium is also an
option. Overlapping the text blocks and/or sentences effectively creates both depth and movement (though it destroys
legibility). David Carson is a designer who often uses this technique to create movement in his work.

3.3 COMPOSITIONAL PRINCIPLES -- STRATEGIES FOR ARRANGING THINGS BETTER • 59

Scale
Varying scale (size) is one of the major tools in the designer’s toolbox. Changing scale is important on two levels. The
first is purely compositional — a composition needs variety in the size of its elements to be dynamic and effective. If all
the elements have the same visual weight, the composition will be flat. Another aspect to varied scale is conceptual. If a
design visually distorts the size relation of one element to another, the viewer is instantly engaged in discovering why.
This is a great method to engage the viewer and add a twist to the message embedded in the design. A great example of
this is the ‘think small’ ad campaign of the 1960s for Volkswagen Beetle.
The series is witty and engaging and plays on how we perceive size. This distortion is witty and playful, and presents
smallness as desirable. Subtle scale differences do not make much visual impact, but large ones are very dramatic.
The concept and context of a project should determine the relationship of scale differences for a composition. Large
differences in scale are suited to dramatic and energetic design content, while smaller differences in scale are
appropriate for professional and institutional content.
Proximity and the Gestalt Theory of Visual Relationships
Proximity of elements is part of Gestalt theory, which is a framework of spatial relationships developed in the 1920s by
the German psychologists Max Wertheimer, Wolfgang Kohler, and Kurt Koffka. The term Gestalt means unified whole,
and points to the underlying conceptual structure of this framework. Gestalt works because the mind seeks to organize
visual information. A composition created using Gestalt principles predetermines how each of the elements within it
interacts with the others spatially. In this system of relationships, close proximity of objects, regardless of shape, size,
or content, indicates a connection. There are six basic Gestalt principles: (1) similarity, (2) continuation, (3) closure, (4)
proximity, (5) figure/ground, and (6) symmetry and order.
Similarity

Figure 3.19 (by Ken Jeffery)

When visual elements have a similar shape or look as one another, a viewer will often connect the discrete components

60 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

and see a pattern or grouping (see Figure 3.19). This effect can be used to create a single illustration, image, or message
from a series of separate elements. Similarity of medium, shape, size, colour, or texture will trigger a sense of similarity.
The sense of grouping will be strengthened or weakened by increasing or decreasing the commonality of the individual
elements.
Continuation

Figure 3.20 (by Ken Jeffery)

Continuation is the tendency of the mind to see a single continuous line of connection rather than discrete components
(see Figure 3.20). The eye is drawn along a path, line, or curve, as long as there is enough proximity between objects
to do so. This tendency can be used to point toward another element in the composition, or to draw the eye around
a composition. The eye will continue along the path or direction suggested by the composition even when the
composition ends, continuing beyond the page dimensions.
Closure

Closure is a design technique that uses the mind’s tendency to complete incomplete shapes (see Figure 3.21). The
principle works if the viewer is given enough visual information to perceive a complete shape in the negative space. In
essence, the mind ‘closes’ a form, object, or composition. In the example above , the triangle is formed by the viewer’s
mind, which wants to close the shape formed by the gaps and spaces of the adjacent circles and lines. The partial triangle,
outlined in black also hints at the missing shape.
Proximity

Proximity is an arrangement of elements that creates an association or relationship between them (see Figure 3.22). If
individual elements are similar, they will probably be perceived first as a whole and second as discrete components. If,
like the example above, some of the components form to create a large ‘whole,’ similar elements positioned away from
the main shape will also be associated with the large shape. In this case, the viewer interprets them as falling off or away
from the main shape. The shapes used do not have to be geometric to create the effect of proximity. Any components

3.3 COMPOSITIONAL PRINCIPLES -- STRATEGIES FOR ARRANGING THINGS BETTER • 61

Figure 3.21 (by Ken Jeffery)

Figure 3.22 (by Ken Jeffery)

have a strong commonality in shape, colour, texture, size, or other visual attribute can achieve proximity. Proximity can
also be achieved with dissimilar shapes and textures if cleverly and conceptually composed.
Figure/Ground

Figure/ground was discussed earlier, but it is part of Gestalt theory, so we present it here again. This principle describes

62 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

Figure 3.23 (by Ken Jeffery)

the mind’s tendency to see as two different planes of focus, information in both positive and negative space (see Figure
3.23). It works if those spaces are suggestive enough in their composition.
Symmetry and Order

Figure 3.24 (by Ken Jeffery)

Symmetry and order follow the premise that a composition should not create a sense of disorder or imbalance (see
Figure 3.24), because the viewer will waste time trying to mentally reorder it rather than focus on the embedded content.

3.3 COMPOSITIONAL PRINCIPLES -- STRATEGIES FOR ARRANGING THINGS BETTER • 63

The photographic example in Figure 3.25 is composed symmetrically and allows the viewer to concentrate on the figure
in the centre. Achieving symmetry in a composition also gives the composition balance and a feeling of harmony.

Figure 3.25 Example of symmetry and order

Rhythm
Rhythm is integral to the pacing of a design composition and is also necessary for creating a pattern, as used in the
example in Figure 3.26. The pacing of a repeating motif or element at regular or irregular intervals within a design
determines the energetic quality of a composition; it also creates a consistent and unifying backdrop for the introduction
of new elements.
Rhythm is the effect produced in a magazine or book by varying the placement of elements within the grid structure.
The changes in the density of elements and visual tones of the spreads translate into a rhythmic visual energy as the
energy of each page grows or shrinks. Rhythm is the glue that connects one page to the next; it reveals recurrent themes
and creates movement, tension, and emotional value in the content. When viewers understand the rhythm of a book,
a magazine, or a website, they will also appreciate the variations that break with or punctuate the rhythm and create
interest, change, or tension.
Repetition
Repetition creates visual consistency in page designs or in visual identities, such as using the same style of headline, the
same style of initial capitals, and the same set of elements, or repeating the same basic layout from one page to another
(see Figure 3.27).
Excessive repetition, however, creates monotony. This usually leads to viewer boredom and dull, uninteresting
compositions for the designer. Be sure to create a design system that allows the repetitions within it to be lively and
interesting page after page. The example above uses a simple set of rules, but because the rules allow for colour and
compositional changes, each discrete component is as interesting on its own as it is within the whole. If you cannot
avoid excessive repetitions, try to add some visual breaks and white spaces where the eyes can rest for a while.

64 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

Figure 3.26 Example of rhythm

Figure 3.27 Example of repetition

Balance
Balance and symmetry are important design qualities because they are deeply embedded in human DNA. Because our
bodies are symmetrical, we have a strong association and satisfaction with centred, symmetrical design. Balancing visual
elements compositionally calms the tensions and grounds the design (see Figure 3.28). This is important if you wish
to convey a sense of stability to the viewer. When we look at a design, we use our innate sense of what constitutes
‘right balance’ to assess its stability. If that stability is missing, we feel tension, which can counteract the core of the

3.3 COMPOSITIONAL PRINCIPLES -- STRATEGIES FOR ARRANGING THINGS BETTER • 65

message. Centred design compositions work very well for stable, security-inspiring content, but what about content that
demands attention, or tension, or excitement?
When a centred (or stable) composition is not desirable, developing an asymmetrical composition is the best strategy.
Asymmetry has been explored in graphic design for the last 150 years, and designers continue to discover new strategies
that feel fresh. Asymmetry has no empirical rules but is guided by balancing the distribution of main elements around
the space of a composition in an unexpected way. Contrast and counterpoint are the main tools of composition in
asymmetry — large shapes balance small ones; intense colours balance neutrals. Creating asymmetrical design is not
easy because there are no firm rules to follow, but it is exciting to create and exciting to see for exactly the same reason.

Figure 3.28 Example of balance

Hierarchy: Dominance and Emphasis
Simply put, hierarchy is applying an order of importance to a set of elements. Hierarchical order is apparent in every
facet of our lives and is a defining characteristic of our contemporary culture. Hierarchy can be very complex and
rigorous — an instruction manual is a good example of this. It can also be uncomplicated and loose. Hierarchy in
composition is conveyed visually through variations of all the elements — size, colour, placement, tonal value, and so on
(see Figure 3.29).
Graphic design does not always embrace hierarchy. There are some messages that are more suited to visual anarchy
and chaos (Punk design is a good example). These projects often connect to an audience by experimenting with, and
breaking free from universal rules of visual structure. It is important is to match the structure of the composition to the
needs of the project.
Typographic hierarchy is very important in design. A body of text is made more comprehensible by imposing order
through a system of titles, subtitles, sections, and subsections. Hierarchy is created when the levels of the hierarchy are
clear and distinguishable from one another. Subtle signs of difference are not effective. Typography acts as a tonal voice
for the viewer, and must create clear variation in tone, pitch, and melody.
Hierarchy is usually created using similarity and contrast. Similar elements have equality in typographic hierarchy.

66 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

Figure 3.29 Example of hierarchy

Dominant and subordinate roles are assigned to elements when there is enough contrast between them. The bigger and
darker an element is, the more importance it has. Smaller and lighter sizes and tones imply lesser importance.
Every hierarchy has a most important level and a least important level. The elements that fall between the two are ranked
according to size and position. However, if you subdivide the text with too many levels, the contrast between different
levels will blur their differences in the hierarchical order.
A good strategy to follow with text design is to apply three levels of typographic hierarchy.
Title

The function of a title is to attract the reader to the content of the text block. Often, the title is visually ‘flavourful’ and
possesses a strong visual dynamic and energy.
Subtitle

Second-level typography gives the reader the ability to distinguish between types of information within the text
block. This level of type includes subheads, pull quotes, captions, and anything else that can help detail and support
understanding of the text-block information.
Text block

The text block is the content. As opposed to the ‘display’ function of the title and subtitle, the function of the text block
is to make the content legible and easy to digest visually. Readers should be able to decide if they want to read this level
based on primary (title) and secondary (subtitle) type levels.
Typically, a typographic hierarchy will convey information from general to specific as it progresses from title to text
block. The general points presented in the title will be the most important and will be seen by most everyone. Think of

3.3 COMPOSITIONAL PRINCIPLES -- STRATEGIES FOR ARRANGING THINGS BETTER • 67

how a newspaper is scanned for interesting news items: If readers are interested in the title, they may choose to read
more detailed and in-depth information in the associated text block.

3.4 Organizational Principles
Alex Hass

Compositional organization is complex, but even more so when applied to typography. Typography is a complicated
medium to work with as it contains two levels of information (display and content), and requires its components to be
read in proper sequence with proper emphasis, good legibility, and strong contrast to the substrate. Many elements need
to be organized to allow the reader a seamless experience when reading the content. Designing with type requires adept
handling of the hierarchy, refining and designing the display elements for focal emphasis and also refining the quiet
details of the text block so it sits perfectly and quietly in its space.
Think of these organizational systems as ‘large picture’ constraints. Constraints (rules) allow a designer to focus on the
other aspects of a project. Designers make myriad decisions about concept, style, visuals, form, font, size, spacing, colour,
placement, proportion, relationships, and materials. When some factors are determined in advance, the designer is able
to spend time with the other parts of the project. A well-defined constraint can free up the thought process by taking
some decisions off the table. The following eight organizational systems cover composition for type (but can also be
applied to general composition), including the traditional ordering system of the grid.
Grid
A grid is a network of lines that structure the placement of elements and create relationships between them. A grid
divides a design space into vertical and horizontal divisions. The grid is a bridge between a design rationale and the
beginning of implementation for each project, converting a concept into a structured space. It is an exceptional tool for
composing, arranging, and organizing every kind of visual element. The grid usually works invisibly in the background,
but it can become an active, visible element as well. Designers use grids in a variety of ways. They can be very disciplined
about adhering to their grid structure from the beginning of a project, or use it as a starting point for composition and
order.
Grid systems create a formal composition in comparison to more casual compositional approaches like transitional or
random structures. Grids are often used in publication and web design because they introduce consistency and guide
hierarchy. Consistent margins and columns create an underlying structure that unifies the multiple pages of a document
or website, and makes the layout process more efficient.
The plan for the grid comes from the content and concept of the design project. The objective in creating a grid is to
set up the relationships between elements in a way that stays true to the concept. For instance, if your publication is a
book of poetry, the grid must have generous amounts of negative space and generous leading. If, on the other hand, your
publication is a daily newspaper, the spacing relationships cannot be so generous, and have to clearly show which article
relates to which image. Hierarchy of information must be very clear as well, and should reveal which news item is most
important and which is least important. A well-made grid will naturally allow the designer generous scope for variation
in image style, text size, and graphic style. Often, a grid that is complex allows for some freedom where the designer can
introduce a new element or effect.
A grid activates the entire surface of a project by making all of it available for active elements. It helps create both stable
symmetrical and dynamic asymmetrical compositions. By breaking down space into smaller units, grids encourage
designers to leave some areas open rather than fill up the whole page.

Types of Grids

Figure 3.30 The golden section

The golden section is also known as the golden ratio, golden mean, or divine proportion, and it is found in mathematics,
geometry, life, and the universe — its applications are limitless (see Figure 3.30)
The golden section is a ratio — a relationship between two numbers — that has been applied as an organizational system
in art, design, and architecture for centuries. Expressed numerically, the ratio for the golden section is 1 : 1.618. The
formula for the golden section is a : b = b : (a+b). In other words, side a is to side b as side b is to the sum of both sides.
Graphic designers use the golden section to create grids and layouts for websites and books. Photographers use it to
compose the focal point of an image and also to compose the elements found in an image.
Single-Column Grid
A single-column grid is an excellent approach if the content a designer is working with is formatted in a simple manner
(see Figure 3.31). Content that is appropriate for a single-column grid consists of main text for the text block, a few
levels of display type, possibly some images, and finally page numbers.
The main column of this style of grid must sit properly on the page, held in place by the negative space that surrounds it.
To determine the right amount of negative space on the top, bottom, and sides of the page, a designer usually considers

70 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

Figure 3.31 Single-column grid (by Ken Jeffery)

facing pages as a spread. In books and magazines, the two-page spread, not the individual page, is the main unit of
design. The designer determines the right amount of negative space on the top and bottom, gutter (inside margin), and
outside edge. The spread is often symmetrical, and the pages mirror one another.
Multi-Column Grid

Figure 3.32 Multi-column grid (adapted by Ken Jeffery)

When a designer creates a grid for a document that is complicated, he or she may use multi-column grids because they
allow for a complex hierarchy and provide more options for integrating text and visuals (see Figure 3.32). The more
columns you create, the more flexible your grid will be. You can use the grid to articulate the hierarchy of the publication
by creating zones for different kinds of content. The columns act as visual units that can be combined or kept separate.

3.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PRINCIPLES • 71

A photo can span several columns or be reduced to the width of only one. A text can also occupy a single column or span
several.
Hang Lines

Figure 3.33 Hang lines (adapted by Ken Jeffery)

In addition to creating vertical columns in a grid, you can also divide the page horizontally. Often, a designer determines
the placement of hang lines (see Figure 3.33) by applying the rule of thirds (breaking up the horizontal plane into three
equal parts). This compartmentalization allows the designer to reserve certain sections for images and others for the
text block.
Modular Grid

Figure 3.34 Modular grid (adapted by Ken Jeffery)

The modules of this type of grid are always identical and are created by applying consistent horizontal and vertical

72 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

divisions to the design space. Like the written notes in a musical score, the modules allow you to anchor your layout
elements and typography to a specific rhythm. With a modular grid, the horizontal guidelines are tied to the baseline
grid that governs the whole document. Baseline grids serve to anchor most of the elements to a common leading
(typographic line spacing). See Figure 3.34.
Baseline Grid
A baseline grid is the horizontal grid that determines where all of the type will sit. You can also use it to determine the
placement and edges of your visual and graphic elements. To create a baseline grid, determine the right font, size, and
leading for your text block, then go to your baseline grid settings (found with the other grid preferences) and change the
baseline grid default (usually 12 pt) to the leading you will be using in your text block.
Axial
The axial system has a simple premise — all elements are arranged on either side of an axis or line. You can centre
the axis itself in the composition or, for a more energetic asymmetrical composition, place the axis off centre to
either the right or left. This compositional strategy creates a dynamic negative space on the opposite side. To create
a more complex composition, designers often employ an axial system combined with another — like the radial or
dilatational system (see below). They may also use double-axis compositions with the axes either parallel to each other,
or intersecting to create a strong focal point. There are many instances of the axial system in nature — tree trunks, roots,
and vines are good examples. Like these organic examples, an axis does not need to be a straight line — it can be curved,
zigzag, or circular.
Modular
Modular organization is a compositional method that utilizes rigour (by constraining the shape) and freedom from
structure (modules can be any size and placed anywhere in the space). Modules can also be uniform and contained
within a structure (a grid). A module is a fixed element used within a larger system or structure. For example, a pixel is a
module that builds a digital image.
Bilateral
The bilateral system is based on mirrored symmetry and is therefore both classic and ubiquitous. Because of its
predictability, it is a challenge for designers to work with. Nature exhibits many examples of bilateral composition — the
bodies of mammals, the points of a snowflake, and the fractal symmetry of plants are all quickly understood, appreciated,
and then dismissed by the viewer. To create a composition based on the bilateral system, a designer must make some
part of the composition unusual. The designer can achieve this by moving the axis to a diagonal, off-centre location,
which allows the negative space on either side of the bilateral composition to be varied. A second method is to introduce
a double axis: the designer uses two columns of bilateral information and varies the size of each.
Radial
The radial system takes its name from the sun — all elements are arranged like rays coming from a central focal point.
This is a dynamic compositional strategy as it references dynamic action. Examples of the radial form from the natural
world, such as explosions, flowers, spiders, stars, and so on, are all exciting and dynamic. Much like it is difficult to
handle the natural objects, reproducing a radial composition is not that easy. There are problems with legibility unless
type is very carefully placed and scaled. Every line of type starts and ends in a different place, so continuity is also hard
to control. For example, a designer may take a traditional approach so the text reads from top to bottom, or an inverse

3.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PRINCIPLES • 73

approach so the text reads from bottom to top. Arranging the text on either side of centre may also be effective. It is
important to try placing the type in different positions and in different relationships until it works with the composition
and is easy to read.
As in the organizational systems we have discussed, designers can add radial points for a more complex composition or
combine a radial system with one that adds stability, such as a grid, axial, or modular system.
Dilatational
Dilatational systems mimic the look of still water when a pebble is dropped into it, creating rings of greater and greater
size as they move away from the centre. Like the radial system, this composition has a strong focal point, but unlike the
radial system, the composition creates rings, not rays, that expand from the centre. Other examples of this system are
the iris of the eye or representations of sound waves.
Random/Spontaneous
Creating a composition that does not follow any compositional principle is not as easy as it sounds. Finding examples
of randomness is also one of the most difficult exercises for design students. Random design does not follow any rule,
method, direction, or pattern. If a project calls for randomness, it is best to start with materials that are conducive
to spontaneity like Jackson Pollock’s paint throws. Allow the elements that fall to organize themselves naturally —
eventually, a dynamic and fresh composition should emerge. Random compositions exhibit visual qualities that are not
patterned, aligned, or horizontal. Instead, they tend toward compositions that exhibit overlapping, cropping, angling,
and textures.
Transitional
The transitional typographic system is defined by the layering of lines of text into informal textured planes and shifting
tonal bands. The shapes and bands created with this layering approach are not aligned with one another, and create an
overall organic atmosphere. This visual approach is often used in Post Modern design where the clear legibility of text
is not as important as the visual atmosphere of the design. Text planes in Post Modernist works point the viewer to the
main theme of the message rather than articulate the message in clean, concise text arrangements.
Compositions using the transitional approach have a light, airy look that abstractly imply cloud formations or wood
grain patterns rather than solid concrete shapes created by using the grid or axial systems. A transitional composition
has lively and active negative space, and can create an excellent ground for a vital focal point if it is in sharp contrast to
the rest of the composition.

3.5 Summary
Alex Hass

Exploring the design possibilities that the organizational systems discussed in this chapter possess is an endless
undertaking. Once these systems are innately understood individually, a designer can begin to play with layering two
systems within one design project. Combining contrasting systems often works well. For instance, an axial system
combined with a radial system tempers the axial system’s linear focus and anchors and diffuses the rays emanating from
the radial shapes. A grid combined with a dilatation system gives the composition both vertical and horizontal structure
that is softened by the rounded shapes. Organizational systems give the designer ways to distribute words or images
within a structure while allowing negative space into the centre of the design space.
Compositional strategies are design constraints. The definition of a design constraint is to apply or impose limitations on
the elements or design of a system. The compositional strategies (systems) discussed above are in fact design constraints,
and they should be understood as parameters that assist the designer in the design process rather than as restraints that
limit the designer’s creativity. Parameters are necessary in every visual system. Applying a visual organizational system
also allows the designer to focus on the message and the details of a design project rather than on the structure of the
composition that holds the work together. Visual systems create visual unity.

4.2 Colour Science
Alan Martin

The Colour Event
The first challenge in dealing with colour in graphic reproduction is to learn to think of colour as an event rather than
as an attribute or characteristic of a particular object.
Colour is an event because it requires the participation of three components at a particular point in time to take place.
In addition to the object, we require a light source and an observer. Only with the interaction of these three things —
object, light, and observer — can we have a colour event or experience.
We need some help from three branches of science, physics, physiology and psychology, to understand how the object,
light, and observer contribute to the colour event. If you like memory aids, you can use the acronym POLO to remind
you of the three science P’s and the object, light, and observer.
Object
The object and light fall under the domain of physics, while we need both physiology and psychology to describe the
observer’s role in the colour event.
The object’s role is to interact with light, and the object can either reflect light back from its surface or transmit light
through itself. Reflectance and transmission are the two potential interactions. The majority of objects are opaque, so
most of the time we are dealing with the reflection of light. If an object is semi-opaque, and transmits a portion of light,
we refer to it as translucent.
Light
Visible light is a tiny sliver of the total electromagnetic spectrum. The electromagnetic spectrum contains all forms of
energy, ranging from kilometre-long radio waves at one end and progressing in shortening wavelengths down through
microwaves, infrared waves, ultraviolet waves, X-rays, and finally, gamma waves with wavelengths of a subatomic
dimension (see Figure 4.1).
Visible light is nestled in-between the infrared and ultraviolet range (see Figure 4.2). The progression from longest
to shortest wavelength is from red (following infrared) to violet (preceding ultraviolet) in the 700 to 380 nanometre
(millionths of a metre) wavelength distribution.
We describe the temperature (relative warmness to coolness) of light in degrees Kelvin. Typical daylight ranges
from 5000 to 6500 degrees Kelvin. We use the labels D50 and D65 to indicate daylight-viewing conditions at these
temperature points.

Observer
The greatest complexity of the colour event occurs in the interaction with the observer. The science of physiology, the
study of the human body’s functions, provides half the story. Psychology, which provides insights about the function of
the mind, completes the tale.
We begin with how our eyes, our optic systems, respond to light. Trichromacy and opponency are the key concepts.
Trichromacy
We call it ‘visible’ light because it is the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that our eyes are sensitive to. The two
types of receptors in our eyes are cones and rods (see Figure 4.3). The cones respond to colour and the rods come into

4.2 COLOUR SCIENCE • 81

Figure 4.3 Rods and cones (adapted by Ken Jeffery)

play in low-light situations when we see only varying shades of grey. There are three types of cones, each sensitive to
approximately one-third of the visible spectrum. We characterize those segments of the spectrum as red, green, and
blue, and this three-colour or trichromatic response by the cones is where all colour experience begins. Every colour
we perceive comes from mixing varying volumes of the red, green, and blue signals from the three types of cones in our
eyes.
The Additive Primaries
We refer to the red, green, and blue colour set (RGB) as the additive primaries. When we combine or add all three of
these, we get the entire spectrum and, thus, white light. This is the primary colour set involved whenever we talk about
the transmission of light, such as the display on a computer monitor, a tablet, or from a projector. For this reason, red,
green, and blue are also referred to as the transmissive primaries.
The Subtractive Primaries
What happens when we project two of the three additive primaries on top of each other? This is the same as removing or
subtracting one of the additive primaries from white light. Let’s start with red and green. Though not at all intuitive, if
you have any experience with mixing paint or inks, the combination of red and green light produces yellow. Remember
that we are adding light to light, so the production of a brighter colour is to be expected. Continuing on: combining
green and blue gives us a light blue that we call cyan, while the combination of red and blue produces magenta.
Since each of these colours is produced by subtracting one of the additive primaries from the full complement of white
light, we refer to this colour set of cyan, magenta, and yellow (CMY) as the subtractive primaries. Each of the subtractive
primaries acts as a filter for its complementary colour in the additive primary colour set. Cyan absorbs all red light,
reflecting only green and blue. Magenta absorbs all green light, returning only red and blue; while yellow absorbs all
blue light and reflects back only red and green. What colour would you see if you shone green light on a magenta patch?

82 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

Just as we can produce any colour sensation in the transmission of light by mixing the appropriate quantities of red,
green, and blue, we can produce the corresponding colour sensation when we put ink on paper by absorbing the
necessary portions of the visible spectrum so that only the required amounts of red, green, and blue are reflected back.
This is how cyan, magenta, and yellow work as our primary colours in the printing environment, and why we also call
them the reflective primaries.
Opponency
The second half of the role that our human physiology plays in the observer’s part of the colour event is the concept
of opponency. Our eyes’ tristimulus response (a response to the red, green, and blue portions of incoming light) is the
input, but the interpretation occurs when we map that input to a location in a colour space determined by three axes of
opposing sensations. We have a built-in colour map where we define our colour perception by identifying the perceived
colour based on its degree of greenness to redness, blueness to yellowness, and darkness to lightness.
These three pairs of opposites — green-red, blue-yellow, dark-light — are the fundamental guide posts we use to
position any colour we perceive on our internal colour map. These opponent colour pairs are exclusive colour entities,
occupying opposing ends of the range of our interpretation. Unlike a yellowish-orange or a reddish-purple, we cannot
imagine a colour having the properties of red and green or blue and yellow at the same time.
Lab Colour Space

Figure 4.4 (by Ken Jeffery)

Once the opponent nature of colour interpretation was understood, colour scientists were able to create a model colour

4.2 COLOUR SCIENCE • 83

space based on the opposing pairs. This is the Lab colour space (see Figure 4.4). The Lab variation of interest to us is
officially called CIELAB, and all references in this textbook to Lab will mean CIELAB. Additionally, references to L, a,
and b in this textbook are equivalent to the L*, a*, and b* units of the CIELAB colour space. Each of the opposing pairs
provides one axis of this three-dimensional colour space. L is the axis for darkness to lightness; a is the axis for greenness
to redness; and b is the axis for blueness to yellowness. By providing a value for each of the L, a, and b attributes, a colour
is accurately and uniquely located in the colour space. The tremendous utility of the Lab colour space is that it allows
for the mathematical description of a colour in a non-ambiguous and meaningful way.
Psychology of Colour Perception
We come to the last of our three science P’s: psychology. After the trichromatic response is passed to opponent
interpretation in the physiology of our optic systems, the final engagement of colour perception occurs in our minds.
This interaction complicates and potentially confounds our objective measurements, so it is critical to be aware of the
typical issues that the filter of our mind brings to the arena of colour perception.
Colour Constancy
Colour constancy is how our mind adjusts our colour perception to discount or remove the effects of an overall colour
cast due to a coloured illuminant. If we see someone wearing a yellow sweater illuminated by a bluish cast of light, we
still ‘see’ a yellow sweater, even though we have no trouble identifying the colour in the sweater as green if it is isolated
from the scene. In our mind, we remove the blue constituents of all colours in the scene that we assume are coming from
the tint in the light source. This behaviour is also known as chromatic adaptation.
The effect of adjacency is very similar to colour constancy. A colour placed next to a light colour appears darker than
when that same colour is placed next to a dark colour (see examples in Figures 4.5 and 4.6). We make adjustments to our
interpretation based on our assessment of the environment.

Figure 4.5 Both greens are the same colour (by Ken Jeffery)

The effect of colour constancy provides a very important lesson in judging our success in colour matching: it is more
important to preserve the overall colour relationships in our image than to focus on individual colour accuracy.

84 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

Figure 4.6 Both reds are the same colour (by Ken Jeffery)

Memory Colours
In our mind’s eye, not all colours are created equal. Due to their historical importance to our survival, we pay special
attention to certain colours. Flesh tones, the blue of the sky, and the greens of grass are known as memory colours due
to the additional weight they have in our hierarchy of colour.
We need to give these memory colours a priority when we evaluate our colour management efforts. If these key colours
aren’t right, then everything will look wrong.
The significant impact of our mind’s contribution to colour perception enforces the requirement to take colour
matching beyond the raw numbers we can extract from the physics and physiology of light’s interaction with an object
and our optic systems. The psychological components such as colour constancy and memory colours can only be
accommodated by human intervention in a colour management system.

4.3 Measuring Devices
Alan Martin

We measure light to provide the data needed to manage colour in a graphic production environment. There are three
ways to measure light and three corresponding tools available to take those measurements: densitometer, colorimeter,
and spectrophotometer.
Densitometer
To measure only the volume of light, we use a densitometer. The densitometer provides a known volume of light and
then records what remainder of that light is returned to the device. A transmissive densitometer records how much light
gets through a semi-transparent material such as camera film, and a reflective densitometer measures how much light
has bounced back. The majority of densitometers in the print environment are reflective.
How does measuring the volume of light help us? Maintaining a consistent thickness of ink in printing is a very good
way to control consistency and quality, and measuring the amount of light absorbed by the ink is a very accurate
indicator of ink thickness.
Since our eyes have to function over a very wide range of brightness, we have a non-linear response to increasing
volumes of light. That means it takes approximately 10 times the amount of light for us to experience one step in our
perception of brightness. To match this behaviour of our eyes, the density scale is based on powers of 10, with each
larger whole number representing one-tenth the volume of light of the preceding number. A density reading of 1.0
means that 1/10 of the original light has been reflected back. This is a typical reading for a process Yellow patch in
offset lithographic printing. A density reading of 2.0 indicates that 1/100 of the original light is returned, while a density
reading of 3.0 shows only 1/1000 coming back. Black ink is usually in the 1.7 density range, with cyan and magenta at
1.3 to 1.4.
Scanning or hand-held densitometers are typically found in the viewing station by a press. Densities are recorded when
the printed sample matches the desired result and then ongoing adjustments to maintain the target densities keep the
printing on target.
Colorimeter
Colorimeters mimic the three-colour response of our eyes by using red, green, and blue filters to measure the amount
of light present in each third of the spectrum. They have built-in software to calculate Lab values based on what volume
of red, green, and blue is returned from a sample. Colorimeters are particularly useful for calibrating and profiling
monitors. Some well-known examples of colorimeters are the X-Rite ColorMunki or i1 Display devices.
Spectrophotometer
Spectrophotometers measure slices of the spectrum to produce a spectral ‘map’ of the light reflected back from
a sample. Spectrophotometers are typically more expensive than densitometers and colorimeters but are employed
because they can more accurately do the jobs of both devices. They work by recording the light at specific wavelengths

85

86 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

over the wavelength range of visible light, and then by converting this spectral data to colorimetric and densitometric
values.
While we are talking about measuring spectral values, it is important to note that we do not depend on identical spectral
values to achieve matching colour experiences. Different spectral values can trigger the same volume of colour signals in
our optic system and lead to matching colour perception. In fact, we depend on this phenomenon in graphic production
in order for proofing devices to simulate the colour output of a printing press or for any two devices to be colour
aligned. The ability of the CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) process colour set to mimic most of the colours in the
world is also based on the fact that we can achieve a colorimetric match without having identical spectral values.

4.4 Lab Colour Space and Delta E Measurements
Alan Martin

The CIE (Commission Internationale d’Eclairage or International Commission on Light) is a scientific body formed by
colour scientists in the 1930s that has provided much of the fundamental colour knowledge we possess today. Three
core definitions provided by the CIE are the standard observer, the Lab colour space, and Delta E measurements. The
latter two are particularly important for colour management.
The Lab Colour Space Revisited
In section, 4.2, we mentioned the Lab colour space as a natural outgrowth of understanding the function of opponency
in human vision. It’s comprised of three axes: L represents darkness to lightness, with values ranging from 0 to 100; a
represents greenness to redness with values of -128 to +127; and b represents blueness to yellowness also with values
from -128 to +127.
Notice that there are no negative values on the L axis as we can’t have less than zero light, which describes absolute
darkness. The L axis is considered achromatic meaning without colour. Here we are dealing with the volume rather
than the kind of light. In contrast, the a and b axes are chromatic, describing the colour character and the type of light.
The standard two-dimensional depiction is of only the a and b axes, with a as the horizontal axis and b as the vertical
axis. This places red to the right, green to the left, blue at the bottom, and yellow at the top. If you found our previous
mnemonic aid of POLO helpful, you can use RGBY to remember the colour pairs. For correct placement, remember
that red is on the right, and blue is on the bottom.
Colours are more neutral and grey toward the centre of the colour space, along the L axis. Imagine that equivalent
values of the opposing colours are cancelling each other out, reducing the saturation and intensity of those colours. The
most saturated colours are at the extremes of the a and b axes, in both the large positive and negative numbers. For a
visual depiction of the Lab colour space, open the ColorSync application found in the Utilities folder of any Macintosh
computer and view one of the default profiles such as Adobe RGB.
Now it’s time to explore the practical application of this colour map for the comparative analysis of colour samples.
We can’t make any progress in evaluating our success in colour matching unless we have a frame of reference, some
yardstick to determine how much one colour sample is similar or different from another. That yardstick is the Delta E
measurement.
Delta E
Delta, the fourth letter of the Greek alphabet and symbolized as a triangle, is used in science to indicate difference. Delta
E is the difference between two colours designated as two points in the Lab colour space. With values assigned to each
of the L, a, and b attributes of two colours, we can use simple geometry to calculate the distance between their two
placements in the Lab colour space (see Figure 4.7).
How do we do that? It looks a lot like the formula used to determine the long side of a right triangle that you may

87

88 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

Figure 4.7 (by Ken Jeffery)

remember from high school geometry. We square the difference between each of the L, a, and b values; add them all
together; and take the square root of that sum. Written out as a formula it looks a little more daunting: Root ((L1-L2)^2
+ (a1-a2)^2 + (b1-b2)^2).
Let’s try a simple example to see what we get. Colour 1 has a Lab value of 51,2,2 and Colour 2 is 50,0,0 (right at the
centre of the colour space):
L1 – L2 = 51 – 50 = 1, and 1 x 1 = 1, so our first value is 1.
a1 – a2 = 2 – 0 = 2; and 2 x 2 = 4, so our second value is 4.
b1 – b2 = 2 = 0 = 2; 2 x 2 = 4, so the third value is also 4.
Add them together: 1 + 4 + 4 = 9; and take the square root: root (9) = 3.

4.4 LAB COLOUR SPACE AND DELTA E MEASUREMENTS • 89

The Delta E (difference) between our two colours is 3. Could we detect that difference if we were viewing those two
colours? Probably just barely. The minimum Delta E for seeing a difference is about 2. Smaller differences can normally
be detected in neutral colours (such as our samples), while more saturated colours require a slightly larger Delta E. A
Delta E of 4 is the upper threshold for acceptable machine repeatability or consistency.
Delta E provides a value indicating the overall difference between two colours. It does not provide any colour-related
data such as which colour is lighter/darker, redder/greener, more blue/more yellow. To understand how the colours are
different, we have to evaluate the comparative L, a, and b differences independently.
Experimentation over time has come to show that conventional Delta E is about 75% accurate in showing the difference
we see between two colours. Delta E numbers exaggerate the differences in yellows and compress our perceptual
distance between blues. To improve on the representation of our interpretation of colour difference, scientists have
produced a modified formula known as Delta E(94).
Delta E(94)
Delta E(94) is a modified formula that provides about 95% accuracy in correlation to human perception of colour
differences. Here it is in all its splendour:
deltaE*(94) = [(deltaL*/k(L)S(L))^2 + (deltaC*(ab)/k(C)S(C))^2 + (deltaH*(ab)/k(H)S(H))^2 ]^(1/2)
where: S(L) = 1S(C) = 1 + 0.045C*(ab)S(H) = 1 + 0.015C*(ab)k(L) = k(C) = k(H) = 1 (for reference conditions)
C*(ab) = C*(ab,standard) OR [C*(ab,1)C*(ab,2)]^(1/2)
deltaH(ab) = (deltaE(ab)^2 – deltaL* ^2 – deltaC(ab)^2)^(1/2)
You can see that it is still the comparison of three values: L, C, and H, where C and H are produced by applying modifying
factors to the original Lab values to compensate for perceptual distortions in the colour space. Each difference is squared
and the root taken of the sum of the squares, just as in the original Delta E formula.
There is an additional refinement in Delta E(2000) where further adjustments are applied to blue and neutral colours
and compensations for lightness, chroma, and hue. This is a much smaller correction than the change from Delta E to
Delta E(94).
The good news is that you don’t need to understand or remember any of the details of these equations. Just remember
that these are real numbers measuring actual plotted distances between colour samples. Delta E represents the distance
between two points in the Lab colour space. Delta E(94) and Delta E(2000) are enhancements, providing improved
numbers that more closely match our perception of colour differences.

4.5 Working with a Spectrophotometer to Read Standard Colour Charts for
Output Profiling
Alan Martin

Armed with our fundamental concepts in colour theory, we can apply these principles to the physical process of
colour management. The practical application to print production requires a procedure for measurement, colour profile
generation, and the correct use of profiles in the manufacturing process. Let’s begin with measurement and discuss the
working components of a standard graphic arts spectrophotometer and the colour charts we would use it with.
X-Rite i-One (i1) Pro Spectrophotometer
The i1 Pro is one of the most common hand-held spectrophotometers used in the graphic reproduction industry.
It can also be mounted in the iO base for automated scanning. As described in section 4.3, the spectro works by
recording spectral data from incremental slices of the range of wavelengths included in visible light. To do this properly,
the spectro must calibrate its white point to establish the baseline for interpretation. It does this by reading the
white tile supplied in the baseplate that comes with the spectro. Each baseplate is uniquely matched to a specific
spectrophotometer and marked with a serial number that corresponds to its spectro. Make sure you confirm that you
have the correct baseplate that matches the serial number on your spectro. When used commercially, the manufacturer
recommends that a spectro be returned for factory recalibration every two years. The packaging will include a certificate
indicating the expiry date for the current calibration.
The spectro may also be identified (on both the serial number tag and surrounding the light-emitting aperture) as a
UV-cut. This indicates it has an ultraviolet filter, which acts to remove the impact of fluorescence from optical paper
brighteners. If you have access to more than one spectro device, be sure that any related measurements are done
consistently either with or without the filter. Best practice is to use exactly the same instrument for any series of
measurements.
The USB cable provides power to the spectro and so should be plugged directly into the computer and not into a
peripheral such as a keyboard. Additional typical accessories for the spectro include a weighted strap and screw-in base
for hanging the spectro against the screen of a monitor and a proof mount base with sliding rail for the spectro to read
printed colour targets.
Colour Charts or Targets
You will typically be dependent on the colour management software application that you have chosen to produce a pdf
file of the colour chart that your spectro can read. While in the software, you select a reading device (such as the X-Rite
i1 Pro or i1 iO) from the list of devices that the software supports and then provide the dimensions for your output
device. The choice of reading device will determine the size of colour patches and page format, and the size of output
will define how many pages are ganged to a sheet. When prompted, name the pdf with a clear identifier (output device
and date or equivalent) and save it.
Once you have the pdf, use it for any direct output, such as a proofer, or to make a plate for your printing press so that
the colour chart can be printed. In all cases, it is critical that no colour management be applied to the output device for

90

4.5 WORKING WITH A SPECTROPHOTOMETER TO READ STANDARD COLOUR CHARTS FOR OUTPUT PROFILING • 91

the production of the chart so that the natural base state of the device is captured in the colour target produced. It is
also essential that the proofer or press be in an optimal operating state so that the output is an accurate reflection of
the device’s capabilities. This may require a calibration process for a proofer or standard maintenance procedure on the
press.
There are several colour chart standards that you should be aware of. The chart produced by your colour management
software will likely be one of these or a slight variation thereof. The original standard is the IT8.7/3, composed of 928
colour patches. This was followed by the ECI 2002, which has 1,485 colour samples. There is now an update to the
IT8, the IT8.7/4, which has extended the colour sampling to 1,617 patches. The larger number of patches provides a
more detailed snapshot of the colour capability of the device that you are profiling. Of course, it takes more time to read
the greater number of samples, so the newer sets are more manageable with automated reading devices such as the iO
table. If you are reading with a hand-held spectro, choose the IT8.7/3 or smaller patch set if it is offered by your colour
management software. The other trade-off between larger and smaller numbers of colour patches lies in the smoothness
of colour transitions. Fewer data points mean less interpolation and potentially smoother curves in colour modulation.
Be aware that it will require some experimentation on a device-by-device basis to determine the ideal intersection of
accuracy and smooth interpretation for your measurement data.
The colour charts come in two standard patterns of organization: random and visual. Random is exactly that, and
comprises the vast majority of charts that are produced for measuring. The colour swatches are distributed to provide
optimal contrast between adjacent patches to aid the spectrophotometer that is reading them in distinguishing where
one patch ends and the next begins. Having the colours scattered over the sheet also generates relatively even
distribution of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black ink which leads to better performance from the press. The visual pattern
places the colour blocks in a logical and progressive sequence so it’s easy to see the chromatic ranges that are covered.
Some scanning spectrophotometers can read the visual arrangement.
Measuring Your Colour Chart
Once you have used the pdf to generate the printed sample, you have to measure the sample. For charts from proofers,
it is critical to wait a minimum of 30 to 90 minutes after the sample has been produced before measuring in order for
the colour to stabilize. To create a measurement file, you need three things: colour management software; a target from
that software; and a measuring instrument supported by the software. After connecting your measuring device to the
computer (remember to connect directly to a USB port on the computer, not to a peripheral such as a keyboard), enter
the measuring step of your colour management software. You will need to point to the correct measurement chart that
was used, which can be easily identified if you have named it distinctively, and confirm the right measuring device is
indicated. If you are getting errors once you begin measuring and can’t proceed, the typical culprit is the selection of an
incorrect colour chart or incorrect measuring device.
When you begin the measurement process, there are a few option prompts you may have to respond to. Some software
allows for the averaging of multiple press sheets to produce an improved characterization of the device. This software
can scan the colour bars placed at the bottom of the sheet and indicate which sheets are the best candidates for
measuring. If you have chosen to do multiple sheets, then you will have to record the sheet number on each of the pages
that you cut from the full press sheet in order to enter the sheet number correctly as you carry on measuring.
Proofing devices are stable enough that it is not necessary to average multiple sheets. You may still be cutting out single
pages from a larger sheet (depending on the size of your proofing device) and should label the individual pages to stay
organized. You can skip any of the prompts that deal with choosing multi-sheet options.
Once past the initial options, you will be prompted to calibrate the measuring instrument. Make sure the i1 Pro is
correctly seated on its base plate and push the button. After successful calibration, you will be instructed to mount

92 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

page 1 of your colour chart and begin measuring. For hand-held measuring with the i1 Pro, use the white plastic proof
mounting base it came with. Secure your page under the spring clip at the top of the mounting base, positioning it so
that the sliding clear plastic guide the spectro rides on can reach the first row of colour patches. The clear plastic guide
has a horizontal opening that the head of the spectro nestles into to traverse the horizontal row of colour swatches.
There is a cradle for the base of the spectro to rest on that slides horizontally across the guide. The spectro must begin
on white paper to the left of the colour patch row, and finish on white paper to the right of the row. If your target has
a semi-circle printed to the left of its colour rows, use it to position the chart under the scanning opening of the plastic
guide. The left semi-circle on the opening in the guide should align with the printed semi-circle on the chart. If there is
no printed semi-circle on the chart, allow ¼ – ½ inch of white space showing in the opening to the left of the first colour
patch.
With your chart properly placed in the mounting base, position the spectro all the way to the left on the plastic guide
with its base in the sliding cradle and reading aperture in the cut-away channel. Press the button on the left side of the
spectro and keep it pressed. Wait one second while the white of the paper is read (there may be a beep to indicate this is
done), slide the spectro smoothly and evenly to the right until you reach white paper past the colour patches, and then
release the button. You should be rewarded with a prompt to scan row B. Slide the entire plastic guide down one row,
move the spectro all the way back to the left, and do it all over again! If you receive an error, clear the prompt and try
scanning the same row again. Success at hand-held scanning comes with a little bit of practice and a Zen approach. Your
degree of success will be inversely proportional to the amount of anxiety you feel. The techniques that contribute to
getting it right are smooth and even passage of the spectro; consistent pressure (make sure you are not pushing down on
the head); white paper at either end; and keeping the button pressed from start to finish.
After you receive a couple of errors on the same row, the software may switch to individual patch reading. In this case,
the prompt will now say “Scan patch B1” instead of the previous “Scan row B.” You must position the read head over
each individual patch and press the spectro’s button when prompted on screen. After completing one row of individual
patches, you will be returned to full row scanning mode. This procedure allows the measurement process to go forward
when the software is having trouble detecting colour boundaries in a particular row.
Having completed all rows on all pages (which may take some time), you will be prompted to save the measurement file.
Some colour management software will take you directly to the additional settings required to define a profile and then
proceed with the profile creation.

4.6 The Measurement File’s Role in Colour Profiling
Alan Martin

It’s important to remember that the measurement file is not a profile! It provides the basic information about the colour
behaviour of the device but needs some critical additional instructions and the processing of the colour management
software in order to produce a colour profile that can be used for colour transformations. The measurement file is
a snapshot in time of device behaviour and depends on the appropriate calibration of the device prior to the chart’s
creation for its accuracy.
Content of the Measurement File

Figure 4.8 Example of measurement file

We can open the measurement file in a text editor and examine its structure to understand what information it contains

93

94 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

(see Figure 4.8). The first section is header info and provides some basic information about the file. This is followed
by a key to the colour data that follows. The actual colour information comprises a row and column ID to identify the
specific colour patch and then the numerical data that goes with the patch.
The key information is contained in the second section where the data format is laid out. This indicates what colour
spaces are captured in the data for each colour patch. The first four values are CMYK; the next three are XYZ (a device
independent colour space like Lab); the next three are Lab; then RGB; and finally there is a wavelength measurement for
each of the 10 nanometer slices of the visible spectrum (380-730 nanometers; violet to red).
The CMYK values for each patch are fixed in the software, coming from either the IT8 or ECI specification. These
CMYK values have to remain constant because they are our point of reference for all devices. When we read the patch
with the spectro, it uses the spectral information (each of the 10 nanometer slices) to calculate the XYZ and Lab values
that describe the colour appearance of the colour swatch. By matching the measured Lab value to the predetermined
CMYK value supplied in the original pdf, we have the raw material to build a translation table describing the device’s
colour behaviour. Once we have this look up table (LUT), we can predict the Lab equivalent for any CMYK value
produced on the device. Correspondingly, when we are given the Lab values from another device that we want to match,
we can produce the appropriate CMYK values to provide that colour appearance.
Device Dependent Versus Device Independent Colour Spaces
We’ve defined CMYK, RGB, and Lab colour spaces, and we’ve seen how the first step in colour profiling is to measure
output from a device to define a relationship between the CMYK device dependent and the Lab device independent
numbers. Establishing this relationship between device dependent (RGB or CMYK) values and device independent (Lab)
values is a fundamental component of the colour management process.
We call the CMYK and RGB colour spaces device dependent because the results we get from specific RGB or CMYK
values depend entirely on the device producing them. When we tell a device to produce “50% cyan,” we are saying, “Give
me half of as much cyan as you can produce.” Since the capacity and colour appearance of cyan from any two devices
will not be the same, it should not be surprising that a specification of “half that much” will also produce colour events
that do not match. Similarly, the RGB values on a monitor or projector simply specify some proportion of the full red,
green, and blue signals that the device can produce. Since there is no common starting point between two monitors in
terms of what a full red, green, or blue signal is, then providing the same RGB values to those two monitors will in no
way provide an opportunity to generate the same colour appearance.
For RGB devices, RGB values simply identify the volume of signal for each channel. For printers, proofers, and presses
the CMYK percentages dictate what proportion of pigments are deposited. The numbers associated with specific RGB
and CMYK colours only have colour meaning when attached to a particular device. There is no inherent consistency
between any two devices based on providing the same RGB or CMYK values.
So if the device dependent colour spaces don’t give us any consistency or control of colour between devices, where
can we turn? Enter the device independent colour spaces of Lab and XYZ. We spoke of Lab earlier as the threedimensional model colour science has produced to map the way we perceive colour. The Lab colour space is device
independent because we do not depend on the values associated with the output of a specific device to enumerate the
colour. Lab values are calculated from spectral readings in a controlled environment so that they define a consistent
colour experience for any circumstance and from any device. Device independent colour is the Rosetta stone of colour
management that allows us to translate from the unique dialect of colour behaviour on one device into a universal
language and then back to the specific colour dialect of a different device and maintain the colour meaning.
The device independent colour spaces are known as profile connection spaces (PCS) since they provide this gateway

4.6 THE MEASUREMENT FILE’S ROLE IN COLOUR PROFILING • 95

service between the device dependent colour spaces of individual devices. Lab and XYZ are the two PCS allowed
in the ICC specification that defines profile creation. From the examination of the measurement file, we can see
how it provides the first step in establishing and tabulating a relationship between the device dependent values of
a particular device’s output and the corresponding device independent values that characterize the actual colour
appearance associated with the output.
We’ve talked about the measurement file as the gateway to our profile creation, so let’s see what steps remain to get us
there.

4.7 Profile Creation
Alan Martin

Figure 4.9 (adapted by Ken Jeffery)

The measurement file contains the raw data of the relationship between the device dependent colour space of the device
and the device independent colour space of the profile connection spaces (PCS). There are two additional parameters
we have to provide along with this data in order for the colour management software to produce an output profile: total
ink limit and black generation (see Figure 4.9).
Total Ink Limit
Total ink limit is a percentage, usually between 240% and 400%, that represents the upper threshold that the sum of the
four process inks can total. Why would this change? Each device, in combination with its particular substrates (papers)
and ink sets, has a different capability in terms of how much ink can be deposited. A coldset web newspaper press might
be close to the lower end of 240%, while a high-end inkjet can support 100% from each of cyan, magenta, yellow, and
black, and have a 400% rating. This total ink limit setting affects the colour distribution in darker colours. As the total
ink limit decreases, dark colours require a higher proportion of black ink relative to CMY to stay within the ink limit
percentage. With an ink limit of 360%, when black is at 90%, we still have room left for 90% of cyan, magenta, and yellow
(4 x 90 = 360). But if the ink limit is 240%, with black at 90%, we can’t exceed 150% for the sum of the other three (150 +
90 = 240). Since cyan leads in a grey balance mix, we might have 60% cyan, 45% magenta, and 45% yellow (60 + 45 + 45
= 150). As the ink limit drops, black has to do more of the work of providing darkness for any heavy colour mix.

96

4.7 PROFILE CREATION • 97

Black Generation
We also have to provide instruction on how the black component of the CMYK mix will be created. Remember that our
subtractive primaries are CMY and that, theoretically, they provide all the colours in the visible spectrum. Where does
K (black) come in? To bridge the gap between theory and real world performance, black ink does some very important
things:
• It compensates for the spectral shortcomings of CMY inks: our inks are not perfect representations of what
cyan, magenta, and yellow colours should be.
• It eliminates registration problems in black type: if there were no discreet black ink, every time we wanted to
print black type we would have to stack cyan, magenta, and yellow on top of one another and make sure they
fit perfectly.
• It helps us achieve easier neutrals: we can use black to replace the grey component of colours reducing the
amount of CMY required to stay in balance on the press to provide consistent neutral tones.
• It provides cost savings: black ink is cheaper than coloured ink.
• It increases contrast: black’s greater density extends the tonal range of CMYK printing and improves the
appearance of the final printed piece.
Since black is an add-on to our primary CMY colour set, we must provide instructions for its creation. Typically, we
specify the black start point, maximum black, and black strength.
• Black start point: The point at which black enters colour mixes (range of 0% to 50%). If the black start point is
20%, then tones from white to 20% will carry CMY only.
• Maximum black: The upper allowable percentage of black ink used in the K separation (range 70% to 100%).
• Black strength: The relative quantity of black versus cyan, magenta, and yellow in the neutral grey
component of colours (range 5 to 75%). As the number increases, colours can contain more black.
Black strength settings are also referred to as grey component replacement (GCR) values in colour separations. These
may be set as percentages or simply as light, medium, and heavy, where more equals a larger proportion of black taking
the place of CMY in neutral tones. GCR is the successor to UCR (under colour removal), which only moved exactly
equivalent amounts of CMY to the black channel. UCR separations exhibit a ‘skeletal’ black, where there is a small
amount of content in the black separation. With GCR, and as the black strength increases, more and more content
moves into the black channel.
Final Processing
With the measurement file available, and total ink limit and black generation specified, processing can start in the colour
management software and an output profile created. It will take from two to five minutes for all the calculations to
complete. You may be prompted to specify whether to save the profile in the system or user location, or both. The
system location will make the profile available to all users of the computer, while the user location will restrict it to the
current user. Depending on your permissions at the computer, you may not be able to write into the system location.
On an Apple OS X machine, the default location for the system is System/Library/ColorSync/Profiles and for the user,
Users/(userID)/Library/ColorSync/Profiles.
Viewing Your Profile
The Mac provides a built-in tool for viewing a profile or comparing two profiles. From the Utilities folder, launch

98 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

ColorSync. Select the second tab from the left and you’ll see a selection window on the left and a display pane on the
right. The selection window contains a list of all ColorSync aware locations on your computer. Tip open the available
folders and browse to find the profile you wish to view. Select a profile and a three-dimensional representation of its
gamut in the Lab colour space appears on the right. Use your cursor to rotate the profile through all three of its axes.
From the drop-down triangle in the display pane, choose Hold for comparison. The current profile is ghosted back, and
you can select a second profile to display at full strength on top of it so you can compare the relative gamuts of the two
profiles.
Profile Limitations
Remember that your profile represents the behaviour of the device for particular imaging parameters such as a specific
substrate, resolution (screen ruling), and ink set. If any of those parameters are significantly altered, it requires a new
profile to accurately represent the colour results. For real-world applications, profiles representing related groups of
parameters are employed. One profile might represent all uncoated stock at 100 to 133 lines per inch, a second for
coated stock at 150 to 175 lines per inch, and a third for a high saturation ink set on glossy stock with high resolution
stochastic screening.

4.8 Beyond Output Profiling: Display, Input, and Device Link Profiles
Alan Martin

Up to this point, we have focused exclusively on the output profile in our discussion of profiling. This makes sense,
since this is the predominant profile we are concerned with in graphic production. Output profiles characterize output
devices such as printers, proofers, and presses, but there are other devices that we have to manage in the full spectrum
of a colour-managed workflow, and these require two additional classes of ICC profiles: display and input.
Display profiles capture the colour characteristics of monitors, projectors, and other display devices. Input profiles
characterize devices that capture images such as scanners and digital cameras.
Display Profiling
You may hear this class of profile referred to as monitor profiling, but the more accurate designation is display profiling
to acknowledge the inclusion of components beyond the monitor such as the video card and video drivers. Though less
commonly profiled, this class of profile encompasses digital projectors as well.
In preparation for display profiling, the cardinal rule of thumb is to make whatever adjustments we can in the actual
monitor. Any software adjustments to the VideoLUT (the look up table stored on the video card) reduce the operating
range of the monitor and limit the spectrum of the display. With the predominance of LCD monitors, this means that
the brightness or white luminance is the only hardware adjustment available. If you see reference to black level or
colour temperature settings, this hearkens back to CRT monitors where these were actual hardware settings. For LCD
monitors, these are software controls. For an LCD, all light comes from the backlight, which is a fluorescent array
behind a diffuser, so the only monitor control is the brightness of this backlight.
Display profile software typically combines calibration and profiling. A setting called the vcgt (video card gamma type)
tag in the display profile can download settings to the VideoLUT on the video card and change monitor behaviour. This
is an unusual deviation from the standard protocol in colour management where the profile never alters the behaviour
of the device. Calibration is used to optimize device function and characterization or profiling captures a description of
device behaviour. Normally, the application of a profile should not have any influence on the device function.
Before calibration, it’s essential to warm up an LCD monitor for 30 to 90 minutes. Check the full brightness. If the
monitor has aged to the point where it can’t achieve adequate brightness, then it should be abandoned as a candidate
for profiling. Set the standard refresh rate and resolution that will be used on the monitor. If these are changed after
profiling, then the profile cannot be considered accurate. Clean the screen with an appropriate gentle cleaner.
When you begin the profiling software, you will be prompted to identify your instrument. Colorimeters are often
provided in display profiling packages, but most software works with standard spectrophotometers (spectros), such as
the i1 Pro.
The recommended settings to enter for the set-up phase are:
• White point: D65 (6500 K)
• Gamma: 2.2

99

100 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

The setting 6500 K is usually close to the native white point of an LCD monitor. You can choose Native White Point if
you feel that 6500 is too far from the actual white point of your monitor. Gamma is the tone reproduction curve of the
monitor. The setting 2.2 typically provides the smoothest gradients in monitor display.
Next is the choice of a patch set from small, medium, and large options. This determines the number of colour swatches
that will be projected on screen for the instrument to read. The trade-off is between calibration time and colour range.
Start with the small patch set and see if you are happy with the results.
To start this process, make sure the i1 is on its base plate for the instrument calibration step and then suspend the
spectro in the monitor mounting strap on the monitor. The weight at one end of the strap hangs behind the monitor to
counterbalance the spectro, and the i1 Pro locks into the mounting plate at the other end of the strap to keep it in place
on the monitor screen. The reading aperture of the spectro should be approximately in the centre of the screen. Tip the
monitor back very slightly to help the spectro sit flat of the front of the LCD.
When you tell the software to proceed, it begins projecting a series of colour swatches that the colorimeter or spectro
records. As you did to produce the measurement file for your output profile, you are building a comparative table of
known device values (the RGB swatches projected on the screen), with device independent values (Lab readings from
the spectro) that describe their appearance. This may take from three to ten minutes. During this process, make sure that
no screen saver becomes active and you keep the mouse out of the scanning area and. If you leave before the process is
completed, check that the spectro is properly positioned when you return.
Once the colour patches are done, you will be prompted to name and save the profile. Make a habit of naming your
profile with the date so its age can be easily checked. Saving display profiles is similar to saving output profiles, where
the user chooses system and user options. With display profiles, there is no value in saving previous versions. All you are
interested in is the current state of the monitor.
To see the active profile on a Mac, choose System Preferences/Displays/Color. The active profile will be highlighted at
the top of the list. There is a check box toggle limiting the list so only profiles that are known to be associated with the
monitor show.
Input Profiles
As mentioned, we need input profiles when we capture images. There are predominantly two types of devices associated
with image capture: scanners and digital cameras. The fundamental concept in producing an input profile is that RGB
device values scanned or photographed from a target are matched to device independent Lab values either provided by
the target vendor or measured from the target itself.
For input profile creation, the targets always consist of two parts: a physical sequence of colour patches and a target
description file (TDF) with the profile connection space (PCS) values for the swatches. The TDF accuracy varies from
individually measured targets (done by you or a specialty vendor) at the high end to averaged samples from a batch run
(an economical alternative).
As with output profiling, there are standard scanner target formats. We have IT8.7/1 for transmissive originals (film
transparencies like slides) and the IT8.7/2 for reflective (photo print paper). These targets are available from a variety of
vendors and allow you to match the material of the target to the material you will be scanning. If you will be scanning
Kodachrome slides, you will want a Kodachrome IT8/7.1 target. Conversely, if your originals are Fuji photo prints, then
you will want an IT8/7.2 target on the matching Fuji photo print paper.
The X-Rite ColorChecker targets are commonly used for digital cameras. There is the original ColorChecker with 24

4.8 BEYOND OUTPUT PROFILING: DISPLAY, INPUT, AND DEVICE LINK PROFILES • 101

tiles and the later digital ColorChecker SG with 140 colour tiles. The larger target can be used for initial set-up and there
is a mini version of the original ColorChecker that will work in most photo shoots for an ongoing reference check.
Though scanners and digital cameras both fall into our domain of input profiling, they have some very different
characteristics that we have to take into account when preparing to produce a useful profile. As with output profiling,
we need to calibrate the device by stabilizing and optimizing its performance prior to capturing its colour behaviour.
In order to stabilize, we need to understand the potential variables that the device presents. Scanners have a controlled
light source and stable filters and typically have the option for extensive software intervention. In contrast, cameras
have stable filters and moderate software controls but have the potential for hugely variable lighting conditions. The
excessive variability of outdoor lighting limits useful profile creation to interior and in-studio camera work. If the
lighting conditions can be controlled adequately in the studio, then colour-accurate capture can take place and colour
accuracy can be maintained in the production work that follows.
Stabilizing a scanner’s performance comes from turning off any automatic adjustments for colour correction:
• White and black point setting
• Removing colour casts
• Sharpening
If you can’t turn these off, then the scanner is likely not a good candidate for profiling. Optimize the scanner’s behaviour
with an output gamma setting of 2.6 to 3.0.
Stabilizing a camera’s performance comes from the appropriate lighting and capture settings. Use even lighting and full
highlight and shadow exposure for target capture. For colour temperature, use grey balance for camera back devices,
and white balance for colour filter arrays (CFA). Optimize the camera’s bit depth retention with gamma 1.0 for raw
profiling.
With calibration complete, it’s time to capture the target. For a scanner:
•
•
•
•

Mount straight
Mask open bed areas
Scan as high-bit tiff
Open in Photoshop (beware of any automated conversions or profile assignments) to rotate, crop, and spot

Comparatively, for the digital camera:
• Light evenly
• Capture square
• Open in Photoshop (beware of any automated conversions or profile assignments) to rotate, crop, and spot
With the digital image in hand, we’re ready for the input profile creation. Measure the commercial target with the
spectro if you are not using a supplied target description file. Launch your colour management software and you will
be prompted to identify the target image and the corresponding target description file. The profiling software reads
the RGB values from the scanned or captured image, and the software processes the target description file and RGB
measurement file to produce the input profile. File-saving options are very similar to what we have previous described
for output and display profiles.

102 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

Device Link Profiles
Device link profiles are most closely related to the output class of profiles. A device link profile combines two output
profiles to provide the specific conversion instructions between two particular devices. It provides the opportunity to
maintain black and other separation purity (i.e., what begins as black only in the source colour space emerges as black
only in the destination colour space) by removing the need for passing the colour transformation through the PCS.
To define a device link, we identify a source and destination profile to our colour management software, specify the
rendering intent, and provide details on how constrained the re-separation should be. By avoiding the passage into and
back out of the PCS, we can very strictly control the parameters of the colour conversion. The options for conversion
are:
• Full re-separation — Complete re-separation. Solid colours in the original file may not remain solid. The
black generation parameters that you specify are used, which may result in using less chromatic ink and
more black ink.
• CMYK integrity — All colour builds can be adjusted. The relative amount of black versus CMY will be
preserved in content processed through the device link.
• Black purity only — Any colours other than the black channel (solid K, K-greys) can be adjusted.
• Colour and black purity — The same as fully constrained, but solid colours can be reduced to a tint.
• Fully constrained — Any colour made with only one or two inks will not have other inks added. Solid (100%
tints) primaries and secondaries are not affected and remain solid.
• Ink optimizing — A proprietary term in the ColorFlow colour management software for applying a full reseparation with a heavy grey component replacement (GCR) algorithm.
Colour management software used to be required to preview the results of applying a device link. With the last
few versions of Adobe Photoshop, a device link option has been added to the advanced dialog window of the Color
Conversion menu, making device link previewing much more accessible. Currently, Photoshop only supports CMYK
to CMYK device links. It does not support RGB to CMYK device links. Another alternative for viewing the results of
applying a device link is to generate a virtual proof (VPS) in Kodak Prinergy with the device link specified. For details,
see section 4.11 in this chapter.
With this extraordinary level of control, why don’t we use device links for every colour conversion? The truth is, that
with our gain in managing the colour conversion process, we sacrifice an even greater degree of flexibility. The premise
of colour management and the use of profiles is that we do not have to generate a unique profile for each pairing of
devices. With the power of the PCS gateway to provide the device independent colour description, we only need a single
profile for each colour condition of a device and any two profiles can be positioned on either side of the PCS to provide
a pathway for the colour conversion.
Where it does make sense to go to the extra trouble of generating a device link profile is a situation where a specific
pairing of two devices is used over and over again, such as a proofer for a particular press condition, or to keep two
presses in a shop matched for their colour output.
If we process an image from RGB to CMYK at the beginning of our production process, we gain the stability of having
the image in our known CMYK space, but we surrender the flexibility of converting to the optimal CMYK space at
final output. For final stage or late-binding conversion, we are dependent on the RIP environment for managing the
calculations between the profile pair (see Section 5.2). A device link provides additional security in the conversion
process by reducing the variability that can come with the processing application input that is part of a profile pair
transformation.

4.9 A Review of the Profile Classes
Alan Martin

We’ve now touched on the four types or classes of profiles: display, input, output, and device link. What traits do they
have in common? They are:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Specified by ICC-defined file formats
Contain colour tables
Have device colour values associated with device independent colour values (PCS)
Use a measuring device (spectrophotometer) and targets for creation
Require a specified rendering intent
Have standard OS library locations

There are also some unique characteristics for each profile class that help define the role they play in the overall colour
management process. The display class of profiles:
• Have no separate, tangible target: the device ‘is’ the target
• Can affect device behaviour
• Are mostly integrated with device calibration
The input class of profiles:
• Are unidirectional: A to B table only (device values to PCS)
• Are able to exclude any external measuring (with a supplied TDF)
• Ensure that the target’s job is tell us how the device ‘sees’ the target
Output (and device link) class of profiles:
•
•
•
•
•

Use CMYK (versus RGB for display and input)
Have black handling settings
Have the largest and most complex colour tables
Ensure the target’s job is to tell us how the device ‘makes’ the target
Provides preview capability for upstream editing

We also discussed the functions of a profile in the colour equation. The two functions are source and destination. A
source profile is a profile used to convert device dependent RGB or CMYK information to a device independent colour
space (Lab). A destination profile is a profile used to convert information from a device independent colour space (Lab)
into a device dependent colour space of an output device (RGB or CMYK). You can think of the source profile as the
colour reference or the place from which our desired colour appearance comes. The destination profile describes the
location where we are producing colour in the current pairing of devices. If we want a proofer to simulate the colour
behaviour of a particular press, the press’s profile is the source (the desired colour behaviour) and the profile for the
proofer is the destination (our colour output).

103

104 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

Do not confuse a profile’s class with its function; they are independent and separate characteristics. A particular
output profile can assume the function of source in one colour equation and then turn around and assume the role of
destination in a second. Take the example of the press above, where the press profile acted as the source. If we have
multiple presses in the printing plant, and we have another press that is our master press for colour behaviour, the press
profile that acted as a source for the proofer output will now function as a destination profile to align that press to the
colour behaviour of the master press (the master press profile is the source profile in this pairing).
Profiles enable the two key processes of any colour managed workflow: clear communication of colour meaning and
the transformation of device values to maintain colour appearance.

4.10 The Components and Purpose of a Colour Management System
Alan Martin

Our primary goal in colour management is to provide a consistent perceptual experience. As we move from device to
device, within the limits of the individual device’s colour gamut, our interpretation of the colour event should be the
same.
As we’ve discussed, but it’s worth repeating, we achieve that goal in two fundamental steps:
1. We give colour its meaning through device independent colour values correlated to a specific device’s RGB
or CMYK numbers.
2. We transform our destination device’s specific values to match the perceived colour definitions of our
source.
The Components
We have spoken at great length about colour profiles, but there are three additional pieces required to enact a colourmanaged workflow: the profile connection space (PCS), a colour management module (CMM), and rendering intents.
The PCS provides the device independent colour definitions to which device values can be matched. The ICC
specification allows the XYZ or Lab colour spaces for the PCS.
Profiles provide the look up table for the conversion of device values to PCS and vice versa. Any conversion requires
two profiles (or a device link into which two profiles have been merged).
The CMM is the software engine that actually does the conversion. It lives in a product like Adobe Photoshop or Kodak
Prinergy, where file processing takes place. The CMM provides two major benefits: it reduces profile size by doing the
interpolation in colour calculations and compensates for shortcomings in the Lab colour space. The CMM does the
heavy lifting by providing the computation of the conversion. For consistency, it is best to keep to a common CMM as
much as possible. The Adobe Color Engine or ACE is the CMM seen referenced in the Color Setup dialog window of
the Adobe Creative products.
Rendering intents are the instructions for dealing with out-of-gamut colours (see Figure 4.10). They are user-selectable
controls to define colour rendition when you move colour from one device to another. There are four types of rendering
intents: perceptual, saturation, relative colorimetric, and absolute colorimetric. Each intent represents a different colour
conversion compromise, resulting in a different gamut mapping style.
Perceptual and saturation intents use gamut compression, where the overall gamut space is adjusted. Relative and
absolute colorimetric intents use gamut clipping, where colour matching is maintained throughout the available gamut,
and out-of-gamut colours are moved to the available extremes of the destination gamut.
The perceptual intent is used mainly for RGB to CMYK transformations, which are typically image conversions. Since
we are moving from a larger gamut (RGB) to a smaller gamut (CMYK), it makes sense to employ a rendering intent that
preserves the overall relationship rather than one that emphasizes one-to-one colour matching within the gamut.

105

106 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

Figure 4.10

The saturation intent is the least relevant for colour-managed workflows. When you use this intent, colour saturation is
preserved as much as possible at the expense of hue and luminance. The result is a bad colour match, but the vividness
of pure colours is preserved. This intent is usually used for documents such as presentations, charts, and diagrams, but
not for graphic arts jobs.
The two colorimetric intents, relative and absolute, are closely related. They are both used for CMYK to CMYK
conversions where the gamuts of source and destination are closely matched or the destination is larger (typical of a
proofer compared to the press it is matching). They emphasize exact colour matching for in-gamut colours and clip outof-gamut colours.
The only difference between the two colorimetric rendering intents is in white point handling. The absolute intent pays
attention to the colour of white in the source and reproduces that in the destination. Think of newspaper printing where
the whitest colour is the paper that has a dull and beige tone. With an absolute rendering intent, a proofer matching the
newspaper would add that beige colour to all of the white areas of the proof. This matching of white destination to white
source colour is not usually necessary due to the chromatic adaptation or colour constancy that we discussed earlier. We
have a built-in mechanism for adjusting to judge the overall colour relationship independent of the appearance of white.
For this reason, the relative colorimetric intent is used most of the time and the white of the destination is not adjusted
to simulate the white point of the source.
With all of the pieces of the colour management process clearly delineated, we can put them to use in our standard
graphic arts workflow applications.

4.11 Applying Colour Management in the Adobe Creative and Kodak Prinergy
Software
Alan Martin

Colour management comes into play at two primary points in the print production workflow: during file creation
with authoring tools like the Adobe Creative applications (Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator), and then when the file is
processed for output with a workflow software program such as Kodak Prinergy. Let’s examine the details in these most
widely used software tools to provide concrete examples.
Colour Set-up in the Adobe Creative Applications
The primary tool for colour management in the Adobe products is the Color Settings dialog under the Edit menu.
Fortunately, these settings can be shared across all of the Adobe applications to coordinate a consistent delivery of
colour strategy. Define your settings in Photoshop, as this is the application with the largest number of options, to
guarantee that all possible options have been set to your choices.
Launch Photoshop and, from the Edit menu, choose Color Settings. There are three main sections to the dialog window:
Working Spaces, Color Management Policies, and Conversion Options. Change the Settings option above the Working
Spaces panel to North American Prepress 2. This applies a set of defaults that are optimal for a print production
workflow.
Working Spaces is Adobe’s name for default profiles. These are the profiles that will be used if no other information is
available. If you open a file that is untagged (the terminology for a document that has no profile attached to it), the profile
listed for the colour space matching the file will be assumed and used as long as the file is open. It will not persist with
the file once the file is closed. If you create a new file in the application, the profile listed will be assigned and the profile
reference will move forward with the file.
Let’s review and clarify the terminology associated with describing the status of a colour profile relative to a particular
document or file. A file that has a profile is referred to as tagged while one without profile is untagged. A tagged document
can have one of two relationships with its colour profile. The colour profile can be embedded or assigned. An embedded
profile is actually written into the file content. This increases the file size, but guarantees that the desired profile will
be available. For an assigned profile, only a reference to the profile is contained in the document. File size is reduced,
but access to the profile depends on the application and environment processing the object. You can think of an assumed
profile as a temporary assignment that will only last as long as the file is open.
For Working Spaces options, the RGB default of Adobe RGB (1998) that comes with the North American Prepress 2
setting is a perceptually even RGB space, which makes it better for editing and a good choice. The CMYK field is where
you should choose a profile specific to the final output device if it is known. The SWOP profile is a reasonable fallback
and is commonly used as the industry standard for generic work. Be aware that choosing SWOP will constrain the
gamut to the capability of a web offset print condition.
The list of profiles available for selection comes from the various ColorSync aware folders that we have previously
discussed. Priority is given to profiles in the Library/Application Support/Adobe/Color/ Profiles/Recommended

107

108 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

folder, and these profiles are listed first. If you have a profile that you wish to give prominence to for selection, place it
in this folder.
The Color Management Policies subsection controls behaviour when opening or creating documents and when moving
objects between documents. There are three options for each of the available colour space settings: Off, Preserve
Embedded, or Convert to Working.
The choice of Off is the most misleading, because we can’t actually turn colour management off: there is always an
assumed profile if no other information is presented. With Off, copy and paste of an object moves tint values: a 50% cyan
value from the originating document lands as 50% cyan in the destination document.
Preserve Embedded does what it says and maintains what’s in place. New documents use the Working Space profile and
become tagged. An untagged file assumes the working space profile but stays untagged. If you copy and paste native
RGB objects, they are converted. If you copy and paste native CMYK objects, the tint values are maintained.
Our final choice for colour management policy is potentially the most dangerous. Convert to Working converts tagged
documents using the existing profile as a source profile and the Working Space profile as the destination. If you do not
have the Alert check boxes ticked, this can happen without your awareness. For an untagged document, it assumes the
Working Space profile. Copy and pasting RGB or CMYK objects always converts to preserve appearance (changes the
tint values).
After reviewing the choices, the recommendation for Color Management Policies is Preserve Embedded, and make sure
all Alert boxes are checked. This allows you to confirm that any action is what you actually want before proceeding.
The last section of the Color Settings dialog window is the Conversion Options. The Engine option refers to the colour
management module (CMM) that will be used for calculations in the colour conversions. The default choice of the
Adobe Color Engine is good for maintaining consistency. Here we have as well the Rendering Intent entry, which will
function as a default unless an alternate intent is specified in any dialog. Relative Colorimetric is a reasonable choice
unless you know that almost all of your conversions will be RGB to CMYK for which Perceptual is the appropriate
intent option. Always check Use Black Point Compensation. This maps the black point source to the black point
destination, avoiding any clipping or flattening of the darkest colours and maintains the full dynamic range.
Now that we have all of our working parameters correctly defined, we can OK the Color Settings dialog and look at the
basic mechanism for using colour profiles in the Adobe Creative applications. There are two actions we can invoke from
the Edit menu to apply colour profiles: Assign Profile and Convert to Profile.
Assign Profile allows us to select a source profile for the open document. This action will replace the existing profile for
a tagged document or provide a new reference for an untagged file. To have the association persist, you must save the
file and check the option to embed the current colour profile. Assigning a profile will change the onscreen appearance
of the file but not alter any of the file’s tint values (colour data). We are simply instructing the computer on how the
original CMYK or RGB values would look if they are coming from our new source (described in the look up table of the
new colour profile).
Convert to Profile is an immediate and irreversible (once the file is saved) transformation of the document’s tint values.
The assigned profile is used as a source and the user selects a destination profile and rendering intent. The conversion
takes place and the file now has new RGB or CMYK numbers as a result. If you use the advanced dialog to specify
a device link profile, then the currently assigned source profile is ignored for the calculations since the device link
contains information for both the source and destination conditions.
Both the Assign and Convert dialog windows come with a Preview check box that will allow you to toggle between the

4.11 APPLYING COLOUR MANAGEMENT IN THE ADOBE CREATIVE AND KODAK PRINERGY SOFTWARE • 109

before and after state to visually validate your choices and experiment with the effects of choosing different rendering
intents.
Assessing the Effect of a Colour Profile
Once the profile is applied, what should we be looking for? Both on screen and when comparing hard-copy (printed)
samples, there are specific areas of the image that should be checked. There is also industry-specific language used in
describing colour appearance that it is helpful to be familiar with. The areas of the image to pay special attention to are
saturated colours, flesh tones, neutrals, and the highlights. Proof and print sample sheets will have four or five images
that emphasize these areas along with tone ramps in the process and overprint colours. Focusing on these areas of
interest will make it easiest to identify variation when checking for colour matching.
The terminology that is often employed is colour cast, to indicate a shift toward a particular colour; heaviness, to suggest
excessive tone (particularly in the highlights); dirty, to specify too much complementary colour resulting in greying; and
flat, to describe a lack of contrast and/or saturation. Knowing the terminology will help you understand the comments
your co-workers may make and will help remind you of the types of analysis you should be doing.
Additional Colour Tools in Adobe Acrobat
In addition to the fundamental profile handling procedures described above, there are several powerful and useful
colour tools in Adobe Acrobat that can be used once you have exported your desktop file to a PDF. These are found
among the Print Production Tools in the Acrobat Tools menu. Two are of particular note: Convert Colors and Output
Preview.
Convert Colors allows you to convert colour spaces, such as changing RGB content to CMYK. It also enables
transforming spot colours (such as Pantone) to CMYK. In addition, if the file incorrectly contains multiple instances of
a spot colour that should all appear together on the same printing plate (i.e., Pantone 283 and special blue), they can be
linked to behave as a single entry on the colour palette.
Output Preview does not apply any changes to the file, but is an extraordinarily powerful review mechanism. It enables
you to confirm that colour elements in the file are as they should be before you commit to the expensive step of actual
output. With Output Preview, you can turn individual separations on and off to check overprints and knockouts; check
the separation list to confirm which elements are attached to each separation; identify the colour space of each object;
and even highlight any area that exceeds your threshold for total ink coverage.
Profile Use in Kodak Prinergy
The final topic in our exploration of colour management in graphic technologies is an example of the application of
colour management in a print production workflow. We’ll use one of the predominant workflow applications, Kodak
Prinergy, as a model.
The processing instructions for file handling in Prinergy are contained in a process template. Input files are ‘refined’ to
PDF in the Prinergy workflow and an important portion of the refining process is the instructions relating to colour
conversions. In addition, we have process templates for output both to proof and final output. These templates also
contain colour control options. For both refine and output process templates, the colour management information is
contained in the Match Colors box of the Color Convert subsection.
Prinergy offers a comprehensive colour management application of its own called ColorFlow. There is a check box

110 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

in Color Convert to turn on ColorFlow awareness and pass all of the colour management decisions to what has been
predefined in ColorFlow. Discussing the structure and functional logic of ColorFlow is beyond the scope of this text. To
use Prinergy as a more generic workflow example, we’ll uncheck the ColorFlow option and turn off the integration.
The standard location to store profiles for use by Prinergy is \Prinergy\ CreoAraxi\data\ICC-Profiles. Profiles are not
immediately available from this location in Prinergy’s drop-down menus, but can be browsed to if placed in job-specific
subfolders.
Let’s look at the Match Colors section of the refine process template. With ColorFlow integration turned off, the entry
fields under Assign Input Device Conditions become available. If you check Override Embedded Profiles, then profiles
that are checked on in the Assign Input Device Conditions section will replace all existing profiles in the files being
processed. Notice that there is a very granular level of control, with independent entries for CMYK images, CMYK
graphics, RGB images, and RGB graphics. If you specify a device link profile, it will override any tagged profile whether
or not Override Embedded Profiles is checked.
Convert to Destination is where you indicate the destination profile. This will only be used for instances not covered
by a device link in the assign section. Remember that any device link contains both source and destination information.
Beneath the Convert box is a box for selecting rendering intents. Entries are only available for the options that were
checked on under Assign Input Device Conditions. The default entry is Perceptual since most input files will require
image conversions from larger colour gamuts.
For output process templates in Prinergy, the options are very similar to what has been described above. We typically
use colour management for output to proofs, either single page or imposed. There is a separate ColorFlow section to
uncheck to enable the more traditional colour management approach. In the Match Colors box, Match Colors in Page
Content must be checked on for any colour profiles to be applied. Also, you must select one of the following radio
buttons–As Defined Below, If Not Set in Refining, or Exactly as Defined Below– so you will be able to choose a profile
in the Input Device Conditions box. Since all content will now be in the CMYK space from the refine process template,
there are no longer independent options for RGB, graphics and images: only one source or device link can be specified.
The rendering intent is entered in the Rendering Intent field. The destination profile (usually the proofer profile) goes
in the Device Condition box. Once again, this destination profile will be ignored if a device link has been chosen for the
source.
By following the steps described, the workflow application user can produce predictable and accurate colour
reproduction results through both the file processing and output steps of any print production workflow.

4.12 Summary
Alan Martin

In essence, colour management is a translation process. The tools and precepts of colour science give us the lexicon to
populate the dictionaries of each of the devices we use in our graphic technology workflow. Our device’s dictionary
is the colour profile we generate with the help of a colour target, an instrument to measure the target and colour
management software to process the measurements.
Since the device’s dictionary (colour profile) defines the specific RGB or CMYK values of that device in a device
independent colour language, we have a conduit between any two devices. By aligning the device independent values
between the two devices, we can translate from the device dependent values of our source to the new RGB or CMYK
values at our destination to provide a common colour experience.
With an understanding of how to configure our standard graphic arts applications to effectively use our device’s
profiles, we can make successful colour translations happen in our real-world production scenarios. Successful colour
translations provide the improved productivity that comes with predictability and confidence in process control.

North America’s fifth-largest manufacturing sector is graphic communications technologies. We can become aware of
just how huge this industry is by listing all the manufactured images we see in our day. Your list might include the
morning paper or magazine you read, the graphic on the side of the bus you ride to work, and the labels on the grocery
shelf where you select your evening meal. Increasingly, more of the graphics that are driving that massive industry are
produced with computer graphics software on personal computers. Most of the graphics software used to create the
images for reproduction is designed to create images for electronic media — primarily the Internet. Computer graphics
designers are not aware of, or concerned with, optimizing their designs for the manufacturing process they are driving.
This problem is a root cause of less profitability in most sectors of the graphic communications industry. To tackle this
problem, we must become aware of all that happens to a computer graphic from the time it leaves the picture created on
the computer screen to the image on the label on the package on the grocery shelf, or the photograph on the side of a
bus.
We must first distinguish between traditional pre-press technologies and the pre-imaging processes that are relevant
in today’s graphic communications industry. Pre-press processes are different from the way we process images for
electrophotographic imaging or imaging with an inkjet engine. We must also distinguish between preparing images for
a lithographic press and a flexographic press. Electrophotography and inkjet are growing technologies used to produce
customized — or individualized — communications materials. Lithography and flexography are used to manufacture
mass-produced media products. These four imaging processes are the core imaging technologies that reproduce 90% of
the images produced in the graphic communications industry.

5.1 INTRODUCTION • 115

Many graphic designers are not aware of what must happen to the computer graphics they produce in order to ready
them for manufacturing reproduction. Their experience is limited to hitting ‘command P’ and their computer graphic
magically transforming the illuminated masterpiece on their Apple Cinema Display, to the disappointing rendition that
appears on the tray of their inkjet printer. Most of the pre-imaging processes are automated in software functions that
are built into the print driver, so people are not aware of how a computer graphic must be prepared for an imaging
device. Since more and more of the images produced through inkjet, electrophotography, lithography and flexography
start their lives as computer graphics, it is important to understand these pre-imaging processes to properly design
computer graphics for the manufacturing process.
This chapter will analyze six pre-imaging processes in detail, and describe how they are altered to prepare computer
graphics differently for each of the four imaging technologies. We will refer back to the computer graphic design/
creation process to outline how graphics could be altered so they can be more effectively reproduced with each imaging
technology. This is the missing link in the graphic communications business in today’s marketplace. Designers create
computer graphics in software that is increasingly designed for electronic image creation. They do not realize that the
same graphic they created for a home page on the Internet should not be used for the cover of a book. They email the
image to a lithographic print production facility and the pre-press department of that facility does hand springs trying to
alter the image to work on their sheet-fed presses. This adds time and cost to the job that is usually buried. The designer
never gets feedback on how the design could be altered to be more effective for lithographic production.
When pre-press was a computer-to-film process, there were two important factors that ensured designers got this
critical feedback. The software for computer graphic production was specialized for print creation and content could be
photographed or computer-generated and combined on film. Computer graphic designers knew their image was only
going to be used for the cover of a book and created it appropriately. They also had to submit their computer graphic to
a graphic communications production facility that was separate from the lithographic print facility. If there were extra
costs incurred to prepare the computer graphic for a lithographic press, the designer was informed and invoiced for the
extra work the image preparation entailed. So the designers were working with computer graphic software that would
not let them create imagery that was not appropriate for print production, and if they did dream up an image that did
not work well, they were immediately informed of the extra costs they were incurring.
In the 21st-century marketplace, all graphics that drive our four primary imaging technologies are created on the
computer. Computer graphics software is designed to create effects for images that will stay in the electronic media:
web, broadcast, digital film, and hand-held communication technologies. Pre-imaging processes are either automated
or a part of the print manufacturing business and usually considered the painful part of feeding the print machinery
that no one wants to talk about. So computer graphic designers drive software that lets them create outrageous
images for imaging reproduction manufacture. They are less concerned about the ‘print’ part of a media campaign, and
manufacturers are hesitant to inform them that their designs incurred extra costs to reproduce. We can contribute to a
solution to this problem by analyzing all of the pre-imaging processes for each type of reproduction manufacture and
link them back to the computer graphic design software.
We will examine six pre-imaging processes:

Raster image processing (RIP) technologies that are common to all four manufacturing processes
Colour management for repeatability, as a part of the RIP process
Trapping to lithographic and flexographic specifications
Transparency, which is a visual effect that has a great impact on imaging
Imposition for pre-RIP and post-RIP for media utilization
Preflight analysis and automation for computer file creation

5.2 Raster Image Processing
Wayne Collins

The raster image processor (RIP) is the core technology that does the computational work to convert the broad range
of data we use to create a computer graphic into the one-bit data that drives a physical imaging device. Let’s examine
the creation of a single character of the alphabet, or glyph. A font file delivers PostScript language to the RIP that
describes a series of points and vector curves between those points to outline the letter A. The RIP has a matrix grid
at the resolution of the output device and computes which spots on the grid get turned on and which are turned off to
create the shape of that letter A on the output device. The spots on the grid can only be turned on or off — which is how
binary data is encoded — either as 0 or 1. The grid then acts as a switch to turn a mechanical part of the imaging engine
on or off.
With computer-to-plate technology for lithographic printing plate production, a laser is used to expose an emulsion
on a printing plate. Most plate-setters have a resolution of 2,000 to 3,000 lspi (laser spots per inch). The RIP calculates
all the spots that must be turned ‘on’ to create the graphic that will be imaged on the printing plate. If the image fills a
typical sheet-fed press, it is (30 inches x 3,000 lspi) x (40 inches x 3,000 lspi) = 1.08 trillion, which takes 10 gigabytes of
computer memory to store and transfer. A printing plate for flexographic print production is created by turning a laser
on and off at a slightly lower resolution. An inkjet printer uses the same RIP process to deliver the same one-bit data to
each inkjet nozzle for each colour of ink in the printer. Most inkjet engines have a resolution between 600 and 1,200
spots per inch — so the matrix grid is smaller — but if it is an eight-colour printer, the data for all eight nozzles must
be synchronized and delivered simultaneously. An electophotographic (Xerox) printer usually has a resolution similar
to an inkjet printer and utilizes a similar RIP process to change a grid of electrostatic charges to positive or negative on
an electrostatic drum that is the maximum media size the machine can image. Each colour in the printer has a separate
raster image that charges the drum in the right spot to attract that colour of toner to that exact location. The data for
each colour must be synchronized for simultaneous delivery. The data must refresh the charge on the drum after each
print in order to pick up new toner. That is a very important fact to remember when we talk about personalizing print
with variable data later in this chapter.
This basic understanding of RIP’s place in a computer graphic workflow is essential to understanding how to prepare
files for, and manage, RIP resources. It is also essential in solving some of the common problems we see in various RIPs.
When we compare the two mass production imaging technologies, lithography and flexography, to the personalized
imaging technologies, electrophotography and inkjet, we can identify some core similarities. In lithography and
flexography, a high-powered laser is used to alter a physical emulsion that is durable and finely grained enough to let
the laser image a spot that is one three-thousandth of an inch without affecting the spot of equal size beside it. We can
reliably image that spot in a serif of a glyph set in one point type or a hair on a face in a photo that is imaged with a
5 micron frequency modulated (FM) screening pattern. The mass production technology assures us that the first print
will be identical to the millionth print.
The raster grid of one-bit data that the RIP produces must be delivered to the imaging drum or the inkjet nozzle for
every image that is produced with an inkjet printer or an electrophotographic engine. This is what allows us to make
every image different and personalize it for the person we are delivering the image to. It also makes the process slower
and less reliable for mass production. The RIP produces a lower resolution raster grid, so the detail in photos and letter
shapes is not as precise. We can have a RIP discard data if we have too much detail for the raster grid it is producing. The

116

5.2 RASTER IMAGE PROCESSING • 117

RIP does not do a good job of interpolating more data to produce additional detail in a photo or graphic shape if that
information is missing to begin with.
That brings us to examining the resources that a RIP must have to produce a perfect raster for every graphic shape it
renders, and for every colour being reproduced. The resource a RIP consumes is data. In the graphic communications
industry, we should all wear T-shirts that say ‘Pigs for data!’ just to distinguish us from our media colleagues who are
producing computer graphics for electronic media. If we think of a RIP as an auto assembly line we are feeding with
parts, in the form of files in different data formats, it will help us understand how to make a RIP more efficient. If we
feed too many parts into the assembly line, it is easier to throw some parts away than it is to stop and recreate a part that
is missing. If we feed the assembly line with five times as many parts needed to make a car, it is still more efficient to
throw parts away than it is to stop and recreate a missing part.
If we apply this analogy to image resolution, we can point to examples where designers regularly repurpose images from
a web page to use on a book cover or poster print. The web page needs to deliver the photo across a network quickly and
only needs to fill a typical computer screen with enough detail to represent the photo. A typical photo resolution to do
that properly is 72 pixels per inch. Now remember that the raster grid for a lithographic printing press that will print the
book cover is 3,000 lspi. Our RIP needs much more data than the web page image contains! Most of the photos we are
reproducing today are captured with electronic devices — digital cameras, phones, scanners, or hand-held devices. Most
store the data with some kind of compression to reduce the data the device has to store and transfer. Those efficiencies
stop at the RIP though, as this computational engine has to decompress the data before applying it to the graphic page
it is rasterizing. It is like breaking a steering wheel down to wires, bolts, and plastic sleeves that efficiently fit into a
one-inch-square shipping package, and putting this ‘IKEA furniture’ steering wheel onto an auto production line for the
assembler to deal with in two-point-two minutes!
On the other hand, we can capture a digital photo at 6,000 pixels per inch (ppi) and use it on a page scaled to half
the original dimension. That is like packing a finished steering wheel in 10 yards of bubble wrap and setting it on the
assembly line in a wooden shipping crate! So it is important for designers to pay attention to the resolution of the final
imaging device to determine the resolution that the RIP will produce from the graphic files it is processing.
Halftone Screening
It is important to stop here for a discussion about halftone screening that a RIP applies to photographs and graphics to
represent grey levels or tonal values in a graphic element. We described how the RIP makes a grid of one-bit data, but
graphics are not just black and white — they have tonal values from 0% (nothing) printing to 100% (solid) printing. If we
want to render the tonal values in-between in half percent increments, we need 200 addresses to record the different
values. Computer data is recorded in bits, two values (on and off), and bytes, which are eight bits strung together in one
switch. The number of values a byte can record is 256 — the number of combinations of on and off that the eight bits
in the byte can express. A computer records a byte of data for each primary colour (red, green, and blue — RGB) for
each detail in a photo, as a pixel (picture element), which controls the phosphors on electronic imaging devices. A RIP
must convert the eight-bit RGB values into the four primary printing ink colours (cyan magenta, yellow, and black —
CMYK). There are two distinct steps here: (1) conversion from RGB to CMYK continuous tone data (24 bit RGB to 32
bit CMYK); and (2) continuous tone to one-bit screening algorithms. We have to be in the output colour space before we
can apply the one-bit conversion. It converts the eight-bit tonal values into one-bit data by dividing the area into cells
that can render different sizes and shapes of dots by turning spots on and off in the cell. A cell with a grid that is 10 laser
spots wide by 10 laser spots deep can render different 100 dot sizes (10 x 10), from 1% to 99%, by turning on more and
more of the laser spots to print. If we think back to the plate-setter for lithographic platemaking, we know it is capable
of firing the laser 2,000 to 3,000 times per inch. If the cells making up our printing dots are 10 spots square, we can make
dot sizes that have a resolution of 200 to 300 halftone screened dots in one inch. A RIP has screening (dot cell creation)

118 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

algorithms that convert the data delivered in RGB pixels at 300 pixels per inch into clusters of laser spots (dots) for each
printing primary colour (CMYK).
This description of how a RIP processes photographic data from a digital camera can help us understand why it is
important to capture and deliver enough resolution to the RIP. It must develop a detailed representation of the photo in
a halftone screened dot that utilizes all of the laser spots available. The basic rule is: Required PPI = 2 x lines per inch
(LPI) at final size. So if you need to print something at 175 lines per inch, it must have a resolution of 350 pixels per
inch at the final scaled size of the reproduction. Use this rule if you are not given explicit direction by your print service
provider. You can use a default of 400 ppi for FM screening where lpi is not relevant.
WYSIWYG
It is important to know that each time we view a computer graphic on our computer screen, it is imaging the screen
through a RIP process. The RIP can change from one software program to another. This is why some PDF files look
different when you open them in the Preview program supplied with an Apple operating system than they do when
opened in Adobe Acrobat. The graphics are being processed through two different RIPs. The same thing can happen
when the image is processed through two different printers. The challenge is to consistently predict what the printed
image will look like by viewing it on the computer screen. We use the acronym WYSIWYG (what you see is what you
get) to refer to imagery that will reproduce consistently on any output device. Designers have faced three significant
challenges in trying to achieve WYSISYG since the advent of desktop publishing in the early 1980s.
The first challenge was imaging typography with PostScript fonts. The second was colour managing computer screens
and output devices with ICC profiles. The third and current challenge is in imaging transparent effects predictably from
one output device to another. Font problems are still the most common cause of error in processing client documents
for all imaging technologies. Let’s look at that problem in depth before addressing the other two challenges in achieving
WYSIWYG.
Font Management
The development of the PostScript computer language was pioneered by Adobe in creating the first device independent
font files. This invention let consumers typeset their own documents on personal computers and image their documents
on laser printers at various resolutions. To achieve WYSIWYG on personal computer screens, the font files needed two
parts: screen fonts and printer fonts. Screen fonts were bitmaps that imaged the letter shapes (glyphs) on the computer
screen. Printer fonts were vector descriptions, written in PostScript code, that had to be processed by a RIP at the
resolution of the printer. The glyphs looked significantly different when imaged on a 100 dpi laser printer than they
did on a 600 dpi printer, and both were quite different from what graphic artists/typographers saw on their computer
screen. That was not surprising since the shapes were imaged by completely different computer files — one raster, one
vector — through different RIP processors, on very different devices. Many graphic designers still do not realize that
when they use Adobe type font architecture they must provide both the raster screen font and the vector PostScript
font to another computer if they want the document that utilizes that font to process through the RIP properly. This
was such a common problem with the first users of Adobe fonts that Microsoft made it the first problem they solved
when developing TrueType font architecture to compete with Adobe fonts. TrueType fonts still contained bitmap data
to draw the glyphs on a computer screen, and PostScript vector data to deliver to a RIP on a print engine. The TrueType
font file is a single file, though, that contains both raster and vector data. TrueType fonts became widely distributed with
all Microsoft software. Microsoft also shared the specifications for TrueType font architecture so users could create
and distribute their own fonts. The problems with the keeping screen font files with printer font files went away when
graphics creators used TrueType fonts.
The quality of the fonts took a nose dive as more people developed and distributed their own font files, with no

5.2 RASTER IMAGE PROCESSING • 119

knowledge of what makes a good font, and what can create havoc in a RIP. Today, there are thousands of free TrueType
fonts available for downloading from a multitude of websites. So how does a designer identify a good font from a bad
font? The easiest way is to set some complicated glyphs in a program like Adobe InDesign or Illustrator and use a
‘convert to outlines’ function in the program. This will show the nodes and bezier curves that create the glyph. If there
are many nodes with small, straight line segments between them, the font may cause problems in a RIP. Remember that
PostScript was meant to be a scalable device independent programming language. If the poorly made glyphs are scaled
too small, the RIP has to calculate too many points from the node positions and ends up eliminating many points that
are finer than the resolution of the raster image. On the other hand, if the glyph is scaled too large, the straight lines
between points make the smooth curve shapes square and chopped-looking. These fonts are usually created by hand
drawing the letter shapes, scanning the drawings, and auto tracing them in a program like Illustrator. The ‘convert to
outlines’ test reveals the auto tracing right away, and it is a good idea to search out another font for a similar typeface
from a more reputable font foundry.
Another good test is to look at the kerning values that are programmed into the font file. Kerning pairs are glyph shapes
that need the space between them tightened up (decreased) when they appear together. A good font usually has 600 to
800 kerning pair values programmed into its file. The most common pair that needs kerning is an upper case ‘T’ paired
with a lower case ‘o’ (To). The ‘o’ glyph must be tucked under the crossbar of the T, which is done by programming a
negative letter space in the font file to have less escapement when the imaging engine moves from rendering the first
shape to when it starts imaging the second shape. If we set the letter pair, and put the curser in the space between them,
a negative kerning value should appear in the kerning tool. If no kerning value appears, the font is usually a poor one
and will cause spacing problems in the document it is used in.
Another common problem occurred when combining Adobe Type 1 fonts with TrueType fonts in the same document.
Adobe was the creator of the PostScript programming language, and although it was easy enough to copy its code and
create similar fonts, Adobe has maintained fairly tight control over licensing the PostScript interpreting engines that
determine how the PostScript code is rendered through a raster image processor. The RIP stores the glyph shapes in a
font file in a matrix that can be speedily accessed when rendering the glyphs. Each glyph is assigned an address in the
matrix, and each font matrix has a unique number assigned to it so that the RIP can assign a unique rendering matrix.
Adobe could keep track of its own font identification numbers but could not control the font IDs that were assigned
to TrueType fonts. If a TrueType font had the same font ID number as the Adobe Type 1 font used in a document, the
RIP would establish the glyph matrix from the first font it processed and use the same matrix for the other font. So
documents were rendered with one font instead of two, and the glyphs, word spacing, line endings, and page breaks
were all affected and rendered incorrectly. For the most part, this problem has been sorted out with the creation of a
central registry for font ID numbers; however, there are still older TrueType font files out there in the Internet universe
that will generate font ID conflicts in a RIP.
Adobe, Apple, and Microsoft all continued to compete for control of the desktop publishing market by trying to
improve font architectures, and, as a result, many confusing systems evolved and were discarded when they caused
more problems in the RIPs than they solved. There is a common font error that still causes problems when designers
use Adobe Type 1 fonts or TrueType fonts. Most of these fonts only have eight-bit addressing and so can only contain
256 glyphs. A separate font file is needed to set a bold or italic version of the typeface. Some page layout programs will
allow the designer to apply bold or italic attributes to the glyphs, and artificially render the bold or italic shapes in the
document on the computer screen. When the document is processed in the RIP, if the font that contains the bold or italic
glyphs is not present, the RIP either does not apply the attribute, or substitutes a default font (usually Courier) to alert
proofreaders that there is a font error in the document. The line endings and page breaks are affected by the error —
and the printing plate, signage, or printout generated becomes garbage at great expense to the industry.
To solve this problem, Adobe actually cooperated with Microsoft and Apple in the development of a new font
architecture. OpenType fonts have unicode addressing, which allows them to contain thousands of glyphs. Entire

120 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

typeface families can be linked together to let designers seamlessly apply multiple attributes such as condensed bold
italic to the typeface, and have the RIP process the document very closely to what typesetters see on their computer
screen. PostScript is also the internal language of most page layout software, so the same OpenType font files are used
to rasterize the glyphs to screen as the printer’s RIP is using to generate the final output. There can be significant
differences in the RIP software, but many font issues are solved by using OpenType fonts for document creation.
One common font error still persists in the graphic communications industry that acutely underlines the difference
between creating a document on a single user’s computer but processing it through an imaging manufacturer’s
workstation. Designers usually own a specific set of fonts that they use for all the documents they create. The
manufacturer tries to use the exact font file each designer supplies with the document. The problem once again
involves the font ID number, as each font file activated in an operating system is cached in RAM memory to make
the RIP-to-screen process faster. So the font files the manufacturer receives can be different versions of the same font
created at different times, but assigned the same font ID number. For example, one designer uses a 1995 version of
Adobe’s Helvetica typeface and another uses a 2015 version, but the two typefaces have the same font ID number. The
manufacturer’s operating system will not overwrite the first font matrix it cached in RAM, so it is the first font file that
renders the document on screen and will be sent down to the RIP. Usually, there are few noticeable changes in the glyph
shapes. But it is common for font foundries to adjust kerning values between letter pairs from one version to the next. So
if a manufacturer has the wrong version of the font file cached in RAM, a document can have line-ending changes and
page reflows. This is a hard error to catch. There are programs and routines the imaging manufacturer can implement
to clear the RAM cache, but many times, more ‘garbage’ is generated before the problem is diagnosed. Modern PDF
creation usually includes the production of a uniquely tagged font subset package that only contains the glyphs used in
the document. The unique font subset ID avoids the potential for font ID conflicts.
Managing fonts on a single user computer has its own challenges, and Apple has included Font Book with its operating
systems to help manage fonts in applications on an Apple OS. Adobe offers Typekit with its latest Creative Cloud
software to provide greater access to a wide variety of typefaces from a reliable foundry. Third-party font management
programs like Suitcase Fusion also help graphic artists manage their fonts for repurposing their documents effectively.
It is still the responsibility of individual operators to know how to use the fonts in their documents. They should also
make sure that the fonts are licensed and packaged to deliver to other computer systems so that they can drive many
different RIPs on a wide variety of output devices.

5.3 Colour
Wayne Collins

The second challenge with implementing WYSIWYG for electronic documents that are imaged on substrates is
managing colour expectations. Chapter 4 discussed the challenges of colour management from the perspective of
how we see colour, measure it, and manage output devices with ICC profiles. In this chapter, we will explore colour
management from the perspective of how we recognize and manage the ICC profiles that are embedded in client
documents. We will also explore the preflight issues in managing spot colours in documents. This will also lead us to a
discussion of trapping for lithography and flexography.
To design with colour in computer graphics software, we must understand how the software generates the colour values.
Page layout and illustration software usually have several systems for creating colour on a page. The colour settings or
colour preferences attached to a file can change from one document to another or in the same document restored from
one computer to another. If a designer uses the RGB colour model to specify the colours in a document, the colours
on the monitor can change depending on the translations done to the colour settings. This is a major turning point for
designers creating documents intended to stay in the electronic media. No one pays much attention to how a particular
colour of red is rendered from one web browser to another. Designers pay more attention to how the colours interact
relative to one another in web-page documents. It is only when we image a computer graphic on a substrate that we
must pay attention to rendering the exact hue of red from one device to another. Coca-Cola has very exact specifications
for the red used in its documents that tie into its brand recognition. So designers for documents intended for imaging on
substrates must use colour models that are proven to render exactly the same results from one output device to another.
Pantone Colours
This is a lofty ideal that the graphic communications industry aspires to. There are systems in place that are proven to
render very accurate results. There are challenges in understanding the systems, and one wrong step in the process and
accuracy is destroyed. The process starts with how a designer chooses colours in a document. The most-used system for
choosing accurate colours was created by the Pantone company. Pantone has developed a library of ink recipes that are
published as swatch books. A designer can buy a printed book of a library of colours that matches an electronic library
that can be imported into computer software programs. Designers compare their on-screen rendering of a colour to the
printed sample swatch. If a designer is developing a corporate identification package with logos that use Pantone 123
and Pantone 456, the designer can be assured that the documents he or she creates will be imaged with inks that have
similar spectral values to the swatch books used to choose the colour. I say similar, because the swatch books fade over
time, and the substrates the books are printed on don’t usually match all the substrates a corporate logo is imaged on.
It is also important to realize that the Pantone library was created to mix pigments for spot colour inks rather than
process colour inks. Spot colours are mixed independently and must each be applied to the substrate independently.
Process inks are only the four primary colours: cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. Process inks are transparent and
are intended to be combined by halftone screening different percentages on a substrate to render any colour in the
Pantone library. Spot colour inks are more opaque and are intended to be applied to a substrate one at a time, through
distinctly separate printing units. Since most colour photography is colour separated to render the photo in only the
four primary process inks, most documents are created intending to convert the spot colours to process colours. They
can be imaged with the photographs in the document. A designer must know how many colours the output device is

121

122 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

capable of when deciding which colours will remain as spot colours and which will be converted to CMYK process
colours. Most inkjet and electrophotographic devices are only capable of imaging with the four process colours. Some
lithographic presses have extra printing units that can print spot colours, so six- and eight-colour presses commonly
print the four process colours and two (or four) extra spot colours in one pass. It is not uncommon to have 10- and
12-colour flexographic presses that image no process colours but use 12 spot colours. This is because, historically,
flexo plates cannot consistently reproduce very fine halftone dots reliably. This is changing with the development of
high-definition plating technology, so we are seeing more photographic content produced well on flexographic presses.
Flexography is primarily used in the packaging industry where spot colours are very closely tied to brand recognition
in retail outlets. A designer must be very aware of the imaging technology used to reproduce a document when deciding
which colours will remain spot colours.
This is where the next round of challenges begins when preflighting (assessing) documents for imaging to substrates.
If design elements stay as spot colours, it is a simple process to maintain the spot colour on the output device and to
image with the appropriate ink or toner. Some software will not maintain the spot colour in a document easily in some
situations. Usually, the problem comes with applying gradients to spot colours. It is very easy to introduce a median
colour value on a spot colour gradient that is simulated with a process colour value. The screen version displays a nice
smooth gradient that looks like what the designer intended to create. When imaging on a substrate, the gradient will
have to be broken down into individual colours: from the solid spot colour to a value of CMYK and back to spot colour.
It is very hard to recognize this by viewing the document, or even a composite PDF file. Viewing separated PDF files, or
using a ‘separations’ tool in Acrobat, will show the problem before it gets to a printing plate.
There are also colour problems associated with nested files generated in different software. For example, if we create a
magazine page with a headline colour named “PMS 123,” add a logo created in Adobe Illustrator with type in a colour
named “Pantone 123,” and insert a PDF ad created in Apple’s Pages layout with a border specifying “PANTONE 123,”
then even though they are all the same, colour-separating software will generate three separate spot colour plates for
that page. The spot colours have to be named exactly the same and come from the same library. Some modern workflows
include aliasing rules that will match numbered PMS colours to try to alleviate the problem. Colour libraries can be a
problem as well, especially if our software allows the library to convert the spot colour to a process colour. The same
colour library in two different versions of Adobe’s Creative Suite software can generate a different process colour recipe
for the same Pantone colour. This is not a problem if all the document elements are created within one software package
and all spot colours are converted to process colours. The problem arises when a designer places a graphic file from
other software on a page with the same colour elements. A logo created in an older version of Adobe Illustrator will
use that colour library to look up process colour recipes that can be very different from the recipes in a recent colour
library used in Adobe’s InDesign software. So all the Pantone orange colours in a document are supposed to look the
same, but do not because the spot colour to process colour conversion has not been done with the same library. The
problem becomes worse when we combine files from different software vendors, as designers often have to do when
building a document. It is common these days to bring together graphics created in Microsoft Office and Apple software
and generate a final document with Adobe InDesign. The best way to create consistent documents for reproduction is
to specify a common CMYK colour value that will print reliably on the output device.
Pantone also publishes a swatch book that shows the difference between the swatches run as spot colour ink mixes, and
the same swatch printed as halftone screen builds of process inks. This is a designer’s most valuable tool for specifying
process ink recipes. It also illustrates that many Pantone colours cannot be simulated very well using halftone screen
values of the four process inks. It is very apparent that very vibrant orange, purple, and green Pantone spot colours
are not achievable with process inks. There are systems like Hexachrome for colour separations that use more than
just CMYK inks to extend the gamut of the Pantone colours that can be reproduced. There are also more and more
inkjet and electrophotographic engines that will use extra spot colours to extend the colour range of the device beyond
CMYK. The businesses that employ those devices usually know they are unique in the marketplace and have developed
marketing tools to help designers use those capabilities successfully.

5.3 COLOUR • 123

Accuracy in Design
If we reflect back to the concept of WYSIWYG for a moment, we can use the Pantone selection process to illustrate
the challenge very well. If we ask a designer to choose colours for a document based on computer screen displays, we
know that the RGB or HSL values they can select will be far too vibrant for reproduction with any imaging engine. To
set proper expectations for WYSIWYG, we ask the designer to calibrate a monitor and select the proper output profiles
to tone down the screen view and set more realistic expectations. We also ask that a print designer use printed swatch
books to select from a library of specified colours and assign realistic CMYK process colour values to her or his colour
palette. If those steps are followed, there is a very reasonable chance that the process will achieve WYSIWYG. However,
it can break down in a few places. The spot colour swatch books set expectations about colours that cannot be achieved
with process inks. When a mixture of spot colours and process inks are used, it is difficult to display both on the same
computer screen with reliable colour. Graphics files can originate in different software with different libraries using
different process colour recipes for the same Pantone colours.
There are also many spot colour libraries to choose from, and designers don’t know when to use each library. We have
described why the Pantone library is a North American standard, and some of its limitations. There are other design
communities in the world that use spot colour libraries that are included as choices in graphic creation software tools.
There are almost as many spot colours to choose from as there are free fonts files to download from the Internet. Spot
colour classification has led to thousands of discrete colours being given unique names or numbers. There are several
industry standards in the classification of spot colour systems. These include:
•
•
•
•

Pantone, the dominant spot colour printing system used in North America and Europe.
Toyo, a spot colour system common in Japan.
DIC colour system guide, another spot colour system common in Japan.
ANPA, a palette of 300 colours specified by the American Newspaper Publishers Association for spot colour
usage in newspapers.
• GCMI, a standard for colour used in package printing developed by the Glass Packaging Institute (formerly
known as the Glass Container Manufacturers Institute, hence the abbreviation).
• HKS is a colour system that contains 120 spot colours and 3,250 tones for coated and uncoated paper. HKS is
an abbreviation of three German colour manufacturers: Hostmann-Steinberg Druckfarben, Kast + Ehinger
Druckfarben, and H. Schmincke & Co.
• RAL is a colour-matching system used in Europe. The RAL Classic system is mainly used for varnish and
powder coating.
The guiding principle for using any of these spot colour systems is to check that the manufacturer of the reproduction is
using that ink system. The Trumatch library is quickly gaining favour as a tool for colour selection. That library of spot
colours has been developed to be exactly replicated with process colour halftone screening. There are no spot colours
a designer can choose from that library that cannot be reproduced well with standard process inks. As more computer
graphics are being produced on digital imaging devices that only use CMYK, this colour library is becoming the choice
for cross-platform or multi-vendor media publications.

5.4 Trapping
Wayne Collins

Trapping can be a very complex procedure in pre-imaging software for certain imaging technologies. It is an electronic
file treatment that must be performed to help solve registration issues on certain kinds of press technologies. Generally,
if a substrate has to move from one colour unit to another in the imaging process, the registration of one colour to
another will not be perfect. That mis-registration must be compensated for by overlapping abutting colours. As soon as
two colours touch in any two graphic elements we must create a third graphic element that contains both colours and
overlaps the colours along the abutment line. That third element is called a trap line and can be generated many different
ways that we will review.
Electrophotography
First let’s look at the differences between the four most common imaging technologies and determine where and why
we need to generate these trap lines. Electrophotography, or toner-based digital printers, generally use only process
colours. Each time an electrostatic drum turns, it receives an electrical charge to attract the toner colour it is receiving.
The drum keeps turning until all colours of all toners are on the drum, and then all colours are transferred to the
substrate at one time. There is no chance for mis-registration between the cyan, magenta, yellow, and black toners as
they are imaged at the resolution of the raster generated by the RIP, and the placement of the electronic charge for each
colour can be adjusted until it is perfect, which makes it stable from image to image.
Lithography
Let’s compare electrophotography to the lithographic print process. In lithography, a printing plate is generated for each
colour and mounted on a plate cylinder. The plates are registered by manually turning wrenches to hold plate clamps, so
the plate-mounting procedure can generate registration errors. Each colour printing unit is loaded with a separate ink,
a plate that has been imaged to receive that ink, and a blanket that offsets the image from the plate before it transfers
it from the blanket to the substrate. This is another mechanical transfer point that can cause registration errors. Most
high-end lithographic presses have servo motors and cameras that work together to adjust for mechanical registration
errors as the press runs. The substrate must travel from one printing unit to the next, and it is here that most registration
errors occur. There are slight differences in the substrate thickness, stability, lead (or gripper) edge, and a different
rate of absorbing ink and water that cause slight mis-registration. Also, consider that most sheet-fed litho presses are
imaging around 10,000 sheets per hour, and we are only talking about movements of one-thousandth of an inch. On
most graphic pages, however, the naked eye can see a mis-registration of one-thousandth of an inch, so the process must
be compensated for. The solution is generating trap lines to a standard for lithography of three one-thousandths of an
inch. This trap line allowance in abutting colours allows for mis-registrations of two-thousandths of an inch that will
not show on the final page.
Inkjet
Inkjet is the next imaging technology we must assess and compare. The print heads on all inkjet machines are mounted
on the same unit travelling on the same track. Each ink is transferred one after the other and the substrate does not move

124

5.4 TRAPPING • 125

after receiving each colour. It is like electrophotography in that mis-registration between print heads can be adjusted
electronically, and once in register remain stable for multiple imaging runs on the same substrate. If the substrate is
changed between imaging, the operator must recalibrate to bring all colours into registration, and ensure the placement
of abutting colours is perfect and no compensation is needed. As a result, no trapping will be needed for most inkjet
imaging processes.
Flexography
Flexography is the fourth imaging technology we need to assess. This technology has the most points where misregistration can occur. The printed image must be raised on the plate to receive ink from an anilox roller that can deliver
a metered amount of ink. The computer graphic must be reduced (or flexed) in only one direction around the plate
cylinder. A separate printing plate is developed for each colour and mounted on a colour unit that includes an ink bath,
anilox roller, doctor blade, and a plate cylinder. The substrate travels from one print unit to the next on a continuous
web that is under variable amounts of tension. If a graphic has a lot of white space around it, the substrate can be pushed
into the blank space and cause distortion and instability in the shape and pressure of the raised inked image on the
substrate. Flexography is used to image the widest range of substrates, from plastic films to heavy corrugated cardboard.
This process absolutely needs trap lines generated between abutting colours. Standard traps for some kinds of presses
can be up to one point (1/72 of an inch, almost five times our standard litho trap). Graphic technicians need to pay
particular attention to the colour, size, and shape of the trap lines as much as to the graphic elements. In most packaging
manufacturing plants, there are pre-imaging operators that specialize in creating just the right trapping.
Let’s examine some of the ways these traps can be generated. The simplest way is for a graphic designer to recognize that
he or she is designing a logo for a package that will be imaged on a flexographic press that needs one-point trap lines
generated for all abutting colours. The designer isolates the graphic shapes that touch and creates overprinting strokes
on those graphic elements that contain all colours from both elements. That doesn’t even sound simple! (And it’s not.)
It becomes even more complicated when the graphic is scaled to many different sizes on the same package or used on
many different packages. So most designers do not pay attention to creating trap lines on the graphics they create and
leave it to the manufacturer to create trapping for the specific documents on the specific presses they will be reproduced
on.
There is specialized software that analyzes a document, determines where abutting colours are, and generates the tiny
graphic lines as a final layer on top of the original graphic. This is done before the document goes to the RIP so it
is raster-image processed at the same time as the rest of the document. Most RIPs process PDF files these days, and
there are specialized plug-ins for Adobe Acrobat that will analyze a document, generate trap lines, and let an operator
examine and edit the thicknesses, shape, and colour of those lines. It takes a skilled operator to examine the extra trap
lines and determine if they are appropriate for the press they are going to be printed on. Press operators also need to
determine the trap values of their inks. This refers to the ability of one printing ink to stick to another. Inks vary in
viscosity depending on the density and types of pigments they are carrying. The trap characteristics and transparency
of a printing ink are part of what determines the printing order in which they are applied to the substrate. For example,
a process primary yellow ink is very transparent and will not stick (trap) well if printed on top of a heavy silver metallic
ink. The metallic silver is thick and very opaque, so it will hide everything that it overprints. A graphics technician must
generate trap lines for a graphic that has metallic silver abutting to a process yellow shape. The technician will increase
(spread) the shape of the yellow graphic to go under the abutment to the silver. The silver shape will not be altered, and
when it overprints, the yellow ink will stick to and hide the yellow trap line shape. The best analogy, we have heard is
from a press person — the peanut butter sandwich analogy. We know the jelly sticks to the peanut butter and the peanut
butter will not stick to the bread if the jelly is spread first. If a press person does not know the trap values of the inks, he
or she can make as big a mess of the press sheet as an upside-down peanut butter and jelly sandwich makes on the front
of your shirt! For this reason, trapping should be left to the specialists and is usually applied to a final PDF file before
it is sent to a RIP. Ninety percent of trap lines for lithographic and flexographic imaging reproduction are generated

126 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

automatically by specialized trapping software. Operators are trained to recognize shapes and colour combinations that
will cause problems on the press. They will custom trap those documents with the Acrobat plug-ins we talked about
earlier.
Special Consideration for Black
There is one trapping combination that should be considered and applied to all four imaging technologies. It is the way
that black ink is handled in the document and applied on the imaging device. Most type is set in black ink, and much of
it overprints coloured backgrounds. In all four imaging technologies, black is the strongest ink and hides most of what it
overprints. It is still a transparent ink and most process black ink is more dark brown than the rich dark black we love to
see in our documents. If the size of the black type or graphic is large enough, we will be able to see the black colour shift
as it overprints stronger or weaker colours under it. Graphic designers should pay attention to setting whether black
type or graphics overprint the background, or knock out the background to print a consistent black colour. A useful rule
of thumb is that type above 18 points should be knocked out and boosted. Raise this threshold for very fine faces such
as a script where larger point sizes can overprint, and reduce it for excessively heavy fonts like a slab serif. If the graphic
is large enough, it should also be ‘boosted’ with other process colours.
The way we handle black ink or toner deserves special consideration in all four imaging technologies. Black is a
supplemental colour to the three primary process colours. It is intended to print only when the other three colours are
all present in some kind of balance. In all imaging technologies, we must watch that our total ink coverage does not
approach 400%, or 100% of each ink overprinting the other inks in the same place. This is usually too much ink or toner
for the substrate to absorb. As a result, it will not dry properly and will offset on the back of the next sheet, or bubble
and flake off the media in the fuser. Therefore, we must pay attention to how our photographs are colour separated, and
how we build black in our vector graphics.
Colour Separations
When colour separating photographs, we can build in an appropriate amount of GCR or UCR to give us the right total
ink coverage for the imaging technology we are using for reproduction. UCR stands for under colour removal. It is
applied to very dark shadow areas to remove equal amounts of cyan, magenta, and yellow (CMY) where they exceed the
total ink limit. For example, in sheet-fed lithography, a typical total ink limit is 360. In areas that print 100% of all
four colours, UCR will typically leave the full range black separation, and remove more and more CMY the deeper the
shadow colour is. A typical grey balance in shadows may be 95% cyan, 85% magenta, and 85% yellow. Including a 100%
black, that area would have a total ink coverage of 365. Other imaging technologies have different total ink limits, and
these can vary greatly from one substrate to another within an imaging technology. An uncoated sheet will absorb more
ink than a glossy coated sheet of paper and so will have a different total ink limit.
GCR stands for grey component replacement, and it is intended to help improve grey balance stability in a print run and
save on ink costs. GCR can affect far more colours than UCR as it can be set to replace equal amounts of CMY with black
all the way into the highlight greys. This is particularly useful in technologies like web offset newspaper production.
Grey balance is quickly achieved in the make-ready process and easily maintained through the print run. Black ink for
offset printing is significantly cheaper than the other process colours, so there are cost savings for long runs as well.
GCR is used in photos and vector graphics produced for other imaging technologies as well. Any process where grey
balance of equal values of the three primary colours could be an issue is a smart place to employ GCR.
You may be wondering how we can check the shadow areas of every photo we use. These GCR and UCR values can
be set in ICC profiles by linking the shadow and neutral Lab values to the appropriate CMYK recipes. When the ICC
profile is applied for a given output device, the shadows get the proper ink limits, and the grey tones get the prescribed
amount of black, replacing CMY values.

5.4 TRAPPING • 127

Keylines
Black keylines, or outline frames for photos, are common in many documents. This is another place where a document
should have trapping software applied for every imaging technology. Outline strokes on graphics can also have a
‘hairline’ setting, which asks the output device to make the thinnest line possible for the resolution of the device. This
was intended for in-house studio printers where the resolution is 300 dpi — so the lines are 1/300th of an inch. But
the same command sent to a 3,000 lspi plate-setter will generate a line 1/3000th of an inch, which is not visible to the
naked eye. These commands must be distinguished in PostScript and replaced with lines at an appropriate resolution —
trapping and preflight software will do this.
Knock outs
The use of solid black backgrounds is becoming more popular in documents, which can cause problems in reproduction
with all imaging technologies. The first problem is with filling in details in the graphic shapes that are knocked out of
the solid black background. Fine type serifs, small registered or trademark symbols, or the fine hairlines mentioned
above will all fill in and be obliterated when imaged. The problem is multiplied when we boost the black colour by
adding screened values of cyan, magenta, or yellow to the colour block. When white type or graphics knock out of these
background panels, any slight mis-registration of any colour will leave a halo of that colour in the white type or graphic.
This problem can also be solved with trapping software. Essentially, the trapping engine outlines all the white type with
a small ‘black only’ stroke that knocks out the process colour that boosts the black, making the white type fatter in
that colour separation. This ‘reverse trapping’ works well when applied to the four imaging technologies we have been
examining: lithography, flexography, electrophotography, and inkjet.

5.5 Transparency
Wayne Collins

The biggest challenge in reproducing computer graphics on output devices in today’s marketplace is dealing with
transparency in graphic files. This truly emphasizes the importance of WYSIWYG in proofing for the graphic
communications industry. We must first emphasize that page layout graphic software is not developed for producing
documents for mechanical reproduction. This software prioritizes the creation of documents for viewing on electronic
media; they are created on a computer screen for viewing on a computer screen. We have reviewed some of the issues
with rasterizing vector shapes consistently, and reliably representing colour from one device to another. Viewing a
graphic with three-dimensional transparent elements is significantly different on an illuminated medium where the
light is transmitted compared to an opaque medium where the light is reflected. It is very hard to judge how the
transparent effects will translate from one to another. There is room for the same kind of collaborative research in this
realm, as there was in developing OpenType font architecture and ICC profiles.
The problems in WYSIWYG production for transparency fall in two categories. The first problem is setting expectations
so a designer can make a reasonable prediction of how the document will look when imaged on a given media. The
second problem is the sheer proportions of the computational processes we are asking of a RIP. PostScript is a threedimensional language that allows a creator to stack and prioritize elements on a page. The RIP can literally ‘throw away’
raster data that is knocked out by graphic elements that completely cover the elements behind. If those elements have to
show through the foreground elements by 20%, the RIP must hold much more raster data in physical memory addresses.
Many times, data is lost if there are not enough addresses available for the computations, and this can change from one
processing of the document to the next.
Designers can employ strategies at each level of document creation to manage these problems. The first strategy is to
use layers well in document creation. By isolating different effects on separate layers, it becomes easier to isolate and
edit the transparent effects when they don’t produce the desired results in the final output. The layers can be included
in a PDF file of the document, and this allows the possibility of relatively quick editing in PDF editing software closer to
the output stage. This can be a completely different working style for some graphic artists. If we start with the premise
that the computer screen representation of the document is NOT good WYSIWYG and will probably need editing, then
we can justify working with layers more to isolate effects. We can organize design elements on layers after creation —
when we are fine-tuning the effects. Usually, this is a good technique when creating many elements on several page
dimensions. Designers can review their documents and decide if there are distinct dimensional levels, as page elements
are pushed further into the background to pull other page elements forward. A simple example is a book cover for a
retrospective, with pictures from four distinct decades. The photos and type from each decade can be set on distinct
layers, and transparent values of 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% can be set for each layer. The screen will render one version
of the document, and the printer will render another. It is easier to fine-tune the four layer levels of transparency than
to go back and set new transparency levels for dozens of individual page elements.
Another strategy that must be considered for processing multiple transparent page elements is allowing the page layout
software to raster the page elements, so it sends raster data to the RIP. This technique treats the transparent elements,
such as a photograph on the page, and allows the creator to choose the resolution of the raster. Care must be taken here
to ensure overlapping vector elements will raster at the same resolution in the RIP. Let’s say we have a type block that
crosses a photo on the page, but it is transparent to let the photo show through the type. If we rasterize the transparent
type at 300 ppi — the resolution of the photo — it will be significantly different from the raster of the vector type at

128

5.5 TRANSPARENCY • 129

the RIP, which might be 3,000 lspi for some plate-setters. The letter shape will be 10 times thicker over the photo, and
that will be VERY noticeable if the type crosses the photo in the middle of the glyph. The solution is to make sure to
raster the transparent type at 3,000 ppi to match the plate-setter raster. This makes the PDF file very large because it
contains lots of raster data. But this solution is also a disadvantage because it does not allow late-stage editing of the
transparent values in the PDF file. The advantage is that the transparency elements will have better WYSIWYG, process
more consistently in multiple RIPs, and use less RIP resources in processing.
It is very important to be aware of the transparent elements you are creating in a document. It is not always apparent
when using effects, plug-ins, or effects filters available in page layout software. Using a bevel or emboss effect, or a
simple drop shadow, makes that page element use transparent routines in the RIP. Programs like Adobe InDesign let
designers view all the transparent elements on a page. Designers should examine each one to decide if it should be
rasterized before RIP-ing or at the RIP. This is a good point at which to decide if transparent elements can be grouped,
or organized, on common layers. It is also a good point to decide how the transparent element contributes to the
design, and how critical the level of transparency, or WYSIWG value, is in the overall design. In the retrospective book
cover design referred to above, WYSIWYG is very important in communicating the message of the book and getting
predictable results.
Transparent elements can be rasterized at the page layout stage, the PDF creation stage, and at the RIP stage for the final
output device. Adobe Acrobat also has a tool to view transparent elements in a PDF file. It is important for a designer
to compare the transparent elements in the PDF to those in the page layout software. The primary concern is that the
elements rasterized in the PDF are no longer editable, so it is critical that the levels are right to create the desired overall
effect. It is also important for a preflight operator to view the transparent elements in a PDF file to check what the RIP
will have to process and to make sure the computational resources are available. If there are processing errors in the
final output, they are most likely to occur in rendering the transparent objects. Viewing the transparent elements on a
page in Acrobat should provide a mental checklist for the operator when she or he views the final output.
Communication Is Key
The graphic communications industry still has collaborative work to do to make the processing of transparent elements
on a page more predictable and repeatable. It is important for designers to understand the problems they can be creating
for a RIP, especially for output on an extremely high-resolution device like a plate-setter for waterless lithography. It is
also important for operators who are managing documents with lots of transparency to be aware of the checkpoints in a
document, and to know when there is not adequate WYSIWYG for the transparent elements on a page. Good questions
for all stakeholders to ask when processing a document that relies on many transparent elements are:
•
•
•
•

Where are the transparent elements?
Did they process correctly?
Is anything missing in the layers that should show through the transparency?
Are there transparency values that can be adjusted to optimize the overall effect?

Let’s review the primary tools for reproducing transparent page elements in a document. We can utilize layers in a
document for setting common transparency values. We should view all transparent elements in a document before and
after creating a PDF file. There are several stages to rasterizing the transparent elements. The earlier we rasterize them,
the less editable the document becomes, and the more consistent the final output will be. We are creating a larger file to
process when we rasterize transparent elements early. Much less computational resources are required at the RIP, and
the more predictable our final output will be. When managing late-stage processing of transparency, we must be aware
that what we are viewing on a computer screen is not necessarily a good representation of the final output. Graphic
artists at all levels of production must pay attention to the transparent areas of a document to check for accuracy.

5.6 Imposition
Wayne Collins

Imposition of individual graphics page files serves two primary purposes. The first, and perhaps most important
purpose, is to utilize media and manufacturing equipment with the most economic efficiencies. The second is to add
what has historically been referred to as ‘furniture’ to the manufactured sheet to control processes. We will discuss
both priorities for each primary imaging technology we are examining in this book. There is also a range of equipment
capabilities for each technology that affects how documents are imposed. There are a few ways to impose the files either
pre-RIP or post-RIP. We will also look at ways of imposing in graphic creation software and in specialized imposition
software.
The first technology we will look at is electrophotography, where imposition is perhaps the most underutilized.
Electrophotographic, or Xerox-type copiers are usually used for short-run lengths with demands for instant turnaround.
Duplexing is the simplest type of imposition, but there are four choices for how to orient the back of a single page on
the front. The duplexing style can be specified in the print driver, in the PDF file, or in the RIP. Most small printers will
turn on duplexing, rather than image the fronts, turn the printed paper over the right way, and image the back of the
sheet. Fewer will take the time to utilize the machine and media capabilities to step and repeat an image two up on a
larger sheet to half the run time. Yet, as a manufacturing process, electrophotography is the slowest technology for image
reproduction, and the most in need of saving time. There are simple rules of automation that can be programmed in a
RIP to automatically impose if a run length is over 100 copies. For example, letter-size documents are the most often
imaged on this type of equipment. If run lengths of more than 100 copies were imposed two up on a tabloid sheet, it
would halve the run time and open up more imaging time on the machine. This introduces another process — cutting
the sheets in half before final delivery. Management can determine how well the imaging engine run time is utilized and
when it is efficient to have the same operator cut printed sheets in half. Making that management decision requires a
knowledge of workflow options for efficiency. Those efficiencies are the primary purpose of implementing imposition
software.
Using a ‘step and repeat’ or ‘duplexing’ imposition of single-page file is the simplest example of imposing files for
electrophotographic workflows. More and more copiers have capabilities to fold and bind the finished product ‘inline’
in one continuous process. This process is driven by imposing the single-page files in the correct order as they are
processed in the RIP, so they image in the proper spot on the media to fold, and bind together in the correct order.
Imposing page files for binding styles usually follows two types of machine capabilities: saddle stitching and perfect
binding. Saddle stitching is a binding process that folds the media after it is imaged on both sides, stacks the printed
folded sheets one inside the other, and applies staples to the spine of the book. The other dominant style of book binding
built into copiers is perfect binding. Media is imaged on both sides and folded, but the folded sheets are stacked on top
of each other, glue is applied, and a cover sheet is wrapped around the glued book to encase the spine. The pages have to
be imposed in a completely different order on the printed sheets. The first and last sheets of a saddle-stitched book are
imaged on the same sheet, whereas a perfect-bound book has the first pages imaged on the same sheet, and last pages on
separate sheets of media.
There are many options for folding a sheet of substrate before binding it together. The options increase the larger a
sheet is. An imposition must account for the preferences that are best practices for the specific machines involved. If
we look at sheet-fed lithography first, we can identify some common best practices that can also apply to toner-based

130

5.6 IMPOSITION • 131

electrophotography and inkjet. We shall leave an examination of imposition for flexography to discuss nested dieline
shapes for packaging applications.
Imposition standards are based on workflows for standard-sized pages, primarily letter-sized pages measuring 8½” x
11″. We speak of two up devices that can generally image substrates up to a maximum size of 12″ x 18″ or 13″ x 19.” Two
up devices can accommodate two letter-sized pages plus bleeds, grip, marks, and colour bars — sometimes referred to
as furniture on an imposed sheet. These four elements all serve a purpose in page reproduction manufacturing that we
shall define later. Four up devices generally accommodate imaging substrates up to 20″ x 29″ to image four letter-sized
pages. Forty-inch devices are referred to as eight up and image on a maximum sheet size of 30″ x 40″, which can image
eight letter-sized pages and the furniture mentioned above.
There are four common styles of imposition for eight up devices: sheet-wise, work and turn, work and tumble, and cut
and stack.

Figure 5.1 (by Ken Jeffery)

Sheet-wise impositions image the fronts of all pages on one side of the sheet and impose all the backs on a separate set
of plates for a press run that will back up all the sheets. Work and turn imposes the fronts on one half of the sheet and
the backs on the other half, with the axis running perpendicular to the grip of the sheet (see Figures 5.1 and 5.2). Work
and tumble imposes all fronts on the bottom half of a sheet and backup images on the top half of the sheet (see Figure
5.3). The sheets are flipped halfway through the press run, with the axis parallel to the grip edge of the sheet. Cut and
stack imposes the pages so full press sheets can be collated, and the collated sheets cut and stacked in order on top of
each other to make a final book (see Figure 5.4).
Lithographic web offset presses have imposition orders that depend on how wide the web of paper is, and how many
web rolls and half rolls will be brought together before folding on a first former, and cutting on a second former. There
are many options for configuring a web-fed litho press, depending on the number of pages in a publication. Usually, the
entire publication is printed and folded by running the stack of web paper together and folding it in half over a former.
Imposition has to account for creep and bottling when imposing for thicker publications. Creep pushes the image on a
page closer in to the spine the further the page is toward the spine, by the width of the thickness of the publication at the

132 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

Figure 5.2 (by Ken Jeffery)

Figure 5.3 (by Ken Jeffery)

stapled, spine edge. Bottling skews the image on a page to account for the skewing of web rolls of paper that are folded
in very thick signatures. The thicker the folded signature of a bound book, the more skewing takes place, which should
be accounted for in the ‘Bottling’ value in an imposition.
Imposition for inkjet mediums is usually done when the image is rasterized. The RIP will store the raster image and
nest several raster images together to fill the dimensions of the media being imaged. This is usually set as an automated
function in the RIP, and is tied to the size and cost of the media being used. When imaging very low resolution images

5.6 IMPOSITION • 133

Figure 5.4 (by Ken Jeffery)

on very low cost media, the manufacturer is usually more concerned with the speed of the machine than the utilization
of the media. If an expensive media is being used, the automatic imposition will be utilized in the RIP to save media.
Often inkjet images are not square, and the media will be die cut or cut with a router after imaging. The RIP can be set to
impose the images so the shapes nest inside each other. This is usually outside of the automatic features for imposition
in a RIP, and requires operator intervention. In that case, the imposition operator must know the die cutting or router
processes very well to make sure the imaged media can be cut out even though it is nested with another image.
This nesting of images to be die cut after imaging is most prevalent in flexographic printing for packaging. Most
package or label shapes are not square and the media is expensive. The imposition function becomes very important
for preparing flexographic plates. Nesting the die cut shapes for several packages together on a continuous roll of
media takes very specialized software and a highly skilled operator. There are many variables to consider, including
media thickness, ink coverage, die shapes, glue releases, and image floor on the flexo plate. Flexo imaging for packaging
generally takes more understanding of CAD software and the construction of the final three-dimensional product.
Imposition operators must know the structural requirements as well as the press limitations to nest together several
package images on the same press run.
The final consideration for all impositions in all imaging technologies is the computer resource requirements for the
RIP. We usually require an imaging engine to raster a single document, and proof it one page at a time through a proofing
device. When we impose the same document with many other pages in completely different orientations, sometimes
RIP processing errors can occur. Fonts drop out, and more commonly, transparent elements do not process properly.
This is another checkpoint to make sure the imposed image matches the proof of the single page. It is essential to discuss
preflighting for print at this point to establish where the routine checkpoints in document processing should be.

5.7 Preflight
Wayne Collins

We have covered quite a few parameters that must be considered when preparing a computer graphic for manufactured
image reproduction. The parameters shift with different substrates and imaging technologies. The task of checking a
computer graphic document in preparation for the manufacturing process is called preflight. Most graphics are created
by designers who are working separately from the manufacturer. In some cases, preflight preparation is the
responsibility of the designer, or graphics creator, and in some cases, it is the responsibility of the manufacturer. Some
manufacturers charge extra if they have to correct a graphics file that is not prepared properly for their imaging process.
Most do not charge extra for preflighting, trapping, or imposing a file for their imaging process. Problems occur when
all parties believe a file is prepared properly, but it causes errors in the RIP process. A poor font, improper colour
separations, and transparency settings that drop out layers on a page are problems that occur most often. This is when
time, materials, and money are wasted, and critical media campaign deadlines are missed. Preflight tries to catch the
problems before they reach the RIP.
Designers or graphics creators can purchase separate preflight software that will generate reports about a PDF or
PostScript file before they submit it to a manufacturer. The most popular dedicated preflight software is from
Markzware and is called FlightCheck. There are also a few other companies that are popular in the marketplace. Enfocus
bundles its preflight software with a suite of PDF editing tools called Pitstop. The Adobe Creative Suite has preflight
functions built into its software suite. Adobe InDesign is the page layout software of choice for creating multi-page
documents such as brochures, pamphlets , or books. The preflight module in InDesign will generate a report that can
be included with the packaged contents a designer should provide to a manufacturer. The report will list important
information about the InDesign document, such as that found in the list below. Adobe Illustrator also has a builtin preflight tool, and Adobe Acrobat has preflight tools that designers should use to analyze their PDF files before
submitting them to a RIP.
Various industries have set PDF standards. The magazine publishing industry, for example, developed a PDF/X standard
to ensure PDF/X files can be written only if they meet a set of specifications that are common for lithographic magazine
production. Other manufacturing processes adopted the standards if they were appropriate for their imaging
technology and PDF workflows.
Most preflight software checks for the following elements in an electronic document:
•
•
•
•
•

5.8 Summary
Wayne Collins

This chapter has looked at computer graphic creation through the lens of a manufacturer that must reproduce the
electronic image on a substrate. The image must be processed through a RIP that drives a laser, or other imaging
technology, to transfer pigments to that substrate. There are unique variables that must be considered in preparing
the computer graphic for the reproduction process. We have explored routines for processing vector data such as
fonts through a RIP, spot colour handling, trapping, and imposition. The next chapter will look at each of the imaging
technologies in more depth.
Exercises

Questions to consider after completing this chapter:

1. Describe six pre-imaging file analysis processes that should be considered when developing a
computer graphic for reproduction manufacture.
2. Describe four major imaging technologies that utilize computer graphics to image on different
substrates.
3. Describe the difference between raster data and vector data when creating a computer graphic file.
4. Compare the raster resolution of the data for a typical lithographic plate-setter compared to the
resolution of a typical inkjet device.
5. How many addressable values can be recorded in an eight-bit byte of computer data?
6. What does the acronym WYSIWYG stand for?
7. How many kerning pairs are present in a ‘good’ font file?
8. What colour matching library has been developed exclusively for process colour printing inks
(CMYK)?
9. What two printing processes must have trapping applied to computer graphics files before making

Digital printing can be defined as the reproduction of an image or document onto a substrate, directly from an electronic
file, without the use of a fixed image plate. Traditional printing transfers an image permanently onto a fixed image plate,
whereas digital printing transfers the image temporarily onto a photoconductive cylinder, called a drum, or directly
onto the substrate itself. Printing in this manner provides some unique capabilities that sets it apart from traditional
print methods. There is virtually no set-up or make ready, finishing tasks can be accomplished inline, and each sheet
can have unique content, which makes this printing method ideal for publication printing, short print runs, or highly
dynamic content.
The two most common digital printing methods in use today are electrophotographic (toner based) and inkjet (ink
based). Both technologies are used in a wide range of printing devices from small desktop printers to large high-volume,
high-speed digital presses. The term digital press is often used to describe commercial digital printers. In the past, speed
was the determining factor of this designation. Today, we have specific criteria published by Idealliance, a not-forprofit member organization that develops standards and best practices for the digital media supply chain (Idealliance,
n.d.). Apart from speed, colour accuracy to meet a specification and consistency over long print runs are key parts of
Idealliance’s certification process. You can find out more at this webpage:
http://www.idealliance.org/certifications/digital-press
For the purposes of this text, we will focus on digital printers and presses used in commercial printing rather than on
consumer or office printers.

6.2 Inkjet
Roberto Medeiros

Inkjet printing is a type of digital imaging where drops of ink are jetted onto the substrate in a very precise pattern from
a nozzle. This nozzle, also called the print head, is required to be very precise and accurate, which is a challenge when
you consider that the goal is to get many thousands of tiny drops of ink to land exactly where needed on the printed
surface. Over time, inkjet technology has become more advanced, allowing greater resolution, more accurate colour,
and overall, finer visual fidelity to the original. The most common method of inkjet printing for commercial purposes is
called drop-on-demand (DOD). This type of inkjet print head only fires each individual droplet of ink when needed (on
demand) and comes in two types, thermal or piezoelectric (see Figure 6.1). Accuracy in DOD inkjet printing is achieved
by keeping the print head close to the surface being printed (substrate) as the velocity of the jetted ink is low.

Figure 6.1 Piezoelectric head on the left, thermal on the right

Thermal Inkjet
In a thermal print head, each nozzle contains a special reservoir that is bounded by a heating element. When current
is passed through the heating element, it causes the ink to expand rapidly, ejecting out of the nozzle to land on the
substrate in a given position. The print head is made up of a matrix of many of these chambers, and each print head is
connected to a different colour of ink. As the ejected ink leaves the chamber, fresh ink is drawn into the reservoir by
surface tension and the vacuum created by the previous drop of ink leaving.
Thermal inkjet is most common in household and consumer grade inkjet printers. A major benefit to using thermal
printhead technology is the relatively inexpensive print head. Since each colour printed requires a separate print head,
and some print devices can contain eight or more colours of ink, thermal technology keeps the initial cost of the device
low and reduces replacement costs when a print head fails, or is damaged.

140

6.2 INKJET • 141

Piezoelectric Inkjet
Piezoelectric (piezo) print heads also use a tiny reservoir to hold a droplet of ink. However, unlike thermal printheads,
piezo heads contain a small flexible membrane, or diaphragm, that moves up and down to squirt the ink out of the print
nozzle. The pressure caused by the flexing of the piezo material is very precise, allowing a drop, or multiple drops, to
strike the substrate accurately. Similar to thermal, the print head is made up of a matrix of a number of these individual
nozzles. And by using multiple print heads, multiple colours are possible.
Piezoelectric is more common in commercial and large-format printing applications, although there are a few consumer
grades of printers that use piezo as well. Piezo is more accurate, and because the ink in the chamber doesn’t have to be
vaporized to form the droplets of ink, piezo can print with a wider variety of inks such as aqueous, ultraviolet, and latex.
Types of Ink
Inkjet printing has become more advanced not only in the mechanics of how the print heads work, but also in the variety
and usage of different types of ink. Below are some common types of ink and a brief explanation of how they might be
used.
Aqueous Ink
Aqueous ink, as discussed earlier, is a water-based ink. This type of ink is used in consumer printers using thermal
technology, but can also be used in commercial piezo printers as well. Aqueous is well suited to thermal technology
because the formulation of the ink allows it to vaporize in the print head for expulsion onto the paper. The water
component of the ink, however, also contributes to its greatest drawback: the susceptibility of the finished printed piece
to run or smear if it gets wet. Many users of desktop printers in their homes have been disappointed when they take
their printed pages outside in the rain. Even a few drops of water can cause the ink to run and bleed into the paper.
In commercial uses, aqueous inkjet is well known for colour fidelity and quality, but the finished piece has to be
protected from moisture. These types of print products would most likely only be used indoors, mounted behind glass,
or with a laminated plastic layer on top. There are water-resistant coatings that can be sprayed onto a finished product,
but even then, you would not want to leave it outside for an extended period of time. Aqueous ink is a common choice
for art prints.
Ultraviolet Inkjet
Ultraviolet (UV) ink is a type of energy-cured ink that stays wet until it is bombarded with ultraviolet radiation. This
UV radiation is commonly projected onto the freshly printed surface by means of a special high-intensity light bulb.
Once the UV rays hit the ink, a special molecular process is triggered, causing the chains of molecules in the ink to
bond and solidify instantly. UV ink does not dry from exposure to air, nor from heat. Once the UV ink has been cured,
however, it is very solid and quite durable.
For commercial use, UV inks tend to be popular for outdoor uses such as banners and signage. Indoor signage is
commonly printed using UV as well because of its durability and rub resistance. Since UV inks dry instantly, they can
be removed from the printer and handled much sooner. UV inks sit mostly on top of the surface of the substrate, and
because of their solid bond are more prone to cracking if bent or folded. UV is not a good choice of ink where flexibility
of the substrate is required.

142 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

Latex Inkjet
Latex ink is a newer formulation that has exploded onto the inkjet printing scene in the last few years. Latex inks are
water based and cure primarily through heat, but more importantly, they are not subject to moisture damage once cured.
This is because the pigment is carried by the latex molecules, and once the latex has bonded to the substrate, the pigment
stays intact. Latex printed products dry immediately and are ready to use as soon as they come off the print device.
Latex inks are used in many commercial applications, particularly where outdoor durability and flexibility are needed.
One of the many common uses of latex inkjet printing is in imaging car wraps. A car wrap is a flexible adhesive material
that is printed flat, then stretched or wrapped around the contours of a vehicle, usually for marketing or advertising
purposes. Figure I.1 in the introduction of this textbook shows an example of a car wrap. Because of this flexibility, latex
printed signage can also be adhered to rougher surfaces such as wood or brick. The popularity of latex can be attributed
to a previously popular inkjet formulation that is solvent based.
Solvent Inkjet
Because of the rise in popularity of latex ink over the last few years, there has been a great decline in the use of
solvent inkjet inks. Formerly, this was the type of ink needed for flexible, durable printing. Solvent inks are formulated
using solvent as a carrier for the pigment, and as the solvent dries, the pigment remains bonded to the substrate. A
big concern for the use of solvent-based printing is the release of volatile organic compounds, or VOCs. These VOCs
are released into the atmosphere during the printing and drying of solvent prints, and have to be vented outdoors so as
not to pollute the workspace. Even newer eco-friendly inks still release VOCs, albeit at a lower level. Some areas have
environmental laws that restrict the release of pollutants into the air (United States Environmental Protection Agency,
2000). Customers often complain about the smell of solvent prints, particularly when used indoors. Because of this,
solvent inkjet is primarily chosen for outdoor uses such as large-format signage, banners, and car wraps. Solvent can be
very economical, and while the quality isn’t as sharp as UV or aqueous, it is excellent for very large projects that will be
viewed from even a moderate distance. Pressure on the solvent ink market comes because most of these uses can now
be achieved with latex inks as well, and the industry has seen a divergence between companies that still use solvent or
eco-solvent inks and those that are switching to latex.

6.3 Electrophotography
Roberto Medeiros

Electrophotography (also known as xerography) is a complex process commonly used in copiers and faxes, as well as in
digital printers. It is an imaging technology that takes a digital file and utilizes a photoreceptor, light source, electrostatic
principles, and toner to produce the printed output. Before this process was used for digital printing, it was extensively
used in analog copiers where a lamp illuminated the page being copied, and then a series of mirrors reflected the page
directly onto the surface of a drum. Digital copiers replaced the direct light path with a sensor that converts the analog
image into digital information, then a laser or an LED array writes the image onto the drum. Many digital printers today
are based on the same platform as digital copiers. The technology has seen many improvements over the years, but the
electrophotographic process at its core remains relatively unchanged.
Photoreceptor
The photoreceptor is commonly referred to as a drum. It is a cylinder coated with a material that becomes conductive
when exposed to light. Areas that are not exposed have a high resistance which allows these areas to hold the
electrostatic charge necessary for the process.
Light Source
Light sources used in digital printing include LED arrays or, more commonly, lasers. VCSEL (vertical cavity surface
emitting laser) is an advanced type of laser used in the most current digital presses in the market. A VCSEL array can
position its beam with high accuracy (addressability) for optimal clarity, resolution, and image positioning. This makes
it ideally suited for a digital press.
Electrostatic Principles

Figure 6.2 Like charges repel each other while opposite charges are
attracted (by Roberto Medeiros)

To understand electrophotography, we must first understand some basic electrostatic principles. When certain materials

143

144 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

come in contact then separate from each other, these materials can become electrically charged. Rubbing these materials
together can increase this effect. This is called the triboelectric effect. Static electricity buildup on your clothes in a
dryer or from rubbing a balloon on your hair are examples of the triboelectric effect. Charges can have either a positive
or negative polarity. Like charges repel each other while opposite charges are attracted, in much the same way as the
polarities in magnets (see Figure 6.2).
These properties are at the core of the technology and are utilized in almost every stage of the digital imaging process.
Toner Basics
Toner is a very fine, dry powder medium used in the electrophotographic or xerographic process. It is composed
primarily of a resin and includes pigment, wax, and process-enhancing additives. The term xerography, in fact, is
derived from the Greek words xeros, ‘dry’ and graphia, ‘writing,’ reflecting how toner rather than ink is used in the
imaging process. Toner particles become electrically charged when stirred or agitated through a triboelectric effect. The
composition of the toner not only contributes to its imaging characteristics but to its ability to maintain and control its
charge properties. The shape of the toner also is a factor in its charging capability. This electrical charge is what allows
the toner to be precisely manipulated throughout the process.
There are two basic types of toner production, pulverized and chemical (Figure 6.3). Pulverized toner was commonly
used in earlier digital printers and is manufactured by successive compound mixing and grinding steps until the desired
consistency and size is achieved. The resulting toner particles are irregular in size and shape and typically average
around 6.2 to 10.2 microns in size. Pulverized toner produces good results, up to 600 dpi resolution; however, a
consistent size and shape along with a smaller particle size is required to produce better clarity and detail at higher
resolutions.

Figure 6.3 Two basic types of toner production

Chemical toners were introduced later to overcome those limitations and are in common use today. Each manufacturer
has its own process for creating this type of toner and unique names as well. Xerox’s EA toner, Ricoh’s PxP toner, and
Konica Minolta’s Simitri toner are all examples of chemical toners. As the name suggests, chemical toners are created
through a process of building or ‘growing’ the particle chemically. This process allows for the precise control of the
shape and size of the toner particle (under 5 microns in some cases), resulting in higher definition and resolution
capabilities. Resolutions of 1,200 dpi and 2,400 dpi are possible largely due to the use of this type of toner. Other benefits

6.3 ELECTROPHOTOGRAPHY • 145

include much lower energy consumption, both in the manufacturing process and printing process, as well as narrower
particle size and charge distributions.
Here is a YouTube video of how chemical toner is made: https://youtu.be/852TWDP61T4
Dry toner comes in two forms: mono component and dual component. Both rely on magnetic iron or iron oxide
particles to ‘hold’ the charged toner on a magnetic roller. Mono component toners incorporate the magnetic material
in the composition of the toner particle itself where dual component toners have the magnetic material mixed together
with the toner but as separate components. This mixture is called developer.
ElectroInk
ElectroInk is a unique form of toner used in HP Indigo digital presses. The toner comes in the form of a paste and is
mixed internally in the press with imaging oil, a lightweight petroleum distillate. This type of toner is considered a liquid
toner as the particles are suspended in the liquid imaging oil, but still uses an electrophotographic process for imaging.
One of the important advantages of this type of toner is its particle size. ElectroInk toner particles are 1 to 2 microns,
significantly smaller than the smallest dry toner particle. At this size, a dry toner would become airborne and would be
very difficult to control. The toner and oil suspension achieves higher resolutions, uniform gloss, sharp image edges,
and very thin image layers. A thin image layer allows the toner to conform to the surface of the substrate, producing a
consistent look between imaged and non-imaged areas. A drawback of this toner, however, is that substrates may need
to be pre-treated in order for the toner to adhere properly. There are substrates available for use specifically on HP
Indigo digital presses, but typically these are more expensive or may not be compatible with other printing methods.
Some Indigo presses are equipped with a pre-treating station that expands substrate compatibility extensively and even
surpasses that of other forms of digital printing.
Nanography
Nanography is a very new and exciting print technology currently in development by the creator of the Indigo digital
press, Benny Landa. It borrows some of the same concepts used in the Indigo but with a different approach to the
implementation of these. The technology centres around NanoInk, a breakthrough ink with pigment sizes in the tens of
nanometers. In comparison, pigments found in good-quality offset inks are in the 500 nanometre range. Colorants
intensify and ink density increases at this microscopic level, thereby expanding the ink’s colour gamut considerably. The
ink uses water as a carrier instead of imaging oil making it more cost effective and eco-friendly. Billions of ink droplets
are jetted onto a heated blanket, not directly onto the substrate as in inkjet printing. The ink spreads uniformly on the
blanket and the water quickly evaporates leaving only an ultra-thin (approximately 500 nanometres), dry polymeric film.
This film transfers completely onto the substrate on contact and produces a tough, abrasion-resistant image. This print
technology can be used with almost any substrate without pre-treatment and, due to its minuscule film thickness, does
not interfere with the finish. Whether high gloss or matte, the ink finish matches that of the substrate. Although the
technology is poised to revolutionize the print industry, the first press to use it is currently in beta testing. You can find
the latest news and more information on nanography on this webpage: http://www.landanano.com/nanography

6.4 Electrophotographic Process
Roberto Medeiros

The electrophotographic process consists of seven stages (see Figure 6.4). For the purpose of this text, we will be
describing the process using a negatively charged dry toner. The process is the same for a positive toner except the
polarity would be reversed in each stage.

Figure 6.4 (by Roberto Medeiros)

Charging
In the first stage, a high negative voltage of approximately -900 volts is provided to a charge roller (see Figure 6.5).
The voltage used varies by manufacturer and model. The charge roller applies a uniform layer of negative charge to the
surface of the drum. The resistivity of the unexposed photosensitive drum coating allows the charge to remain on the
surface.

146

6.4 ELECTROPHOTOGRAPHIC PROCESS • 147

Figure 6.5 (by Roberto Medeiros)

Exposure
A laser is used to write the image onto the charged surface (see Figure 6.6). Because the photosensitive coating on the
drum becomes conductive when exposed to light, the charges on the surface of the drum exposed to the laser conduct
to the base layer, which is connected to a ground. The result is a near zero volt image and a negative background. This
is known as the latent image.

Figure 6.6 (by Roberto Medeiros)

Development
Many digital printers and presses use a dual component development system (see Figure 6.7). The developer is a mixture
of non-magnetic toner and a magnetic carrier. As the developer is stirred and the particles rub up against each other,
a triboelectric charge is generated between the them. The toner becomes negatively charged while the carrier becomes
positive. The opposite charges cause the toner to be attracted to the carrier. A magnetic development roller holds the
mostly iron carrier in alignment with magnetic lines of force forming a magnetic brush. This magnetic brush in turn
‘carries’ the attracted toner to the surface of the drum. A high negative bias is applied to the development roller repelling
the toner onto the drum. The toner is attracted to the areas of the drum exposed by the laser, which, being close to zero

148 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

volts, is much more positive than the negatively charged toner. In this way, the latent image is developed. As the carrier
remains on the development roller, it continues to attract toner from the hopper to maintain the optimal concentration
on the magnetic brush.

Figure 6.7 (by Roberto Medeiros)

Transfer
A sheet of paper or substrate passes between the drum and a transfer charge roller that has a high positive voltage applied
to it (see Figure 6.8). The negatively charged toner of the developed latent image on the drum is attracted to the more
positive transfer roller and adheres to the sheet in-between. The charge applied to the back of the sheet causes the paper
to cling to the drum. A high negative voltage is applied to a discharge plate immediately after the transfer charge roller
to aid in the separation of the sheet from the drum. The curvature of the drum along with the weight and rigidity of the
sheet also aid in the separation.
A more advanced method of transfer utilizes an intermediate transfer belt system. This is most common on colour
digital presses where four or more colours are transferred onto the belt before transferring the complete image onto
the sheet. Charge rollers beneath the belt, under each drum, pull off the developed latent images of each separation
directly onto the belt. In the transfer stage, a transfer charge roller beneath the belt applies a negative charge to push the
toner onto the sheet. A second roller, directly beneath the first on the other side of the belt, applies pressure keeping the
paper in contact with the belt and aiding in transfer for more textured stocks. The lower roller may have a small positive
charge applied to it or may be grounded. Some systems can also alternate the charge applied to the transfer charge roller
to further aid toner application onto textured substrates.
After this stage, the sheet moves on to fusing where the toner permanently adheres to the substrate. The next two stages
described below are post-imaging steps that are necessary to prepare the drum surface for the next print cycle.

6.4 ELECTROPHOTOGRAPHIC PROCESS • 149

Figure 6.8 (by Roberto Medeiros)

Cleaning
After the transfer stage, some toner may be left behind on the surface of the drum. If left there, the background of each
successive print would slowly become darker and dirtier. To prevent this, a cleaning blade removes any residual toner
from the drum’s surface (see Figure 6.9). Some systems will recycle this toner back to the developing unit, but mostly the
waste toner is collected in a container for disposal.

Figure 6.9 (by Roberto Medeiros)

150 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

Erasing
In this stage, an LED array exposes the length of the drum, bringing this area of the drum to near zero volts. This
prepares the drum surface for the charging stage of the next print cycle.
Fusing
This is the final stage in the electophotographic process. The fusing mechanism, or fuser, consists of a heat roller, a
pressure roller, and cleaning mechanism (see Figure 6.10). Toner is composed mostly of resin. When the toner is heated
by the heat roller and pressure applied by the complement pressure roller, it melts and is pressed into the fibres of the
sheet. The toner is never absorbed by the paper or substrate but rather is bonded to the surface. A negative charge is
applied to the heat roller or belt to prevent the toner from being attracted to it and the cleaning section removes any
toner or other contaminates that may have remained on the heat roller. Heat may also be applied to the pressure roller
(at a much lower temperature) to prevent the sheet from curling.

Figure 6.10 (by Roberto Medeiros)

Along with the transfer stage, fusing can be greatly affected by the paper or substrate used. The thicker and heavier
the sheet, the more heat it absorbs. Because of this, these sheets require higher temperatures so there is sufficient heat
remaining to melt the toner. Insufficient heat can cause the toner to scratch off easily or not bond at all. Too much heat
can cause moisture in the substrate to evaporate quickly and get trapped beneath the toner causing tiny bubbles that

6.4 ELECTROPHOTOGRAPHIC PROCESS • 151

prevent the toner from sticking wherever they occur. This issue is seen more on thinner stocks that do not absorb as
much heat. Too much heat can also cause toner residue to stick to the heater roller and deposit it on subsequent sheets.
The heat roller can heat up quite quickly but may take much longer to cool down. This can cause delays in producing
work that switches between different paper weights. To combat this, some devices use a thin belt that can be both heated
and cooled quickly in place of the heater roller. In some cases, a cooling mechanism is also employed further mitigating
the cooling lag.

6.5 Paper Basics
Roberto Medeiros

When talking about substrates used in printing, paper is usually what comes to mind. Paper is made most commonly
from wood fibre. Today, many papers also have some percentage of recycled fibre as well as fillers and other additives.
These all contribute to the quality of the paper itself and to the quality of the printed output. It’s important to understand
some basic attributes of paper as they all have a direct impact on imaging processes and results.
Formation
Formation refers to the distribution of fibres, fillers, and additives in paper and how evenly they come together. When
you hold a sheet up to a strong light source and look through it, the mix of dark and light areas are the result of
formation. The more uniform the formation, the less mottling is observed in the paper. Papers with uniform formation
accept inks and toners more evenly, have reduced print mottling, and enhance clarity.
Opacity
In strict terms, opacity is the degree to which light is prevented from travelling through a paper. In practical terms, it’s
how well a paper prevents the image on the backside of a sheet showing through to the front. This is measured on a scale
from 1 to 100, where 100 is completely opaque. Opacity can be increased with fillers, pigments, or even coatings. In
general, a thicker paper, coloured paper, or coated paper is more opaque than its counterparts. Opacity values are very
important when projects require thinner paper stocks and both sides of the sheet are being printed.
Basis Weight and Grammage
When looking at the label on a ream of paper used in North America, you usually see two weight designations: the basis
2
weight, designated in pounds (#) and the equivalent grammage, in grams per square metre (g/m or gsm). In most of
the world, grammage is primarily used. In North America, the basis weight is more common. Grammage is simply how
many grams per square metre paper weighs. No other factors are represented by this designation. So we can deduce that
the higher the grammage, the thicker or denser the sheet. Basis weight is the weight of 500 sheets of paper at a specific
size, known as the ‘parent’ sheet size, which varies based on the historical use of the specific paper. To understand this
better, let’s examine two different basis weights.
Cover basis weight is based on a 20″ x 26″ parent sheet. So 500 sheets of 80# cover (the # symbol is used to indicate
pounds) at the parent sheet size weighs 80 pounds. Likewise, 500 sheets of 80# text at the text-weight parent sheet size of
25″ x 38″ also weighs 80 pounds. This can be very confusing as a cut sheet of letter (8.5″ x 11″), 80# text, is much thinner
than the same size of 80# cover. Table 6.1 shows common basis weights, parent sheet sizes, and typical uses.

Used for index cards and tab stock. Tab stocks are typically uncoated 90# index.

Although basis weight is used as the primary weight on a paper label and description, a digital press will typically use
grammage to define the weight property when assigning a paper to a tray. Paper weight is one of the key characteristics
that affect many parameters on the digital press, including how much vacuum strength is used for feeding, how much
charge is required to transfer toner to paper, and how much heat is required to maintain a consistent fusing temperature
to bond toner to the paper, among others. Entering the wrong values for the paper weight can cause paper misfeeds,
poor image quality, or toner not adhering to the paper. Using grammage simplifies data entry and avoids errors due
to incorrect basis weight selection for the numeric weight value. It may, however, require one to do a conversion
calculation if only basis weight is provided. The following conversion factors can be used to do these calculations.
Conversion Factors:

Bond (lbs.) x

Grain Direction
In the paper manufacturing process, a slurry of fibre travels over a high-speed mesh conveyor belt that is oscillating
side to side. This action and movement causes the fibres to interlace and develop a predominant alignment along the
direction of movement. This predominant alignment of the fibres is called grain direction. Short grain refers to fibres
running parallel to the short dimension of the sheet, and, conversely, long grain refers to fibres running parallel to the
long dimension of the sheet.
It is important to keep grain direction in mind when choosing a paper for a project. You need to consider the print

154 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

process and binding or finishing method you will use, as choosing the wrong grain direction can produce poor results
or may be incompatible with the printing method you have chosen. Sheet fed offset lithography papers are often long
grain and are most common. Digital presses require the grain to run perpendicular to the feed direction in order to feed
properly and make the sharp turns typically found in a digital press. In this case, most sheets are fed into the press with
the short edge first therefore requiring short grain paper. When folding is required, folds that run parallel to the grain
will be smooth and sharp while folds that run across the grain will be ragged, and the fibres on the top of the sheet may
pull apart. Toner used in digital printing bonds to the surface of the paper and does not penetrate. Folding across the
grain will cause the toner to break apart where the fibres separate.
The second or underlined dimension of the sheet will indicate the direction of the grain. For example, 18″ x 12″ is a short
grain sheet, and 12″ x 18″ is long grain. If the underline method is used, short grain would be 12″ x 18″ and long grain
would be 12″ x 18“. If the dimensions are not noted or the sheet is not in its original packaging, grain direction can be
determined by folding the sheet along both dimensions. As noted previously, a fold that runs parallel to the grain will
be smooth and sharp while a fold that runs across the grain will be ragged. You can also gently bend the paper in either
direction. The bend running in the direction offering the least resistance is the grain direction.
Caliper
Caliper, unlike grammage and basis weight, is a measure of thickness. The most common measurement used in North
America is thousandths of an inch, designated as points (common for paper) or mils (common for synthetic paper). This
terminology can be confusing, however, as points can also refer to 1/72 of an inch when referring to font size, line
thickness, and dimensions on a page. Mils can be confused with millimetres as well. A common misconception is that
points and mils can be converted to grammage or basis weight. This is not true. The caliper can vary depending on the
coatings or finish. In general, a rougher finished stock will have a higher caliper than the same weight of a smooth stock.
Coatings can be heavier than paper fibre so coated paper can have a smaller caliper than the same weight of an uncoated
counterpart. A process called calendaring, which irons the paper between two highly polished chrome rollers, improves
smoothness and printability but also reduces the caliper without changing the weight of the paper.
Brightness and Whiteness
Brightness and whiteness define the optical properties of paper and differ mainly in how they are measured.
Whiteness measures the reflective properties of the paper across the entire visible spectrum of light (defined by CIE).
In other words, it defines how white the paper is. A perfect reflecting, non-fluorescent white material measures 100
whiteness. Brightness also measures the reflective properties of paper, on a scale of 1 to 100, but specifically in the blue
area of the spectrum at a principal wavelength of 457 nanometres and 44 nanometres wide (defined by TAPPI and ISO
standards). This wavelength coincides with lignin absorption. Lignin is what binds the cellulose fibres in wood and pulp
and gives it its initial dark brown colour. The more bleaching done to the pulp, the more lignin is removed, and the
higher the blue reflectance and therefore brightness. In most parts of the world, paper whiteness measurement is used;
however, in North America, most papers use brightness measurement instead. Some papers have brightness values that
exceed 100. This is due to the addition of fluorescent whitening agents (FWAs), which return additional blue light when
exposed to UV light. The same is true for whiteness, as papers with higher blue reflectance levels tend to have higher
whiteness levels.
Finish
Finish defines the look and feel of the paper’s surface and can be achieved during the paper-making process (onmachine) or after (off-machine). On-machine finishes are achieved by the application of a pattern onto the paper by a
marking roller while it is still wet. Examples of on-machine finishes are smooth, vellum, laid and felt (see Table 6.2).

6.5 PAPER BASICS • 155

Off-machine finishes are accomplished with rollers that press the pattern into the paper after it has been made. Offmachine finishes are also known as embossed finishes. Linen, stipple, and canvas are examples of these; Table 6.3 gives
a description of each.

Typical Uses

Smooth

Paper is passed through various calendaring rollers,
producing a finish that is uniform, flat, and smooth to the
touch.

Ideal for general digital printing and
copying as toner is applied to the
surface and does not penetrate the
fibres.

Vellum

A consistent eggshell appearance that is not quite as smooth
as smooth finish but has a velvety feel. Not to be confused
with the substrate called vellum, which is translucent.

Used most commonly for book paper.

Laid

Consists of a series of wide-spaced lines (chain lines) and
more narrowly spaced lines (laid lines), which are at 90
degrees to the chain lines.

Used for letterhead, reports,
presentations.

Felt

A felt-covered roller is used to produce this finish. The
appearance resembles that of felt.

Used for letterhead, reports,

Used where a subtle uneven texture is desired.

Canvas

Simulates the surface of canvas.

Used for art prints or where a ‘painted’ appearance
is desired.

Finishes

Coated papers have calcium carbonate or china clay applied to their surface. The coating fills in the spaces between the

156 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

fibres on the paper’s surface, resulting in a smoother finish. The amount of coating and calendaring produces different
finishes and gloss appearance. Examples of coated finishes are matte, dull, satin, silk, and gloss, described in Table 6.4.

Cast coated paper has a very high gloss finish on the front side and is uncoated and rough on the back. The high gloss
finish is created by applying a heated chrome roller to the coated surface to quickly dry it while moisture is released
through the uncoated back of the sheet. Calendaring is not used, allowing the back surface to be rough and ideally suited
for labels. Cast coated paper holds ink well, but the toner used in digital printing may not adhere to it.

6.6 Page Description Languages
Roberto Medeiros

Many page description languages (PDL) exist today; however, Printer Command Language (PCL) and PostScript are the
most common and widely adopted. Each has its strengths, weaknesses, and jobs for which it is best suited. It is important
to understand these differences and choose the method best suited to your particular printing requirements.
PCL
PCL is a page description language developed by Hewlett-Packard (HP) and was originally used on HP impact and
inkjet printers. PCL 3 was the first version to be used with a laser printer, the HP LaserJet, released in 1984, around
the same time PostScript was introduced. The goal of PCL was to have an efficient printer control language that could
be implemented consistently across HP’s printer line. Simple commands and functionality would not require expensive
print controllers, making it very attractive for utility-level printing. Many other printer manufacturers implemented
PCL for this reason. Commands are embedded at the beginning of the print job and set the parameters for the printer
to use for the job. These commands remain set until a new value is assigned for the command or the printer is reset. If
the printer does not support a specific command, it ignores it.
When colour laser printing became available, PCL 5c was developed with similar goals. New commands were added to
the existing command set, as was the case with all the predecessors, to add support for colour printing. This ensured
backwards compatibility while minimizing development. When it came to colour, HP’s goal was to have colour on the
printed page look the same as what was displayed on screen. There were many challenges to achieving this, so print
quality adjustments were included to give users the ability to fine-tune the output. With the emergence and widespread
adoption of the sRGB standard to define and describe colour on a display, the PCL colour command set could be
simplified by adopting this standard for colour printing. Thus, HP’s goal could be achieved without the complexity and
overhead of a full colour management system. Operating systems and applications, for the most part, have standardized
how they display colour in sRGB, so this approach is the simplest way to achieve acceptable colour between display and
print. PCL is most appropriate for general office use where a simple, low-cost print device that produces good quality
colour is expected. It is not suitable, however, for a colour critical or print production environment where precision and
full colour management is required.
PostScript
PostScript is a page description and programming language developed by Adobe that describes text, graphics, and
images, and their placement on a page, independent of the intended output destination. The code created is in plain
text that can be written and examined with a basic text editor. The output itself can either be to a printer, display, or
other device possessing a PostScript interpreter, making it a device independent language. The interpreter processes the
PostScript instructions to create a raster image the device can render. The interpreter is often referred to as a RIP or
raster image processor for this reason. It is possible to write valid PostScript code from scratch, but it is impractical as
page composition applications can either generate the PostScript code directly or can utilize a print driver, which can
convert the page to the PostScript language.
Since PostScript is a general-purpose programming language, it includes many elements that you wouldn’t associate

157

158 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

specifically with printing such as data types (numbers, arrays, and strings) and control primitives (conditionals, loops,
and procedures). It also has an interesting feature called dictionary, which stores information in a table consisting of a
collection of key and value pairs. The values can be entered into the dictionary while the keys are used to reference
the information needed. These features made possible documents that acted like an application which could generate
pages dynamically from data directly on the printer itself. These printer-based applications were stored temporarily in
memory or permanently in the printer’s hard drive, and triggered by a command in the print stream. These capabilities
made variable data printing possible using PostScript and are still being used today for that purpose.
The first printer to use PostScript was the Apple LaserWriter in 1985. The same day that Apple announced the
LaserWriter, Aldus Corporation announced PageMaker, a page layout application developed to take advantage of the
Apple Macintosh computer’s GUI (graphical user interface) and the PostScript PDL. This series of events is considered
by many as the genesis of the desktop publishing revolution. In fact, the term desktop publishing is attributed to the
founder of Aldus Corporation.
PDF
Portable document format (PDF) is one of the most popular file formats for displaying and printing documents. When
this format was released by Adobe in 1993, it shared many of the same concepts and components of PostScript. But
where PostScript was designed primarily to provide device independent consistency in print output, PDF was focused
on maintaining the visual appearance of a document onscreen, independent of the operating system displaying it. Over
the years, PDF has expanded to more specific-use specifications for engineering, archiving, health care, universal access,
and printing.
PDF/X is a branch of PDF and an ISO standard that deals specifically with print. It was developed by the Committee for
Graphic Arts Technologies Standards (CGATS). Table 6.5 shows the evolution of the standard.

Submitting documents for print using one of these standards is highly recommended as it eliminates many of the causes
of print issues and is a more reliable method for graphics file exchange.
Digital Front End
Digital front end (DFE) describes the combination of hardware and software that drives and manages a print device.
Hardware is often custom built for this specific purpose and may have proprietary video interfaces that connect directly
to the print engine. An operating system serves as the base for the software components of the DFE and is often

160 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

Microsoft Windows based or a Linux or Unix variant. Although the Windows running on a DFE is much the same as its
desktop counterpart, Linux- and Unix-based systems are often custom distributions that are compiled specifically for
the DFE.
One of the key components of a DFE is the raster image processor (RIP). The RIP refers to the software component
that interprets the PDL and performs the function of rendering or rasterizing the complete instructions into an image
or raster the print engine will reproduce. The term RIP is often used interchangeably with DFE. This may have been
accurate in the past when a DFE really only performed the ripping function and little else. Modern DFEs, however,
do much more. In fact, a DFE may contain multiple RIPs, and within those RIPs they can utilize the multi-threading
and processing power of modern computer hardware and operating systems to process many pages or channels
simultaneously. PostScript has been the defacto PDL in digital printing for many years but with the development of the
PDF/X print standards and the subsequent release of the Adobe PDF Print Engine (APPE), a native PDF RIP, many DFEs
now include both PostScript and APPE as their available RIP engines.
ICC-based colour management workflow may be part of the RIP process or can be an independent component of the
DFE. Different elements within a print file get processed through their respective channels in the colour management
system. Common channels include CMYK, RGB, black, and named colours. The idea is to convert all colour elements
into the colour gamut of the print engine’s colorants/paper combination. The conversion process can be complicated,
but the basic concept is device dependent source colour spaces (CMYK, RGB, etc.) are converted to a device independent
colour space, referred to the profile conversion space (PSC), then from the PSC to the output gamut defined in the
output ICC profile. The idea is to take the source ‘recipe’ and define the visual appearance of it first. That is why it
needs to convert to device independent colour space, which defines the visual appearance of colour. Once the visual
appearance is defined, the ‘recipe’ for the specific output can be calculated.
Systems that support named or spot colour rendering follow a similar process. The named colour is located in a look up
table. The name must match perfectly, including punctuation, spaces, and case. Each named colour is defined in a device
independent colour space, typically Lab. There is no calculation in this step. The last step is the same; Lab values are
then converted via the output profile.
There is one more calculation applied before passing the information through to the printer. Electrophotography is
affected by rapid changes in humidity and temperature. The electrophotographic process relies on components that do
become less effective over time and use. These factors all affect the colour output. Calibration should be performed on
a regular basis to compensate for these variables. Calibration is a process of creating a correction curve to maintain
consistent and repeatable print output. This correction curve is applied right after the conversion to output profile,
ensuring output is consistent with what was defined in the output profile itself.
In order to maintain all these aspects of the DFE, an intuitive and user-friendly interface is critical. The user interface
includes many components. Here is where you would configure the DFE, find the status of the print device and
consumables, view and process jobs and job queues, and examine and export job histories and logs. Many WYSIWYG
tools are accessed via the user interface, such as those for workflow, imposition, complex job composition, paper
libraries, spot colour refinement, the launching of external tools, and even interfaces into other systems such as
web2print. DFEs are becoming more powerful and perform more than just the traditional RIP functions. As the digital
print industry continues to evolve, DFEs will be called on to perform more duties and functions. User interfaces will
need to evolve as well to maintain usability and stay intuitive.

6.7 Variable Data Printing
Roberto Medeiros

Variable data printing, or VDP, refers to a special form of digital printing where document content is determined by
entries in a record or data set and can be highly personalized. Varied text, graphics, and images are typical content
elements, but layout, element positioning, and even document choice are just some of the other variables. Because the
content on the printed page is constantly changing, it would not be feasible to produce this type of print product with
traditional offset lithography or with any other process that requires a fixed image plate. Electrophotographic and ink
jet printing are ideally suited for this type of printing as each page is imaged individually.
VDP can take many forms. Transactional documents like invoices and statements are probably the oldest form of
VDP, but these have evolved to include marketing or informational content. This is known as trans-promo or transpromotional. A mail merge is a simple form of VDP where a static document has data elements added directly to
it. Each record in the data set produces one document. Another VDP form is when you enter the record manually
or upload a simple text-based data table, which then fills the content of a template. This method is typically found in
web2print solutions and produces items such as business cards, where the layout, fonts, and required elements can
be predetermined and the content based on the data entered. More advanced VDP solutions may include campaign
management tools, workflow management, two-dimensional barcode generation, image-based font technology, and
integration into external systems such as databases, email, web2print solutions, data cleansing, or postal optimization
solutions.
One of the core purposes of VDP is to increase response rate and, ultimately, conversions to the desired outcome. In
order to accomplish this, it is critical that the content presented is relevant and has value for the intended audience.
Today, there are massive amounts of data available on customers and their behaviour. Analyzing and understanding
customer data is essential to maintaining a high degree of relevancy and engagement with the customer.
VDP can be broken down into six key components: data, content, business rules, layout, software, and output method.
Each component can vary in complexity and capability and may require advanced software solutions to implement.
However, even the most basic tools can produce highly effective communications.
Data
Data used for VDP can be simply thought of as a table or data set. Each row in the table is considered a single record.
The columns are the fields used to describe the contents of the record. Some examples of columns or fields would be
first name, last name, address, city, and so on. The simplest and most common form of representing this table is by using
a delimited plain text format like comma separated value (CSV) or tab delimited. The delimiter separates the columns
from one another and a new line represents a new row or record in the table. Here is an example of CSV data:
“FirstName”,”LastName”,”Gender”,”Age”,”FavQuotes”
“John”,”Smith”,”M”,”47”,”Do or do not, there is no try.”
“Mary”,”Jones”,”F”,”25”,”Grey is my favourite colour.”

161

162 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

The first row contains the row headers or what the fields represent and is not considered a record. You’ll notice that each
field is separated by a comma but is also enclosed within quotes. The quotes are text qualifiers and are commonly used
to prevent issues when the delimiting character may also be in the contents of the field as is the case with the first record
above. Many VDP applications support more advanced, relational databases like SQL, but a query must be performed
to extract the data to be used, which ultimately results in the same row and column record structure. The data must be
attached or assigned to the document in the page layout or VDP application.
Content
Content refers to elements displayed on each page. This would include text, graphics, and images, both static and
dynamic. Dynamic content uses placeholders, typically named by the column headers of the data, to mark the position
of the element and reference the data in the specific column of the current record. When the document is rendered, the
placeholder is replaced by the record data element.
“Dear <<FirstName>>…” becomes “Dear John…” when the document is rendered for the first record and “Dear Mary…”
for the second record, and so on. A complete document is rendered per record in the dataset.
Business Rules
Business rules are one of the key elements that make VDP documents highly useful. They can be thought of as a
series of criteria that are checked against the data to determine what gets displayed on the page. They can also be
used to manipulate the data or filter out relevant content. In almost every case, some level of scripting is required.
Advanced VDP solutions have built-in scripting capability, utilizing either common scripting language such as VBScript
or JavaScript, or a proprietary scripting language that is only applicable in that specific application. If the page layout
tool you are using to create your VDP document does not have scripting capability, you can apply business rules to data
beforehand in a spreadsheet application like Microsoft Excel or even Google Sheets.

Figure 6.11 Logical test

One of the most common methods for implementing a business rule is using a conditional or IF statement comprising
a logical test, an action for a ‘true’ result, and an action for a ‘false’ result (see Figure 6.11).
The logical_test means that the answer will be either true or false. In this case, we want to change our graphics based on gender.
In plain English, you may say:
“IF gender is male, THEN use plane_blue.tif, or ELSE use plane_orange.tif”
In scripting, it would look something like this:
IF(Gender=”male”,”plane_blue.tif”,”plane_red.tif”)

6.7 VARIABLE DATA PRINTING • 163

When doing this in a spreadsheet, you would enter the script in a cell in a new column. The result of the script is
displayed in the cell, not the script itself. This new column could now be used to specify the content to be displayed in
your layout application. In dedicated VDP applications, the script is attached to the object itself and is processed and
displayed in real time.

Figure 6.12 Plane blue

The “@Plane” column was added to dynamically change a graphic based on the contents of the cell in the “Gender” column (B2)
(see Figure 6.12).
Business rules can also be applied to the VDP workflow. In this case, the workflow application or component can
manipulate the data before applying it to a document, or it can select the document or destination to be used for the
record and much, much more.
Layout
When working with variable data documents, there are special layout considerations you should be aware of. Because
word lengths will change per record, there needs to be sufficient space to accommodate the largest and smallest record,
and prevent oversetting while maintaining the desired visual appearance. This challenge is compounded by the prolific
use of proportional fonts. Character widths differ with each letter so word lengths will vary even when the number
of characters is the same. This can also force a paragraph to reflow onto another page and change the number of pages
in the document. Additional scripting may be required to handle reflow scenarios. Some applications use special copyfitting algorithms to dynamically fit text into a defined area. The use of tables for layout purposes can also be helpful.
Because we are dealing with dynamically generated documents, we may also want to vary the images. Using images
with a consistent size and shape make it easier to work with. Transactional documents, such as statements and invoices,
extensively use numbers. Most fonts, including proportional ones, keep numbers mono-spaced. In other words, every
number character occupies the same amount of space. This is important because, visually, we want numbers to be right

164 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

justified and lining up vertically in columns with the decimal points aligned. There are, however, some fonts that do not
follow this common practice. These fonts may be suitable for use in a paragraph but are not for displaying financial data.
Software
Software that can generate a data-driven document is required for variable data printing. In the early days of VDP,
there weren’t many choices for designers. It was common practice to hand code VDP in PostScript, since it was both
a programming language and a PDL. Applications like PageMaker and Illustrator were PostScript design applications
but lacked VDP capabilities. Applications like PlanetPress emerged as dedicated PostScript VDP applications. Today,
designers have a wide variety of software available for creating VDP. There are three basic VDP software types: a builtin function within a page layout or word-processing software, a third-party plug-in, or a dedicated VDP application.
Microsoft Word, for example, has a mail merge function but does not have the ability to vary images, just text. Adobe
InDesign has the data merge function, which is basically a mail merge but includes the ability to vary images as well. In
both these examples, business rules would be applied to the data prior to using it in these applications.
There are a number of plug-ins available for InDesign that are very sophisticated. These leverage the extensive page
layout capability of InDesign while adding scripting and other VDP specific capabilities. XMPie and DesignMerge are
examples of these types of plug-ins. FusionPro is another plug-in based VDP product, and while it does have an InDesign
plug-in, it only uses this to allocate variable text and image boxes in the layout. Business rules and specific content are
applied in its complement plug-in for Adobe Acrobat.
PlanetPress and PrintShop Mail are examples of dedicated applications that combine both page layout and VDP
functions. Although they are very strong in VDP functionality, they sometimes lack the sophistication you’d find in
InDesign when it comes to page layout. These particular applications have recently moved from PostScript-based VDP
to a more modern HTML5 and CSS (cascading style sheets) base, making it easier to produce and distribute data-driven
documents for multi-channel communications.
Output Method
The ‘P’ in VDP stands for printing and is the main output method we will discuss here. However, document
personalization and data-driven communications have evolved to also include email, fax, web (PURL, personalized
landing page), SMS text messaging, and responsive design for various mobile device screen sizes. With the emergence
of quick response (QR) codes, even printed communications can tap into rich content and add additional value to the
piece. In order to take advantage of these additional distribution and communications channels, a workflow component
is often employed.
A key element for optimized print output of VDP documents is caching. This is where the printer’s RIP caches or stores
repeatable elements in print-ready raster format. This means the RIP processes these repeating elements once, and
then reuses these preprocessed elements whenever the document calls for them. This does require a RIP with enough
power to process large amounts of data and resources with support for the caching scheme defined in the VDP file but,
ultimately, allows the printer to print at its full rated speed without having to wait for raster data from the RIP.
There have been many proprietary VDP file formats that have striven to improve performance of VDP over the
years, but the industry is moving rapidly toward more open standards. PODi, a not-for-profit consortium of leading
companies in digital printing, is leading the way with two widely adopted open VDP standards. These standards are
PPML (Personalized Print Markup Language) and PDF/VT (portable document format/variable transactional).

6.7 VARIABLE DATA PRINTING • 165

PPML
PPML, first introduced in 2000, is a device independent XML-based printing language. There are two types of PPML:
thin and thick. Thin PPML is a single file, with the .ppml extension, containing all the instructions necessary for
producing the VDP document. It does include caching instructions; however, all resources such as fonts or images
are stored externally of the file. The path to these resources is defined in the RIP and retrieved during the rendering
process of the document. Thin PPML is ideal for in-house VDP development where resources may be shared by multiple
projects. These files are extremely small, however, and network speed and bandwidth may affect performance and are
more difficult to implement if using an external print provider. Thick PPML is a .zip file containing all the required
resources (fonts, images, instructions, etc.). This format makes the file highly portable and easy to implement on the
print device, but it has a larger file size when compared to thin PPML. RIPs that support the PPML format can import
the .zip file directly. Regardless of the type used, PPML benefits from exceptional performance, an open standard, open
job ticketing support ( JDF), and overall reduced file size. To generate PPML, an advanced VDP solution is required.
PDF/VT
PDF/VT is a relatively new international standard (ISO 16612-2) that has a lot of potential. It is built off the PDF/
X-4 standard, benefiting from its features, such as support for transparency, ICC-based colour management, extensive
metadata support, element caching, preflighting, and much more. In short, PDF/VT includes the mechanisms required
to handle VDP jobs in the same manner as static PDF printing allows print providers to use a common workflow for
all job types, including VDP. Many of the latest releases of advanced VDP solutions already support PDF/VT as well as
many DFE manufacturers.

6.8 Summary
Roberto Medeiros

Digital printing encompasses a number of technologies that each has unique characteristics, strengths, and applications.
Digital imaging may even be the only print method able to produce a certain type of work, as is the case with VDP.
Paper is also a major factor in the success of a project. Your paper choice can convey a message or set a tone as much as
the content printed on it. Having a good understanding of technology and paper fundamentals can go along way when
making choices for producing your print project.

As modern modes of communication are constantly changing, the print industry has had to become very competitive.
Successful print companies have evolved beyond producing only printed products; today, they also provide other
services geared to an electronic marketplace. With the ever-growing number of people going online, customers have
adapted to having instant information (Poon & Swatman, 1995), which printers can now provide. One such service is
web2print. Customers benefit from the ease of ordering print anywhere around the world, with quicker turnaround
times than traditional methods. Print companies benefit by building a larger customer base, streamlining workflows,
and reducing production costs — all while staying competitive.
Print has traditionally been a service requiring many human touch-points, but with advances in business
communication over the Internet, the dynamics of custom manufacturing are changing, particularly with respect
to the ordering process (Shim, Pendyala, Sundaram, & Gao, 2000). Putting an effective online service in place involves
strategically selecting suitable products and services. Online ordering is not ideal for every print product, but rather for
specific products that are unnecessarily labour intensive. Products that were once very labour intensive, such as business
cards, can now be ordered online. Customers enter their information directly into a template on screen while they sit
in their own offices. A print-ready PDF file enters an automated folder in the print company (called a hot folder) and
moves into the print workflow, allowing for a fully automated process called lights-out prepress, which saves on labour
and allows for greater profits. Web2print provides a client company a value-added feature, while improving workflow
process for the print company.
Technology Is the Key
Web2print completely automates the print ordering process by integrating online orders with print production. Using
the Internet automates order entry and provides time savings to both the customer and the company.
Electronic commerce offers the possibility of breakthrough changes: changes that so radically alter customer

169

170 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

expectations that they redefine the market or create entirely new markets (Gunasekaran, Marri, McGaughey,
& Nebhwani, 2002, p. 195).
This technology allows businesses to interact with customers in a new way in addition to more traditional forms of
ordering such as email, file transfer protocol (FTP), phone, fax, and face-to-face meetings. While web2print removes
the need for more traditional ways of ordering, it does not replace them. Some customers may prefer these ways
because they may not know, or be comfortable with, the online options that are increasingly available to them. It
is advantageous to a company to inform and educate customers, encouraging them to evolve their buying habits.
Traditionally, purchasing involved gaining knowledge about print companies through their sales reps, selecting the
appropriate company, and trusting that the sales rep would ensure the product was delivered on time and for the best
price. Today, many customers use search engines to obtain information about and decide on which print company to
use. Using web2print ensures that the production time frame and the price match what a customer is looking for.
A printing company has to work with and implement many complex and interconnected systems in order to generate
a printed product. From the inception of a new item to its delivery to the end-user, there are many opportunities for
streamlining. Web2print creates efficiencies at the beginning of the print process, and those benefits trickle all the way
through to imaging. The ultimate goal is for the data collected from the customer to proceed directly to the raster image
processor (RIP) that drives the production process. A print company that takes advantage of this type of automation is
positioning itself for smoother and more cost-effective print runs.

7.2 E-commerce for Print Manufacturing
Steve Tomljanovic

E-commerce is by definition the buying and selling of goods online. Print companies are turning to e-commerce to
target the ever-growing number of people who want self-service and a more convenient way to purchase products in
their busy lives. Today, many customers are online and the number of users purchasing goods through the Internet is
growing substantially (Statistics Canada, 2014). The ability to offer an effective e-commerce service for ordering can put
a print company ahead of its competitors. This approach challenges traditional thinking that a printer is only a bricksand-mortar or face-to-face business. As more and more businesses move online to satisfy their customers’ procurement
needs, so must print companies (Supply Management, 2014).
A print company should transition with its customers to stay ahead of the competition. E-commerce allows a customer
to order any product 24/7 without having to leave the office or pick up the phone. Providing online ordering has other
benefits besides increased sales. It can help a company gain more knowledge about its customers and track purchasing
trends. As well, online ordering allows print companies to offer customers additional products and services that may
not come up in discussions during traditional forms of print procurement.
Not all business can be conducted online, as the more complex a project is the more a company will benefit from
offering its services and expertise in traditional face-to-face communications. However, the ability to stay ahead of the
competition by using Internet technologies helps solidify a company’s relationship with its customers. For example,
even if customers are buying products offline, they are likely doing their research online first. Therefore, a company can
use the valuable data generated during this research to greatly improve its ability to evaluate and manage its business.
When customers place orders, companies can analyze the frequency of those orders, their customers’ buying trends,
and which products are more successful than others. Data-gathering is the most important advantage online ordering
has over traditional offline ordering. Using an e-commerce system allows a print company to learn more about what,
when, and how customers are ordering. Online technologies enable a company to broaden the products and services it
provides more than ever before.

Templated Variable Data Printing
Templated variable data technology allows a customer to produce a product using a template-driven order-entry system.
These templates are used most frequently through an e-commerce store. A variable template allows the user to control
the information made available on a product and see the real-time end result. Variable data entry is an ideal solution for
direct mailers, promotional flyers, event posters, and stationery. Variable data allows for the custom printing of one-ofa-kind pieces that are unique to the targeted market. The potential for variable data is endless and is only limited by the
imagination behind a design.
Variable data is not limited to digital presses, as many lithography presses can incorporate designs with the simple swap
of a plate. It is common for companies ordering large quantities of business cards to print blank shells on which they can
later imprint a person’s information. A print company obtains this information by having the customer use a variable
template, which is then uniquely created to ensure all branding standards are consistent. This allows any employee of
the client company to order business cards and stay true to the brand. The person fills out his or her name, title, and
phone and email contact information, then views the result on a soft-proof. Then the person simply submits the card

171

172 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

through a shopping cart system, eliminating the need for multiple communications, and making production efficient by
having fewer hands touch the project.
The Benefits to a Print Company
Web2print has multiple benefits for a print company. Software can automate tasks, eliminating the need for staff to
touch a project, which makes the service profitable. Allowing the customer to create a print-ready PDF is an asset, not
a loss of control, as it allows the customer to assume responsibility for any typos or errors. Web2print also makes the
production process much faster and efficient by automating time-consuming steps, and most importantly, helps build
solid rapport and customer loyalty.
Once a PDF is ordered, a job ticket (called a docket) is automatically generated containing all of the order specifications,
including pricing. The PDF then travels to a hot folder where it is accessed by the imposition software, which imposes
it onto a press sheet. The press sheet either goes straight to the digital press to be printed or to the plate setter if it is
being printed by conventional lithography. The whole process is extremely efficient and takes considerably less time to
complete than having staff continually involved as the PDF travels through their departments.
The Benefits to the Customer
Web2print is all about customer satisfaction. That should be the top priority when a print company creates customized
online storefronts and variable templates. Customers no longer have to call or physically meet a sales rep, as they now
have the ability to order their printed materials at any time of the day and from anywhere. Today, many customers do
not sit behind a desk for their entire workday, and establishing an online service allows a company to target those onthe-go customers who need to order print.
Companies can track orders in real time, which helps them predict future buying trends. This is especially beneficial
to customers wanting to print blank items, otherwise known as shells. Using this information, a company can help a
customer determine how many shells to print in the next run.
Business Models: Licensed or Subscribed Software
Web2print services come in two primary types: licensed software and subscribed software. Licensed software allows
a print company to own the technology by paying an upfront fee; subscription-based software typically requires a
company to pay a monthly or yearly fee to use the software.
Licensed software strategies typically represent a large cash outflow up front. The company can then use the software to
create as many portals or implementations as it wishes. While the software is supported through a licence, it is expected
that the company will maintain its own web presence, and therefore may require highly trained web developers or
programmers. The outlay of expense is gradually recouped over time through increased user implementation.
The subscription model, also referred to as SaaS (software as a service) reduces a company’s support and maintenance
costs up front. Saas allows adding new print products to move forward more quickly because the need to support the
same version throughout computers internally is removed. All subscribers operate on the same version at the same time,
and are upgraded regularly at the same time. Because the Internet is constantly evolving, the SaaS model is flexible and
better aligned to move with it. This business model contributes to a company’s return on investment (ROI) as well. Since
a company typically doesn’t pay a large sum of money upfront for the software, it can easily budget for payments based
on monthly usage. The company only pays for the services it uses. This business model builds a partnership between the

7.2 E-COMMERCE FOR PRINT MANUFACTURING • 173

print company and its SaaS vendor, and a positive ROI is beneficial to both parties in the partnership because it keeps
both vendor and subscriber focused on mutual success.

7.3 Web2print Strategies and Goals
Steve Tomljanovic

Evaluating Strategies and Setting Goals
Print companies must have clear strategies and goals to ensure continued success when implementing web2print. The
first step is to evaluate the type of sales they make. There are two basic types of sales a print company makes: business
to business (B2B) and business to consumer (B2C). It is very common for a printing company to serve a primarily B2B
customer base; however, since B2C requires a vastly different storefront, this decision needs to be made early in the
process of implementing web2print.
Once a print company determines the type of storefront its customers need, it should research the three basic types
of service: print on demand (POD), variable data printing (VDP), and static warehoused items. By analyzing its target
market, a print company can determine which of these services customers will use most. Once the print company
chooses a software vendor that can provide the most suitable storefront, only then can it decide on the specific services
to offer each of its customers.
Therefore, to be successful, a print company must:
•
•
•
•

Know the target market
Choose an appopriate vendor and storefront
Make plans to add new customers to the system by setting goals
Choose the types of products to offer to each customer based on need

Know the Target Market
Every print company has a different customer base, and thus serves a different market. A print company must analyze
the customers it serves to determine exactly what its target market is. The biggest mistake print companies make
when committing to the purchase of an online ordering system is not researching the technology in relation to their
target market. Print companies should choose the system that best suits their needs and benefits their customers. There
are hundreds of vendors and products with thousands of features, so print companies need a strategy to ensure they can
maximize their return on investment (ROI) while providing the best possible services to their specific, targeted customer
base.
Choosing a Digital Storefront and Variable Software
Since not all vendors of e-commerce systems are the same, print companies need to exercise due diligence in making
their choice of vendor. They should analyze their own internal workflow to ensure they find a vendor that best meets
their specific needs. As well, print companies should determine what their employees’ strengths are and ensure the
appropriate staff are hired to accommodate online needs. Staff involved in the implementation and operation of an ecommerce ordering system need a basic knowledge of many web-based programming languages in order to give them
a good grasp of the back-end coding necessary to build and maintain the online system. Every online ordering system
uses its own method of coding to create its storefronts and templates, so having previous programming knowledge is a
major asset.

174

7.3 WEB2PRINT STRATEGIES AND GOALS • 175

Many companies such as IBM, HP, Creo, and EFI are building platforms to provide VDP service to print companies.
The software these companies provide creates a web2print workflow. This includes the internal processes needed
to print a job, as well as a client-facing website, from which customers can order. It is important to understand the
benefits of every digital storefront as they all offer different options. Digital storefronts must provide a simple ordering
process for the customer while being very robust and efficient for the print company. Selecting the order quantity and
displaying pricing should be simple and not confusing for the end-user. Customizing VDP products or ordering POD
or warehoused items should be simple and quick. The ability to split products for multiple-shipping destinations should
also be considered.
Selecting a storefront that can be integrated into a management information system (MIS) to streamline orders from
customization to invoicing is beneficial. The ability to have customers approve or reject orders placed by others is also
beneficial, as it allows for an extra review to ensure order information is correct.
To ensure they make appropriate choices, print companies request copies of documentation from a software provider
to see what they need to learn if they plan to be a self-service user of the software. They request references and ask
how the software provider handles support, system outages, and upgrade development to get a sense of how other users
perceive the company. Print companies attend demonstrations of the product and give specifics on what they want to
hear beyond the generic sales pitch. Print companies also seek specific information about short- and long-term product
upgrades, which gives them a chance to glimpse the software company’s strategic vision and how the product might
develop in the future.
Other Considerations Before Purchasing
Print companies take other considerations into account before purchasing software.
Usability: If they have current B2B customers, print companies ask them to test the software before committing to a
purchase. If these end-users have difficulty using the software, then it is not the right choice. If print companies have
B2C customers, they ask someone without any print knowledge or experience to test the product. Testing against online
competitors to see how the software compares is another way print companies assess the usability of a product. They
also research customer feedback.
Partnership compatibility: The relationship between a print company and a software provider is a partnership, not just
a sales interaction. Print companies are in frequent contact with their software provider to solve technical difficulties,
arrange training, or add improved services. Therefore, determining if the software provider will make a compatible
partner is important. Print companies don’t rely solely on what the sales rep tells them; they try to get a sense of
the software provider’s team by calling the support desk and talking to customer service. This helps print companies
determine how well they will be treated and whether the software provider’s staff are knowledgeable.
Features: Assessing software features is usually part of the decision-making process. Print companies generally want to
know the following before purchasing:
• How easily will customers understand and use the software’s features in a self-service situation?
• Was the software built to support the print industry or first created for some other use and applied to the
print industry? If the former, are the features transferable?
• Do the features allow set up and administration of the site, creation of B2B storefronts, and product
development. Do they enable the print company to add variable elements, create users, and take orders
without relying on the software provider?
An important tip when choosing software technology is to not put too much emphasis on the number of features

176 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

offered. Features tend to constantly change, and more does not necessarily mean better. While software product
development tends to centre on adding more features, it is not necessarily adding more value. If a feature is added to
a product, but is never used by customers, it is possible that the feature did nothing more than add complexity to the
ordering process. Such a feature may result in discouraging customers from using the system, or placing future orders.
Starting with a New Customer
One way to introduce a new customer to web2print is to build a single item for them. This allows the customer to
learn the ordering process and the print company to learn and incorporate the customer’s products into a production
workflow. A workflow should be designed to be as automated as possible, from order entry to production to invoicing.
New workflows should include sufficient time to allow a customer to test the variable templates to extremes, entering
best- and worst-case scenarios to ensure the template can perform in all situations without errors. Only once the initial
workflow has been proven to be efficient should more products be added to the storefront. This ensures that both the
customer (external activity) and the print company (internal activity) are confident enough in the workflow to handle
more orders.
Setting Goals and Site Testing
Printing companies should allow time to educate their customers in all steps of the process when launching an ecommerce system or when adding a new variable-template-driven item. The easiest way to meet customer expectations
is to involve them in the development process, regularly inviting feedback and eliciting suggestions for improvement.
Customer satisfaction is important, so a company must ensure that it takes client feedback seriously, incorporating
customer input to improve the service process. As the site is being developed, both the programmer and the customer
need to rigorously test new products and templates to ensure they are completely satisfied long before allowing product
ordering. It is common for a programmer to envision how a template will behave, while the customer intends it to
behave in a different way. Often a customer has expectations that the programmer may not have foreseen. Once the
entire site, including products and templates, has been developed, it still isn’t ready. A testing phase or pilot period
is necessary to find any other bugs or shortcomings that may be more easily discovered once real data is being used.
Implementing a pilot period before an official launch of the full workflow also allows everyone to learn how the system
will impact them, exposes potential workflow issues (which can arise in the many steps between ordering and invoicing),
and allows the customer to provide final feedback.
Most important to keep in mind is that the system only works when customers use it. They will often find opportunities
during the pilot period to suggest where the process can be improved, as unforeseen problems are discovered only after
people start using a new system or variable template. Often these user-experience issues can prevent adoption of the
system by the customer. As well, customers may fall back to the more familiar method of traditionally ordering print
if they do feel comfortable using the new system. Including the customer in the entire process allows for the greatest
chance of success, and is the best way to ensure the success of the site.
Choosing the Right Type of Products
Before setting out to create products, a print company should determine whether it is a variable template, a print-ondemand piece, or a warehoused item. Other key information needed is the name of the product and the communication
intent (i.e., Is the piece promotional or educational? What audience is it intended to reach? How knowledgeable is
this audience?). Print companies also need to know whether the product will be ordered regularly or be a one-time
communication. It is important to choose the right products before the development phase begins. It is common for a
product to be almost completely programmed before it is discovered that another similar product would have been more

7.3 WEB2PRINT STRATEGIES AND GOALS • 177

appropriate. Below are explanations of the three most common types of products, followed by a list of more specific
options.
Variable Templates

Variable templates contain all the necessary information for a customer to customize and soft-proof a print order. This
usually results in the creation of an automated, print-ready PDF, which is generated while the customer is still online.
A PDF of the design is created containing variable fields assigned for every element. Coding is then applied to each
field to determine how the template will behave under given circumstances, such as during customization. For example,
coding can force a name to be upper case or email to be lower case. Coding can also be used to upload custom images
or force phone numbers to use hyphens (e.g., 604-123-4567) instead of dots (e.g., 604.123.1234). Coding is critical for
keeping a customer’s brand consistent, so regardless of who creates an order, all products will be formatted consistently
and have the same look.
Deciding which VDP software or plug-in is more appropriate and how it interacts with the digital storefront is
important. VDP software comes in the form of third-party applications such as XMPie or is accessed online through a
self-hosted dashboard.
Print on Demand

POD products are the opposite of VDP products. POD allows the customer to order a static product to be printed and
shipped. POD products do not require customization and are printed using a completed file uploaded by the customer
or stored in the system by the programmer.
Warehousing

Storefronts can act as an inventory management system for any products that can be warehoused. These products can
be ordered online using the same process as a POD item. Each product has a real-time inventory count associated with
it, which updates after every order. Notifications can be sent about low product inventory levels, reminding a customer
that a product needs to be replenished. Inventory counts benefit customers by showing their buying patterns, which
helps them to effectively determine future quantities.
Below are other examples of different types of products that can be ordered online:
• Ad hoc print: an online print product where the customer provides the content during the ordering process
via file upload, such as brochures, flyers, and newsletters.
• Ad hoc business documents: an online print product where the customer provides the content during the
ordering process via file upload, such as training manuals, presentations, and reports.
• Ad hoc oversize: An online print product where the customer provides the content during the ordering
process via file upload, such as posters, signs, and banners.
• Static print product: An online print product where the content is stored in a catalogue and printed on
demand after ordering, such as sales sheets, flyers, and white papers.
• Inventory product: An online print product where the content is stored in a catalogue and pulled from existing
inventory after ordering.
• Digital publishing: An online product where the final product is a downloadable PDF instead of a printed
product, such as white papers, personalized sales materials, and presentations.

178 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

• Kit: An online print product where the customer can buy a basket of goods contained in a single item.
• Promo product: A set of products that are branded with a logo for use in marketing or promotional programs,
such as mugs, baseball hats, and pens.
• Integrated campaign: A product that combines multiple-marketing channels to create an integrated campaign
a customer can use to track metrics when launching a new product or sales promotion.
• Photo product: An online print product using uploaded photos or photos from online collections, such as
photo books, photo cards, and photo calendars.
• Quote request: An online print product used to request a quote for a print job.

7.4 Implementation and Workflow Considerations
Steve Tomljanovic

Implementation and Deployment
By this point, the workflow strategy has been created, the customer has been included in discussions about its goals,
and the print company has created some sample products and print items for the customer to test. As well, the print
company and customer have completed a pilot period and identified unforeseen workflow issues. What remains is the
final step of making the site live.
Making the site live involves ‘turning it on’ to accept orders from the entire user base. If the above steps have been
completed properly, there should be very few issues.
Continuous Assessment
Even after a storefront has been launched, it is not considered complete. There should always be a system of continuous
assessment in place to respond to customer feedback and correct any errors as the orders start coming in. Even after
the site is live, the programmer should navigate the storefront to ensure its usability, and place a test order to ensure no
issues arise for the customer during the ordering process. Also of consideration is a post-order assessment, where the
internal processes in the printing company are evaluated for completeness and efficiency, as outlined below.
Workflows and Automation
Orders should enter an automated workflow, creating a seamless transition while bypassing several departments. Once
an order has been placed, the appropriate staff are notified to fulfill it. If a VDP product was customized, then a printready PDF should automatically be uploaded to a hot folder. At this point, either an automated system or a prepress
operator reviews the file for print standards and imposes it on the print template. These files can then be automatically
produced on a digital press or be sent to the plate setter to be prepared for litho printing. Throughout every step of the
process, email notifications should be sent to appropriate staff so they can fulfill the order, and to the customer so they
can be kept informed of anything related to the order such as invoices and product shipping.
MIS Integration
It is beneficial to select a storefront suitable for integration into a management information system (MIS) to streamline
orders from customization to invoice. Integration is a connection between two systems that enables the exchange
of data. The information is automatically entered into an electronic docket, which is a database that collects and
maintains customer information, products ordered, shipping information, and billing information automatically. When
integrating two systems, it is important to note which system is the master data holder and which is the subscriber to
that data. Only one digital system should ‘hold’ the data, whereas all the other systems access the same database. In a
print environment with a functioning print MIS system, it is the MIS system that should be considered to be the master
in every case. The MIS system collects orders from everywhere, not just the orders placed through storefronts online.
The web2print system pushes data into the MIS system and subscribes to the master data stored and managed in that

179

180 • GRAPHIC DESIGN AND PRINT PRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS

system, such as pricing and job specifications. This can be challenging because the web2print software and the print
MIS system are often provided by separate vendors, which can prevent a smooth exchange of data.
Web2print is one of many secondary, or subscriber, connections into a printer’s business and production workflow.
Web2print should serve its main purpose, which is to capture orders in the most efficient manner while maintaining
a competitive edge for a print company’s sales team. Orders must be transitioned seamlessly and smoothly into the
production workflow and MIS system so they can be treated like any other order, whether they were placed online or
by traditional means. In this way, web2print is regarded as only one of many business opportunities that bring sales to a
print company.
Analyzing the ROI
When making any business decision, investment must be weighed against return. This is known as return on investment,
or ROI. Moving a business online to accept orders is a serious business decision. Web2print can be a worthwhile
investment and understanding how to measure ROI before investing in a vendor’s software is important.
Typically, in a print company, the estimate for the actual printing process is very well defined. The estimating
department can provide detailed analysis of all of the costs associated with printing a specific printed product. Where
web2print differs, however, is in the costs of capturing the sale and in streamlining the process in the print shop. For
example, there are specific increased costs in running a web2print site online. If the system was paid for as a one-time
licence, then the total cost must be amortized over the life of the licence, and each print order shares a small part of that
overall cost. Some SaaS systems, on the other hand, charge a piece rate or a monthly fee. These are easier to incorporate
into the costs of the job. On the savings side, there are processes within the print company that are made more efficient,
so an analysis of cost savings can be made there as well. However, print companies should not fall into the trap of
thinking that just because a print job can be completed in a shorter time, it is automatically cheaper to produce. In order
to assess the total ROI, only real costs that affect the print product’s profitability should be assessed.
Timing is important when calculating ROI because a printer must determine when to invest money based on an
expected return of that investment. Purchasing or building an online system is not automatically going to generate
revenue. It is likely that the print company could invest thousands of dollars very quickly before the system provides any
value in return. There is a human aspect to this as well. Sales professionals are still critical for driving new customer sales
to the web and finding new online opportunities, both of which will help improve the return on the initial investment.
Systems with monthly payments are sometimes better for new online ventures, as they do not require a huge investment
upfront. Up-front payments force a print company to give away all monetary leverage in a single transaction, and while
they might be more cost-effective when serving large numbers of customers, they can do serious financial damage in the
short term.

7.5 Summary
Steve Tomljanovic

Web2print is the online connection between a print company and its customers, and the technology should help to
solidify this relationship, not hinder it. Print companies offer their services online in response to their customers’ needs
and buying trends. As web2print becomes more integrated into a print company’s day-to-day business, it becomes a
main channel for interacting with a customer. A key to the strategy for implementing web services is involving the
customer as much as possible, since the customer’s use and acceptance of the ordering portal is critical for its success.
Print companies should research the types of products and services that will be helpful to customers in the specific
target markets they serve, and not add too many products too quickly. Print companies must analyze the types of
products their customer needs, and plan how a streamlined workflow will create efficiencies in its operations. Finally,
a pilot phase to assess both accuracy of the storefront and user experience is important. To ensure continued customer
satisfaction, print companies should be prepared to make ongoing improvements once the site goes live. System
integration with print companies’ internal processes is also ongoing, as efficiencies and production enhancements are
realized. The print industry continues to evolve and a successful implementation of a web2print portal will help print
companies keep up with this evolution and stay in front of the competition.
