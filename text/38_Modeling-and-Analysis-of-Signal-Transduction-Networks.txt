Preface
Biological pathways, such as signaling networks, are a key component of biological systems
of each living cell. In fact, malfunctions of signaling pathways are linked to a number of
diseases, and components of signaling pathways are used as potential drug targets. Elucidating
the dynamic behavior of the components of pathways, and their interactions, is one of the key
research areas of systems biology.
Biological signaling networks are characterized by a large number of components and an
even larger number of parameters describing the network. Furthermore, investigations of
signaling networks are characterized by large uncertainties of the network as well as limited
availability of data due to expensive and time-consuming experiments. As such, techniques
derived from systems analysis, e.g., sensitivity analysis, experimental design, and parameter
estimation, are important tools for elucidating the mechanisms involved in signaling networks.
This Special Issue contains papers that investigate a variety of different signaling networks via
established, as well as newly developed modeling and analysis techniques.

Integrated Computational Model of Intracellular Signaling
and microRNA Regulation Predicts the Network Balances
and Timing Constraints Critical to the Hepatic Stellate Cell
Activation Process
Lakshmi Kuttippurathu, Austin Parrish and Rajanikanth Vadigepalli
Abstract: Activation and deactivation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) is an important mechanism
contributing to both healthy liver function and development of liver diseases, which relies on the
interplay between numerous signaling pathways. There is accumulating evidence for the regulatory
role of microRNAs that are downstream from these pathways in HSC activation. However, the
relative contribution of these pathways and interacting microRNA regulators to the activation process
is unknown. We pursued a computational modeling approach to explore the timing and regulatory
balances that are critical to HSC activation and quiescence. We developed an integrated model
incorporating three signaling pathways with crosstalk (NF-țB, STAT3 and TGF-ȕ) and two
microRNAs (miR-146a, miR-21) that are differentially regulated by these pathways. Simulations
demonstrated that TGF-ȕ-mediated regulation of microRNAs is critical to drive the HSC phenotypic
switch from quiescence (miR-146ahigh miR-21low) to an activated state (miR-146alow miR-21high). We
found that the relative timing between peak NF-țB and STAT3 activation plays a key role driving
the initial dynamics of miR-146a. We observed re-quiescence from the activated HSC state upon
termination of cytokine stimuli. Our integrated model of signaling and microRNA regulation provides
a new computational platform for investigating the mechanisms driving HSC molecular state
phenotypes in normal and pathological liver physiology.

1. Introduction
Hepatic stellate cells (HSC), although important for many aspects of liver function in healthy
tissue, are primary drivers of liver diseases such as fibrosis and cirrhosis [1,2]. In healthy livers, the
main role of HSCs appears to be storage and transport of retinoids as well as modulating the innate
immune response [3–5]. Activation of HSCs occurs in response to numerous stimuli, including
induction of activating factors or loss of repressive signals due to genetic or post-transcriptional
regulation. During liver regeneration induced by chemical injury (e.g., CCl4 exposure) or partial
hepatectomy, HSCs activate and secrete several pro-regenerative proteins, including hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) [6–8]. During diseases associated with
chronic inflammation, HSCs alter their gene and protein expression profiles, change their
morphology, and deposit fibrous extracellular matrix (ECM), causing scarring and leading to fibrosis
and cirrhosis [1].

2
The process of HSC activation during chronic inflammation is governed by autocrine and
paracrine signaling factors from other non-parenchymal and parenchymal cells and is likely highly
dependent on the local microenvironment [2,9]. It is known that the initial changes in HSCs in
response to injury could be a result of paracrine stimulation from other non-parenchymal cells.
Several transcription factors play a role in HSC activation. To initiate HSC activation, inflammatory
molecules such as IL-1, IL-6, and TGF-ȕ bind to receptors on the stellate cell membrane [10]. The
presence of constitutive NF-țB activating inflammatory pathways has been reported in HSCs [11].
A recent study found IL-1 driven NF-țB inducing multiple MMPs provoking HSC activation [12].
IL-6 stimulation of STAT3 increases collagen production in HSCs leading to acceleration of fibrosis.
STAT3 directly up-regulates TGF-ȕ expression in HSCs [10]. TGF-ȕ initiates a signaling cascade
that results in the phosphorylation of SMAD2 (pSMAD2) and further upregulates SMAD7
expression. SMAD7 acts as an anti-fibrogenic factor through an auto-inhibitory feedback loop by
inhibiting TGF-ȕ mediated phosphorylation of SMAD2. This feedback loop leads to a restriction of
the intensity and duration of TGF-ȕ signaling [13]. pSMAD2 forms a complex with SMAD4 and the
complex translocates to the nucleus, after which they interact with other factors to regulate gene
expression of collagen and other fibrogenic factors [10,14]. Interaction between SMAD, NF-țB and
STAT3 pathways providing positive and negative feedback modulates HSC activation [4,10–12,14,15].
Increased TGF-ȕ expression, lead to increased ECM production by stellate cells and altered ECM
composition, with higher fraction of fibrous collagens and lower fractions of basement membrane
collagens Activation of HSCs also results in increased levels of growth factors (PDGF, EGF,
FGF-2, and others), which induce HSC proliferation, and increased levels of chemotactic proteins
(PDGF, MCP-1, CXCR3), which attract HSCs to an activation site [16]. Increased proliferation,
chemotaxis, and production of activating signals by active HSCs act as positive feedbacks to amplify
HSC activation once it has begun to occur in a subset of cells [2,8].
MicroRNAs are small, non-coding RNAs approximately 21 nucleotides in length which are
involved in the regulation of multiple cellular processes [17]. Recently, the role of microRNAs
governing the activation and function of HSCs has begun to be appreciated. Knockdown of miR-27a
and miR-27b in activated HSCs was shown to allow reversion to a quiescent phenotype [18].
miR-15b and miR-16 are known to be downregulated during the activation of HSCs [19]. Recent
studies have revealed the role of miR-29b in HSC activation [20]. Another microRNA, miR-146a,
has emerged as a potential modulator of HSC activation. miR-146a expression is shown to be
downregulated during rat HSC activation [21]. A recent in vitro study reported miR-146a expression
to be decreased by almost 17-fold in activated HSCs [22]. In contrast, when miR-146a was
overexpressed in activated HSCs in vitro, the cells appear to take on an anti-fibrotic phenotype,
expressing low mRNA levels of IL-6, high mRNA levels of basement collagen (Col1a1), and lower
levels of NF-țB binding activity (a mediator of inflammatory response). miR-21 is one of the
well-studied microRNAs that modulates cell cycle progression and proliferation during liver
regeneration. The role of miR-21 in hepatic stellate cell activation has also been studied [23]. Higher
expression of miR-21 and the existence of an auto-feedback loop connecting miR-21 to TGF-ȕ
pathway activation in activated HSCs have been reported [24]. In contrast to miR-146a, miR-21 has
been associated with increased cardiac fibrosis in vivo and increased ECM deposition in vitro [25].

3
In HSCs activated in vitro, miR-21 expression increased by over five-fold indicating that miR-21
may play a role modulating fibrosis in HSCs [22]. Several other papers have reported such a differential
activation of microRNAs miR-21 and miR-146a in the context of liver and other diseases [26–28].
Alterations in the relative balance between this pair of microRNAs, here termed “microRNA switch”,
can therefore act a marker for HSC activation state. Activated HSCs have a relatively high expression
of miR-21 to miR-146a, whereas quiescent HSCs have a low miR-21 to miR-146a ratio of expression.
In summary, the opposing expression and regulation of these microRNAs and their interaction with
the cytokine induced signaling pathways are associated with HSC activation. Therefore, we used
these two microRNAs as representative markers of HSC phenotype in our model and formulated our
analysis based on their differential regulation.
Although the microRNAs miR-146a and miR-21 appear to be useful as biomarkers for HSC
activation state, their role in HSC activation remains unclear. The dynamics of miR-21 and
miR-146a during HSC activation have not been fully characterized. Several feed forward and
feedback interactions between these microRNAs and signaling pathways have been demonstrated in
multiple studies [23,25,29,30]. The known interactions between signaling pathways and these
microRNAs lead to multiple possibilities for how these microRNA biomarkers likely vary during the
early stages of HSC activation. We pursued a computational model based approach to explore these
possibilities. Based on an array of in vitro and in vivo literature, we developed a novel computational
model of HSC activation through IL-1ȕ, IL-6, and TGF-ȕ signaling with feedback from miR-21 and
miR-146a. We utilized this model to identify the network balances and timing constraints that may
be critical to altering the dynamic switch between miR-21 and miR-146a during HSC activation.
Activation of HSCs is an inherently dynamic multi-scale process due to cell–cell interactions and
the tissue microenvironment regulating paracrine signaling and activating intracellular pathways. For
the present purpose, we approximated the multi-scale nature of the regulation by considering
microRNA based molecular markers as indicators of the HSC cellular state at physiological scales.
This approximation constrains our model formulation to focus on key pathway components
regulating the switch between microRNAs. By creating an integrated model based on observed
molecular and phenotypic states, we are able to study how changes at the molecular level likely
translate to changes at the cellular level.
2. Methods
The integrated signaling pathways and microRNA regulation model were developed as a Petri net
system [31]. Petri nets are weighted directed graphs that make use of graph theoretical methods,
which can efficiently simulate biological signal transduction, metabolic and gene networks. In Petri
nets, molecular components are represented as place nodes and biochemical reactions are considered
transition nodes. To better represent the complexity of our biological system, we modeled the
network as a stochastic Petri net, where stochasticity was introduced as an exponentially distributed
firing rate for each of the components (i.e., the likelihood of the waiting times of the nodes to activate
had an exponential distribution). The Petri net model was implemented using the software Snoopy
(version 1.13, Brandenburg University of Technology, Cottbus, Germany, 2014), which provided a
graphical platform for model construction, computational modeling and simulation of the network [32].

4
Transition nodes were modeled to operate by either mass action or Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The
kinetic parameters were manually tuned through an iterative process. Initial value ranges were
selected from several sources—TGF-ȕ-receptor binding values were estimated from [33], activation
of STAT3 and inhibition by SOCS3 from [34], and downstream SMAD/SMURF signaling in the
TGF-ȕ pathway from [35]. A total of 250 Monte Carlo simulations were run using the Gillespie
algorithm for each analysis scenario. In the case of transient signaling, cytokine inputs were modeled
as pulse functions using pre-scheduled transitions. For persistent signaling, the initial step input
signals were held throughout the simulation.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. microRNAs as Markers of Hepatic Stellate Cell Molecular Phenotypes
Activated stellate cells play a major role in the development of liver fibrosis by contributing to
the pro-fibrogenic pathways and other signaling pathways leading to ECM production. It has been
shown that autoregulatory feedback loops between these pathways and microRNAs influence the
fate of the activated stellate cells. Altered microRNA expression levels have been previously reported
in activated HSCs [22,23]. In particular, miR-21 has been shown to be upregulated in both activated
HSCs and regenerating livers, and is known to be over expressed in certain cancer types [22,36]. In
contrast, miR-146a was shown to be significantly down regulated during HSC activation (~17-fold
decrease in expression levels) [22]. We analyzed the intensity values obtained from the microarray
data for quiescent and activated hepatic stellate cells to generate relative microRNA levels [22]. The
expression level of these microRNAs varied in opposite fashion during HSC activation (Figure 1).
Based on these findings, we postulated that anti-correlation between these two microRNAs and their
relative expression levels may be playing a role in regulating the central signaling pathways in
activated HSCs and may be used as representative markers of the HSC activation state. Our approach
is the first step towards addressing the testable hypothesis that the microRNA behavior based kinetics
may contribute to the cellular phenotypic changes leading to HSC activation.

hepatic stellate cells. Data are derived from published microarray data on microRNA
expression in primary hepatic stellate cells collected from Wistar rats (Gene Expression
Omnibus accession GSE19462) [22].

3.2. Integrated Model of Signaling and microRNA Regulation
An overview of the modeled signaling pathways and components is shown in Figure 2. Activation
or inhibition arrows ending on species nodes represent influences on production or degradation,
respectively. The arrows ending on other arrows represent modification of the corresponding
reaction/interaction. For example, PEL1/TRAF6 levels positively influence the transformation of
NF-țB inactive into NF-țB active form. NF-țBactive species lead to higher production of miR-146a and
miR-21. Similarly, miR-146a levels negatively influence the activation of PEL1/TRAF6 complex,
and also reduce levels of SMAD4. In order to explore the dynamics of these microRNAs leading to
an activated HSC phenotype, we developed a stochastic Petri net model incorporating several
well-characterized pathways that have been shown to play a role in the activation of HSCs and
stimulation of liver fibrogenesis.
A Petri net implementation of the integrated network is shown in Figure 3. Our model includes
IL-1/NF-țB, IL-6/STAT3, and TGF-ȕ/SMAD signaling pathways interacting with miR-146a and
miR-21. We explored the contributions of individual pathways to the differential regulation of
microRNAs to identify necessary and sufficient regulatory relationships to account for the microRNA
switch during HSC activation. We started with the IL-1/NF-țB pathway alone and continued to
sequentially expand our model to include IL-6/STAT3 and TGF-ȕ/SMAD pathways.

3.2.1. Model of the IL-1/NF-țB Pathway
Constitutive activity of the transcription factor nuclear factor-țB (NF-țB) has been strongly
implicated in the promotion of liver fibrogenesis and HSC activation [37,38]. In our model, the
proinflammatory cytokine IL-1 activates the NF-țB pathway (Figure A1). The production of IL-1
and IL-1R leads to the formation of an IL-1/IL-1R complex in a concentration-dependent manner.
This complex can either dissociate into its individual components or proceed to the activation of the
next component in the pathway via signal transduction [39]. During persistent signal transduction
IL-1/IL-1R activates the PELI1/TRAF6 (Pellino 1/tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated
factor 6) complex. NF-țB is represented in the model as distributed across two likely states: an
inactive species that is activated by PELI1/TRAF6 complex, and an active species that is capable of
upregulating its target genes. The balance between the production and degradation maintains the
steady state levels of the inactive species. In the presence of active PELI1/TRAF6 complex, the
transition from inactive to active form of NF-țB is modeled using mass action kinetics. The
activation of NF-țB is modeled as a reversible reaction approximately accounting for shuttling
between cytoplasm and nucleus that is not explicitly represented in the model. In biological systems,
the PELI1/TRAF6 complex is the result of interactions between several other proteins, such as IL-1
receptor-associated kinases (IRAK1/IRAK4), and causes activation of NF-țB by mediating its
release from inhibitory protein IțB [39]. Our model approximates these intermediary reactions as a

7
single reaction with apparent kinetic parameter values yielding an NF-țB activation profile similar
to experimental observations.
Once activated, NF-țB increases expression of miR-21 and miR-146a [29,30]. In the model,
microRNA production by activated NF-țB is governed by mass action kinetics. Previous
experimental studies have shown that miR-21 targets Peli1, thereby creating a potential negative
feedback targeting NF-țB signaling [29]. miR-146a has been shown to modulate the IL-1 signaling
pathway by targeting IRAK1 and TRAF6 to induce their down regulation [29,30]. Based on these
observations, miR-21 and miR-146a was modeled as inhibiting the PELI1/TRAF6 complex. This
results in a negative feedback loop between the microRNAs and NF-țB activation.
We tested whether activation of NF-țB pathway is sufficient to lead to the experimentally
observed switch between miR-21 and miR-146a levels. Simulations showed that both miR-21 and
miR-146a levels closely followed the profile of active NF-țB (Figure 4A). Both microRNAs
exhibited an initial increase in their levels, followed by a drop-off to steady state levels higher than
baseline. Despite the presence of inhibitory feedback, there was no phenotypic switch from a
miR-21low miR-146ahigh state to a miR-21high miR-146alow state. Based on the network structure in
which NF-țB serves as an activator of both microRNAs, the switch from a miR-21low miR-146ahigh
state to a miR-21high miR-146alow state can occur only with differential rates of activation of the two
microRNAs. The model was expanded to include additional signaling pathways in order to
accomplish such differential microRNA regulation.
It is known that NF-țB acts primarily as a mediator of immune and inflammatory responses in
liver cells [37]. However, NF-țB in has been shown to function as an anti-apoptotic factor and
promote the expression of numerous growth factors and cytokines, including IL-6, in HSCs [2,40].
IL-6 plays a key role in activating the transcription factor STAT3, which has recently been found to
be a necessary factor in liver fibrosis [10,40]. In addition, STAT3 has been shown to induce miR-21
expression in a cancer context to inhibit tumor suppressor pathways [41]. We tested whether the
addition of the IL-6/STAT3 pathway to our model was sufficient to yield a microRNA switch.
3.2.2. Model of the IL-6/STAT3 Pathway
STAT3 activation in liver non-parenchymal cells, such as HSCs, occurs in response to IL-6
signaling, among other cytokines [42]. IL-6 binds to its receptor, IL-6R, to form the IL-6/IL-6R complex
(Figure A2). Binding of ligand-receptor complex IL-6/IL-6R and its dissociation are modeled using
mass action kinetics. The IL-6/IL-6R complex leads to activation of STAT3. Our model
approximates an intermediate step whereby IL-6/IL-6R activates the protein Janus kinase (JAK),
causing STAT3 phosphorylation [42]. Once activated, phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) is able to
upregulate the expression of its target genes. Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), activated
by pSTAT3, targets the signaling intermediary gp130 protein to inhibit STAT3 activation [42]. The
kinetics of this negative feedback were modeled using Michaelis-Menten formalism with SOCS3
acting as a competitive inhibitor that reduces STAT3 activation. STAT3 activation in HSCs increases
miR-21 expression significantly [43]. Our model approximates the upregulation of miR-21 by pSTAT3
using mass action kinetics.

(B) Expression levels considering IL-1/NF-țB and IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathways
regulating the microRNAs. Solid arrowheads mark the start of input cytokine stimuli.

Simultaneous activation of NF-țB and STAT3 pathways led to higher levels of miR-21 and a
modest increase in steady state miR-146a levels (Figure 4B). However, miR-146a levels remained
high, contrary to experimental observations [8], indicating that the activation of these pathways is
insufficient to induce the microRNA switch. These results indicated the requirement for negative
regulation of one or both of the microRNAs to account for the switch during HSC activation.
Previous experimental studies have shown that STAT3 promotes production of TGF-ȕ, a key
factor in driving HSC-mediated fibrogenesis [10]. Based on these results, the STAT3 pathway was
modified as leading to production of TGF-ȕ. Additionally, crosstalk between TGF-ȕ pathway and
microRNAs in liver has been well studied [44,45]. Based on these findings we expanded the model
to include a TGF-ȕ-mediated pathway leading to activation of genes driving fibrogenesis and likely
regulate miR-21 and miR-146a expression.
3.2.3. Model of the TGF-ȕ/SMAD Pathway
Active TGF-ȕ binds to TGF-ȕ receptor I (TȕRI), forming TGF-ȕ:TȕRI complex (Figure A3). The
ligand receptor complex is then able to dissociate, or promote the activation of SMAD2. This
activation step accounts for the ligand-receptor complex-mediated phosphorylation of SMAD2 [33,46].
Inactive SMAD2 is present at a steady state level balanced by its constitutive production and
degradation. The active, phosphorylated SMAD2 species (pSMAD2) is able to bind to another

9
protein, SMAD4, with a 2:1 stoichiometry of SMAD2 vs. SMAD4. This complex, termed
pSMAD2/SMAD4 in the model, leads to increase in expression of SMURF2 and SMAD7, which act
as negative regulators of TGF-ȕ signaling. The translocation of pSMAD2/SMAD4 into the nucleus
has been approximated in the activation rates specified in the model. SMAD7 exerts its influence by
blocking SMAD2 phosphorylation and is also able to form a complex with SMURF2 to promote
degradation of TȕRI [47,48]. miR-146a is involved in the inhibition of TGF-ȕ-induced HSC
proliferation and activation by decreasing SMAD4 protein expression [45]. miR-21 is known to
directly target and inhibit SMAD7, thereby creating as a positive feedback to the pro-fibrogenic
TGF-ȕ pathway [44,45].
Simulations of the expanded model did not impact the dynamic profiles of microRNAs due to the
lack of regulation by the TGF-ȕ pathway. This led us to hypothesize that the shift in balance of the
microRNAs is driven by the pro-fibrotic target genes of the TGF-ȕ pathway. Previous studies
identified the activation of fibrotic genes by the TGF-ȕ pathway [10]. Experimental studies in tissues
other than liver have demonstrated an opposing influence of the TGF-ȕ pathway on miR-21 and
miR-146a expression [45,49]. However, downstream effectors of the TGF-ȕ/SMAD pathway on
these microRNAs in HSCs are presently unknown. Based on this phenomenological relationship, we
introduced an empirical pro-fibrotic gene (FG) as a downstream target of the TGF-ȕ/SMAD pathway.
In our model, activation of FG modulates microRNA expression by upregulating miR-21 and
downregulating miR-146a via mass action kinetics.
3.3. Crosstalk between Signaling Pathways and Effect on microRNA Levels
Simulations of the integrated network with crosstalk between STAT3 and TGF-ȕ pathway as well
as the microRNAs were able to reproduce the expected phenotypic switch of microRNA levels
(Figure 5). Our results were consistent with the experimentally observed dynamics of microRNA
levels. miR-21 levels showed robust increase upon cytokine stimuli. Following the peak expression,
miR-21 levels approached a steady state and were maintained well above baseline expression.
However, the initial upregulation of miR-146a due to NF-țB activation was followed by a decline
due to the negative regulation mediated by increase in FG levels. Over the course of the simulation,
miR-146a expression increased steadily to below baseline levels, closely mimicking the in vitro
experimental data on HSC activation [22]. These results emphasized the role of crosstalk between
the TGF-ȕ pathway and microRNAs to lead to a pro-fibrogenic activated HSC phenotype.
Our results highlight the relative dynamic contribution of exogenous signaling molecules such as
cytokines IL-1 and IL-6 produced by other liver cells, as well as endogenous molecules such as
TGF-ȕ produced by HSCs, to the microRNA switch underlying HSC activation.

integrated model with all three signaling pathways.

3.4. Effects of Timing Differences in NF-țB and STAT3 Activation
We examined the effect of differential timing in activation of NF-țB and STAT3 pathways on the
dynamic regulation of microRNAs. Previous experimental results indicated that NF-țB activation
occurs earlier, with activity spiking rapidly before decreasing to a lower steady state, whereas peak
STAT3 activation occurs later followed by a steady decline [50]. However, we considered an
alternative scenario in which peak NF-țB activation occurred after that of STAT3, which is likely to
happen in the case of altered cell–cell signaling interactions, to evaluate the effects on downstream
microRNA expression. Our simulation results revealed that earlier NF-țB peak activity than that of
STAT3 resulted in an initial transient increase of both miR-146a and miR-21 expression along with
a delayed microRNA switch (Figure 6A). Upon STAT3 activation, miR-21 expression levels further
increased and miR-146a levels decreased before both reached a steady state. The alternative case of
later NF-țB peak activity led to an initial monotonic decrease in miR-146a levels to levels below the
baseline expression, and a persistent increase in miR-21 levels (Figure 6B). Both microRNAs showed
a slight increase in expression levels upon NF-țB activation, eventually reaching the same steady
state levels as the first scenario. These results suggest that the timing of cytokine stimuli is
responsible for controlling the initial dynamics of microRNA expression, but does not significantly
alter the overall expression profile or steady state levels. Experimental validation of initial
microRNA dynamics could provide insight into the physiological relevance of differential
cytokine signaling.

cytokine stimuli. (A) Expression levels with synchronized cytokine production;
(B) Expression levels with staggered cytokine production (IL-6 produced before IL-1).

3.5. Re-Quiescence from the Activated HSC State
Finally, we explored the dynamics of microRNAs as the system returned from an activated to a
quiescent phenotype. The simulation was allowed to reach an activated state phenotype followed by
the termination of cytokine stimuli. During re-quiescence, both miR-146a and miR-21 levels
decreased initially due to the rapid decline of NF-țB and STAT3 activity (Figure 7). Unlike miR-21,
which steadily decreased to baseline levels as STAT3 and FG activity declines, miR-146a recovered
from the drop in expression and eventually returned to baseline levels. Although the miR-146a
expression level patterns were similar to those previously observed in vitro by Maubach et al., the
return of miR-146a to baseline levels is insufficient to completely restore a quiescent HSC
phenotype [22]. This indicates the involvement of additional factors participating in the complex
biological process of re-quiescence. Therefore, accounting for additional microRNAs and other
pathways regulating the gene expression might be necessary to capture the multi-scale regulation of
HSC phenotypes leading to re-quiescence.

4. Conclusions
Activation of HSCs, which relies on a variety of interconnected signaling pathways, plays a
critical role in the development of liver fibrosis. There is increasing evidence for the role of
microRNAs in regulating the transformation of quiescent into activated HSCs [23]. Although many
of the fibrogenic pathways have been previously studied, further investigation is required to better
understand the role of crosstalk between pathways and their regulation mediated by the microRNAs.
To address this gap in knowledge, we developed a Petri net system-based model to study regulatory
interactions between the microRNAs miR-21 and miR-146a that may occur through as yet unknown
direct or indirect mechanisms [22,36].
We performed model simulations to test whether known interactions between signaling and
microRNAs can explain the differential regulation of miR-21 and miR-146a. Our results indicate that
NF-țB and STAT3 signaling pathways are not sufficient to account for the anti-parallel regulation
of these microRNAs. Activation of the TGF-ȕ/SMAD pathway by STAT3 also appears to be
insufficient to mimic the measured phenotype. Therefore, we introduced a phenomenological
relationship between downstream fibrotic genes (FG) and microRNAs into our model as an
additional component that upregulated miR-21 expression and downregulated miR-146a expression.
The introduction of TGF-ȕ/SMAD pathway-mediated differential microRNA regulation was
necessary to induce a switch between microRNA levels. Upon termination of the cytokine stimuli,
the system returned to its quiescent state. This ability of HSCs to switch between activated and
quiescent states is critical for maintaining proper liver function, and dysregulation of this process can
play a role in the development of liver fibrosis.

13
Timing of the activation of cytokines plays a significant role in the activation of inflammatory
markers during liver regeneration. It is known that timing of cytokine signaling in HSCs is dependent
on the type of damage. NF-țB and STAT3 pathways are likely to be activated simultaneously in the
case of damage due to infection or alcohol intake. In contrast, in the case of drug-induced liver injury
and liver regeneration, IL-1 stimulus is known to precede the IL-6-dependent activation of STAT3
pathway [51]. Cytokine signaling in HSCs is the result of paracrine factors from other cells, and the
timing of cell communication can determine HSC response to injury. In order to determine how
differential activation of cytokine stimuli influences the dynamics of microRNA expression, we
analyzed two possible scenarios. These are primarily applicable to the whole liver tissue, however
testing these possibilities for HSCs using our model can lead to predictions reconciling the potential
difference in temporal relationships between the activation of NF-țB and STAT3 pathways in in vivo
vs. in vitro conditions. Our results show that the relative timing between cytokine stimuli in HSCs
alters the initial dynamics of microRNA expression. Earlier activation of NF-țB resulted in an initial
transient increase in expression of both microRNAs, whereas later activation of NF-țB versus
STAT3 resulted in an initial monotonic decrease in miR-146a while miR-21 gradually increased and
reach steady state levels.
There is a paucity of evidence in the literature regarding the kinetics of HSC activation. We have
used empirical kinetic approximations in order to bridge this gap in knowledge. For parameters, we
relied on a range of values obtained from previous modeling studies. However, most of our kinetic
parameters were derived through an iterative process. This approach provided us with responses that
qualitatively matched the expected kinetics. However, a formal global sensitivity analysis will enable
us to fine-tune the model parameters to develop more accurate HSC specific predictions [52]. We
believe that such a model based on the HSC specific biology can lead to testable hypothesis on HSC
activation that can be validated by experiments. For example, the use of exogenous cytokines for
in vitro studies has been previously reported for HSCs, and could be easily adapted to investigate the
possible role of cell–cell communication in microRNA expression dynamics using HSC cultures [53].
Briefly, the cells would be pre-treated with IL-1 or IL-6, followed by addition of the alternate
cytokine at a later time point, and microRNA levels would be quantified over this time series.
Upregulation of microRNAs can be accomplished by addition of a precursor for the microRNA of
interest, and could help determine, for example, the effect of miR-146a overexpression on
re-quiescence [43]. In addition to overexpression, knockout studies can be utilized both in vitro and
in vivo to investigate the role of key components in HSC activation. For example, transfection of
cultured HSCs with anti-miR sequences or siRNA against a gene can be used to investigate the
relative importance of specific microRNAs and genes in HSC activation, as well as the consequences
of their removal. This could be used to determine whether or not, for instance, TGF-ȕ or miR-21 is
necessary for HSC activation. These studies can be expanded to include transgenic knockout models,
in the case of gene targets, or with the introduction of anti-miR pharmacological compounds, e.g.,
Vivo-Morpholino [43]. In order to study the effects of these changes in activated HSCs, it is
important to ensure that the cells achieve total differentiation from the quiescent state. To this end, it
has been reported that HSCs require a stiff culture environment in order to undergo activation [54].

14
However, it is not entirely clear how the biomechanical aspects specifically regulate signaling
pathways and microRNAs considered in the present model.
Our model accounts for a representative marker of HSC activation representing the switch in
miR-21 and miR-146a levels, and can be expanded to consider additional mechanisms of microRNA
regulation of target genes, e.g., transcriptional degradation versus translational repression. Further
avenues for model expansion include incorporation of co-regulated microRNAs as well as signaling
and metabolic pathways involved in HSC activation and re-quiescence [2,22]. Our model provides a
new computational platform for studying HSC activation and the mechanisms where microRNAs
act as fine-tuning markers modulating the system behavior, thereby contributing to potential
therapeutic approaches.

Mathematical Modeling and Analysis of Crosstalk
between MAPK Pathway and Smad-Dependent TGF-ȕ
Signal Transduction
Ji Liu, Wei Dai and Juergen Hahn
Abstract: Broad evidence exists for cross talk between the Mitogen-activated protein kinases
(MAPK) pathway and Smad-dependent TGF-ȕ signal transduction. A variety of studies, oftentimes
involving different cell types, have identified several potential mechanisms for the crosstalk.
However, there is no clear consensus on the actual mechanism(s) responsible for the crosstalk. This
work develops a model of the pathway, including several hypothesized crosstalk mechanisms, and
discusses which of the potential mechanisms can appropriately describe observed behaviors.
Simulation results show a good agreement of the findings with results reported in the literature.

1. Introduction
The Transforming Growth Factor ȕ (TGF-ȕ) family of proteins is involved in regulating a
variety of cellular processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, immune functions
and tumor invasion/metastasis [1–5]. TGF-ȕ signals through a receptor complex of serine/threonine
kinase type I (TbRI) and type II (TbRII) receptors. Upon ligand-binding, this receptor complex
activation leads to phosphorylation of cytoplasmic mediated Smad2 and/or Smad3 (R-Smad). This
phosphorylation at the C-terminal SSXS motif of Smad2/3 allows them to form a heteromeric
complex with the common mediator Smad (C-Smad), Smad4. These complexes translocate into the
nucleus and act as transcription factors to regulate target gene expression [1]. The nuclear Smad
complexes are then dephosphorylated by Smad phosphatases [6]. It should be noted that while
TGF-ȕ activates Smad signaling, Smad plays an important role in the epithelial to mesenchymal
transition, which is important for tumor metastasis [7].
While the Smad pathway is considered one of the main pathways for TGF-ȕ signaling,
it nevertheless has to be considered in a broader context as other pathways directly influence Smad
signaling activity [8,9]. The fact that some of this crosstalk is also activated by TGF-ȕ makes the
problem of investigating Smad signaling even more challenging [10].
Mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), including Erk1/2, JNK1/2/3, and p38/MAPKs, is a
family of kinases. Multiple extracellular stimuli, such as cytokines, Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF),
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), as well as TGF-ȕ, can initiate a cascade of serial phosphorylation
activation from MAP kinase kinase kinases (MAPKKKs) to MAP kinase kinases (MAPKKs) and
finally to MAPKs [8]. Broad evidence exists for crosstalk of Smad signaling with the MAPK
pathway, which has a significant effect on TGF-ȕ induced signal transduction. The crosstalk is
highly cell-type dependent and either inhibits or enhances the TGF-ȕ/Smad pathway [8].

24
Erk activation by TGF-ȕ has been observed in mesenchymal cells. Linker region
phosphorylation of Smad2 and 3 by activated Erk resulted in increased half-life of C-terminal
phosphorylated Smad2 and 3 and increased duration of Smad target gene transcription [1]. MAPKs
play an important role in TGF-ȕ mediated extracellular matrix production in mesangial cells [9].
Hayashida et al. [11] showed that blocking Erk inhibited TGF-ȕ stimulation of Smad2 C-terminal
phosphorylation and Smad2 association with Smad4 in human mesangial cells. The interaction is
through Erk-induced phosphorylation of Smad2 in the linker region. Funaba et al. [12] reported that
constitutively active MEK induced by EGF increased the half-life of Smad2 and enhanced the
Smad2-dependent transcription activity in mink lung epithelial cells and COS7 cells. It has been
shown that TGF-ȕ induced receptor activation stimulated a parallel p42/p44 MAPK pathway that
targeted Smad2 for an increased nuclear translocation and enhanced gene activation [13]. A high
level of phosphorylated Smad2 in the linker region (PSmadL) was detected in a fraction of TGF-ȕ
treated vascular smooth-muscle cells [13]. In addition, the inhibitors of Erk and p38 attenuated the
effect of TGF-ȕ on increasing PSmadL.
Conversely, extensive observations have been reported that Erk negatively regulates the TGF-ȕ
induced gene transcription in some hyperactive Ras signaling cells [14–17]. Kretzschmar et al. [14,15]
suggested that oncogenic Ras signaling can directly interfere with Smad-dependent responses by
attenuating the agonist-induced nuclear accumulation of Smad1, Smad2, and Smad3 in mammary
and lung epithelial cells. This effect is mediated by the phosphorylation of Smad1, Smad2, and
Smad3 in the linker region by Ras-activated Erk1 and Erk2 protein kinases. A possible explanation
for the contradictory observations is that responses, which depend on a certain level of nuclear
Smad activity, may require the counterbalancing effect of Ras signaling to achieve a suitable level
of nuclear Smad activity [18]. In a majority of human cancers carrying oncogenic Ras mutations,
the activity rather than the levels of Ras expression is elevated. Thus, the levels of Ras activity are
affected by the levels of MAPK activity, ultimately shaping the TGF-ȕ response via crosstalk
between Smad and the Ras-MAPK pathway [19].
Although crosstalk between the MAPK pathway and TGF-ȕ/Smad signal transduction has been
widely described, most of the studies only investigated this relationship for one specific cell type.
As it is possible, and even quite likely, that different mechanisms are dominant in different cell
types, this paper seeks to model and analyze the different proposed mechanisms. A model of the
pathways, including different potential crosstalk mechanisms, is developed and thoroughly
analyzed with respect to the effect that these mechanisms have on the observed response. Specific
emphasis has been put on uncertainty in the model, as modeling potential mechanisms implies that
the model structure is not well known. The goal of the presented work is to contribute to the
understanding of crosstalk between the MAPK pathway and TGF-ȕ/Smad signaling.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Model of the TGF-ȕ/Smad Pathway
The part of the model representing the TGF-ȕ/Smad pathway used in this work was developed
by Zi et al. [6]. This model takes into account the receptor trafficking and endocytosis, Smads

25
nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, Smad complex formation and dissociation, and the ligand induced
negative feedback. There are 16 states and 20 parameters in the model. The nominal values of the
model parameters were derived from experimental analysis in epithelial cells. The equations and
the nominal parameter values for this model can be obtained from the literature [6]. Simulation
results which agree well with experimental data include: The level of nuclear Smad complex, i.e.,
the transcription factor, peaked at approximately 45 min after TGF-ȕ addition and then declined to
saturate above the basal level after about 5–6 h; the type I receptor kinase inhibitor SB431542
added at 30 min will cause rapid decrease of the nuclear Smad complex level to the basal level;
also, TGF-ȕ caused a change in the overall Smad2 distribution from predominantly in the
cytoplasm to predominantly in the nucleus, which suggests TGF-ȕ induces a change in the
intercellular location of the majority of Smad2.
Similar to the simulation by Zi et al. two different types of stimulations are implemented in this
work. The first stimulation is exposure to a constant level of 2 ng/mL of TGF-ȕ. The second
stimulation adds 2 ng/mL of TGF-ȕ for 60 min after which the signal is terminated, which can
experimentally be achieved via the addition of the type I receptor kinase inhibitor SB431542.
2.2. Model of the MAPK Pathway
The stimulus-response behavior of the MAPK pathway exhibits ultra-sensitivity and a Sigmoidlike shape [20–22]. When the ligand concentration is above a specific value, the variation of the
output signal is negligible. Because most of experiments on the crosstalk between the two
pathways focused on the low-stimulus response, this work will focus on low stimulus levels where
the stimulus-response curves are less steep than those at high stimulation.
Multiple extracellular stimuli (cytokines, EGF, HGF), as well as TGF-ȕ itself, can initiate a
cascade of serial phosphorylation activation from MKKKs to MKKs and finally MAPKs. MAPKs
such as Erk, JNK or p38 are the kinases of the cascade. The kinases of the first level, MKKKs, are
activated by several mechanisms involving Ras (in the case of Erk) activation or other MAP kinase
kinase kinase kinases (MKKKKs) activation [22]. Schoeberl et al. established a detailed model of the
EGF-stimulated MAPK pathway, which consists of 94 states and 95 parameters using mass action
kinetics [23]. However, this model is quite complex and includes a significant amount of detail,
which is not necessary for this study, and can possibly even be detrimental due to uncertainties in
the interactions of the pathways. In contrast to this, Kholodenko’s model [22], consisting of 8 states
and 22 parameters, is used in this work for the three-level cascade from Ras/MKKKKs to MAPKs.
The input stimulus of this MAPK cascade is the concentration of activated receptors
(Ras/MKKKKs). However, the receptor activation mechanism in response to extracellular stimuli
is not well understood for the pathway investigated in this work. In order to address this point, the
input stimulus of the MAPK cascade, namely the concentration of activated receptors, can be
written as
V1 = V0 exp (íȖ (t í t0))

(1)

where, 1/Ȗ is the characteristic time of activated receptors (Ras/MKKKKs). The smaller the value
of Ȗ, the longer the receptor will be in the activated state. In the limiting case of Ȗĺ0, the pathway

26
is permanently activated [20]. Here, t0 is introduced to represent the delayed response to
extracellular stimuli and V0 is the concentration of activated receptors at t = 0.
Evidence has indicated that the time, level and duration of MAPKs activation are not correlated
with a specific cellular function, but it appears to be regulated in a cell-type and stimulus-specific
manner [24]. For example, EGF results in a transient activation of MAPK pathway in PC12
pheochromocytoma cells, whereas the nerve growth factor (NGF) is associated with a sustained
activation of the MAPK pathway in PC12 cells. Although the exact mechanisms of Erk, JNK, or
p38 MAPK activation by TGF-ȕ are poorly understood, it has been observed that TGF-ȕ-induced
MAPKs activation also varies with cell type. In some cell lines, delayed activation suggests an
indirect response requiring protein translation, whereas in others, activation is rapid and
comparable to signaling by EGF [25]. Rapid and transient p38 MAPK activation by TGF-ȕ has
been described in certain cell types, including human neutrophils, HEK293, and C2C12 cells,
whereas the prolonged and sustained p38 MAPK activation was observed in pancreatic carcinoma
cells, hepatocytes and osteoblasts [26]. Hough et al. reported that Erk phosphorylation in
mesenchymal cells became significant between 60 and 90 min and increased for at least 3 h after
TGF-ȕ addition [1]. In mesenchymal AKR-2B cells, Erk phosphorylation became detectable
between 20 and 40 min of TGF-ȕ treatment and remained elevated for at least 120 min [23].
Blanchette et al. [27] observed that TGF-ȕ stimulation of HepG2 cells resulted in a relatively
delayed (detectable at the 30 min time point), but sustained, p42/p44 MAPK phosphorylation with
a maximum at the 2 h time point.
It is clear that the parameters Ȗ, t0 and V0 are dependent on the cell types and extracellular
stimuli used. V0 is dependent on the concentration of the extracellular stimulus. The protein
dynamics in the MAPK pathway has a similar nature over the entire range of values for V0. As
such, V0 is set to be proportional to the initial concentration of extracellular stimuli. In this case the
combination of Equation (1) and the three-level cascade model presented by Kholodenho [22]
shows good agreement with the model described by Schoeberl et al. [23]. The stimulus-response
behaviors of the two models for proteins of interest to this work have been found to be similar in
simulations (data not shown).
Therefore, the combination of Equation (1) and the three-level cascade model presented by
Kholodenko [22] is used to describe the MAPK pathway in this work. The nominal values of other
parameters of this model can be found in the literature [22].
2.3. Interaction Mechanisms Reported in the Literature
As mentioned above, there is significant evidence of interactions between the MAPK and the
TGF-ȕ/Smad pathway. A summary of interaction mechanisms reported in the literature is
provided below.
A number of studies mention that the linker region phosphorylation of Smad proteins plays
an important role on how MAPKs, i.e., Erk, p38, or JNK, affect the TGF-ȕ/Smad pathway [1,2,9–15].
Reported mechanisms include activated MAPKs phosphorylating R-Smad proteins, regulating
nuclear translocation or DNA binding of Smads [9], all of which either enhance or inhibit the
TGF-ȕ induced gene expression. Although the exact mechanisms whereby MAPKs regulate Smads

27
nuclear translocation and DNA binding are still unknown, it is clear that multiple interactions
between MAPK and Smad pathways might occur depending on the cell types and possibly the extent
of MAPK activation. The reported mechanisms from the literature fall into the following categories:
I.
II.
III.

IV.

Activated Erk, p38 or JNK, phosphorylates R-Smad in linker region. This process attenuates
the R-Smad concentration and inhibits R-Smad association with C-Smad in the cytoplasm [2,25].
Activated Erk, p38 or JNK regulates the translocation of the Smad complex from the
cytoplasm to the nucleus [10].
Activated Erk, p38 or JNK phosphorylates R-Smad in the linker region. This phosphorylated
Smad (PSmadL) translocates into the nucleus and then inhibits the dephosphorylation, which
is linked to the dissociation of the nuclear Smad complex [12].
The nuclear transcription factors of the MAPK pathway, c-Fos and c-Jun, bind to the nuclear
Smad complex to regulate its transcription activity [9].

The first three interaction mechanisms explain the regulation of Smads nuclear translocation via
proteins involved in the MAPK pathway, and the last one describes the regulation of DNA binding
of Smads. Interaction IV, the Smad complex association with other transcription factors, was
thought to be a possible crosstalk point by many researchers [2,8–11]. While c-Jun interacts with
the Smad transcriptional co-repressor TG-interacting factor (TGIF) to suppress Smad transcriptional
activity [28], inhibition of TGIF by Ras is not sufficient to significantly affect the response to TGF-ȕ
stimulation [29]. This implies that interactions other than interaction IV must also contribute to the
inhibition. Because Smads translocate into the nucleus in response to TGF-ȕ, the interactions
between Smads and MAPKs may be regulated largely by the alteration of Smad intercellular
localization [30]. Due to this, the focus of this work is on the regulation of Smads nuclear
translocation by MAPKs, which is given by the first three interaction mechanisms listed above.
A simplified model of the crosstalk including the four potential interactions is depicted in Figure 1,
followed by a survey table (Table 1) of literature studies of the possible interaction mechanisms.
The column “assumed mechanisms” in Table 1 refers to the first three interactions affecting Smads
nuclear translocation. Some of literature [4–6,9,23,27] mentioned evident changes in Smads
nuclear translocation due to MAPKs activation, but no detailed kinetic mechanism is provided. This is
represented by “*” in Table 1.
2.4. Global Sensitivity Analysis
Parameter sensitivity analysis provides a powerful tool to analyze mathematical models of
biological signaling networks. The analysis can improve the understanding of the signaling networks
by identifying the contribution of individual factors to the signaling response. Furthermore it can be
used to recognize the identifiability of key parameters through their sensitivity vectors, which is
essential for estimation of these parameters [32,33].
Local sensitivity analysis addresses model behavior near a particular point in the parameter
space—a nominal point, whereas global sensitivity analysis does so over a wide range of parameter
values. The Morris method is an example of a global sensitivity analysis method [34] which is
more suitable for analysis signal transduction pathway models than a local method. The method

28
consists of a repetition of local evaluations whereby the output derivative di (t) is calculated for
each parameter pi by adding a small change ¨i to the parameter:

di ( t ) =

y ( t , p1 , p2 , ⋅⋅⋅, pi + Δi , ⋅⋅⋅, pk ) − y ( t , p1 , p2 , ⋅⋅⋅, pi , ⋅⋅⋅, pk )
Δi

, i = 1, ⋅⋅⋅, k

(2)

where, di (t) is called the elementary effect of the i-th parameter at time t, p1, p2, …, pk are the
model parameters analyzed, and y is a model output.

The Morris method computes the average of the elementary effects over a number of points in
parameter space and will therefore reflect an average of the sensitivity over a region of the
parameter space. The mean of the elementary effects is defined as the sensitivity measure
1 h
Si = ¦ d ij ( t )
(3)
h j =1
where, Si is the sensitivity measure of output y with respect to the i-th parameter. dij (t) is the
elementary effect of the i-th parameter at the j-th sampling point, h is the number of sampling
points. The sensitivity is a function of time and sensitivities at different time points are usually
concatenated into a sensitivity vector. The sensitivity can be normalized to ensure that the use of
different units does not affect the sensitivity analysis results.
2.5. Measures for Evaluating Output Signals
Three key characteristics are used to evaluate output signals, i.e., the transcription factor
concentrations, of the pathways. These three characteristic parameters are the signal time Ĳ, signal
duration ‫ ׇ‬and signal amplitude I, and are calculated numerically from the output signal y (t) [20].

Ĳ and ‫ ׇ‬represent the average time to activate the output element and the average time during
which this output component is activated, respectively [20]. I is defined as the ratio of total amount
of the output signal and duration ‫ ׇ‬of the signal, providing a measurement of the average
concentration of the output element [20]. These parameters are difficult to interpret if the output
signals do not return to zero, as Ĳ and ‫ ׇ‬will grow over time in this case. In order to deal with this
situation, another measure, Ĳ0.9, is defined which evaluates how fast a system responds. Ĳ0.9 is
defined as the time at which 90% of maximal output signal is reached [21]. Figure 2 shows the
geometric interpretation of the three measures used [20].

3. Model Development
As mentioned above, the individual models of the TGF-ȕ/Smad pathway and the MAPK
pathway have been described in detail in the literature [6,22]. In addition, several potential
interactions have been proposed which can be responsible for crosstalk between these two
pathways. However, the crosstalk has not been modeled in published studies. Furthermore, most of
the studies only investigated one specific type of crosstalk, usually the one dominant in a particular
cell type, and the underlying interaction kinetics was not determined. This paper seeks to address
these points by developing a model of the pathways, including different potential crosstalk
mechanisms, and thoroughly analyzing the effect that these different mechanisms have on the
observed response.

31
3.1. Potential Crosstalk Mechanisms
Three potential interaction mechanisms have been reported in the literature for the regulation of
Smads nuclear translocation via proteins involved in the MAPK pathway. As shown in Table 1,
the first interaction (point I in Figure 1) is supported by most of studies, whereas there are fewer
references mentioning the second potential interaction (point II in Figure 1). Some references
discussing the second interaction implied that MAPKs regulation of the import of cytoplasmic Smad
complex to the nucleus functions by attenuating R-Smad, which results in the same kinetics as the first
interaction. Similarly, there are fewer studies investigating the interaction at point III. A few
experimental studies [1,2] have concluded that activated MAPKs increased stability of C-terminal
phosphorylated R-Smad and the amount of the nuclear Smad complex. However, the underlying
interaction kinetics have not been disclosed.
Data suggest that the linker region phosphorylation of Smad2 (PSmadL) by the MEK1-Erk
pathway does not directly affect Smad2 affinity for Smad4 [12]. It is assumed that PSmadL
attenuates R-Smad to inhibit its association with C-Smad which causes the negative regulation of
TGF-ȕ/Smad signaling by the MAPK pathway [19]. However, this argument cannot explain the
opposite effect of the MAPK pathway on TGF-ȕ/Smad signaling reported in several sources in the
literature [1,9,11–13,27]. As previously mentioned, some studies suggest that the levels of Ras
activity could dictate the outcome of the cross talk [18,19]. Responses to TGF-ȕ may require the
counterbalancing effect of Ras signaling to achieve a suitable level of nuclear Smad activity. Based
on this, a possible kinetics for the positive regulation of TGF-ȕ/Smad signaling by MAPK pathway
is proposed in this paper: nuclear PSmadL inhibits the dephosphorylation (or dissociation) of the
nuclear Smad complex via attenuating the nuclear phosphatase, which enhances the Smad-mediated
transcription activity.
It is suggested that the increase of the nuclear Smad complex, which upregulates the gene
expression, is closely associated with nuclear PSmadL. Experiments by Hough et al. [1] and
Funaba et al. [12] showed that most of PSmadL was found in the nucleus of cell fibroblasts. These
data do not preclude the possibility of cytoplasmic phosphorylation of Smad2 in the linker region,
followed by a rapid nuclear translocation [13,35]. Burch et al. [13] also discussed that nuclear
PSmadL upregulates the gene activity in vascular smooth-muscle cells. On the other hand, it is well
known that phosphatase inhibition is the most effective way that one signaling pathway can
influence another [20]. Hough et al. [1] suggested that the negative control of the concentration of
the nuclear Smad complex is due to the dephosphorylation of the nuclear Smad complex, which
implies that the nuclear phosphatase has a strong negative control on the nuclear Smad complex
level. Thus, phosphorylation of Smad in the linker region directly or indirectly attenuates the nuclear
phosphatase and offsets its negative control on the nuclear Smad complex level. The attenuated
phosphatase decreases the dephosphorylation rate of the nuclear Smad complex and thereby affects
the its concentration of the nuclear Smad complex [12].
The above discussion supports the hypothesis that nuclear PSmadL, initiated by activated
MAPKs, inhibits the dephosphorylation of the nuclear Smad complex, which enhances the
Smad-mediated transcription activity. Therefore, the third interaction (point III) may explain the

32
positive regulation while the first one (point I) accounts for the negative regulation. Points I and III
are assumed as the possible crosstalk points of the MAPK and TGF-ȕ/Smad pathways.
3.2. Modeling Potential Crosstalk Mechanisms
It is generally acknowledged that PSmadL is a key component for integrating MAPK signals
with the TGF-ȕ/Smad pathway [1,2,9–15]. However, the exact kinetics of the Smad linker region
phosphorylation by MAPKs is poorly understood. The time course of TGF-ȕ-mediated Smad2
linker region phosphorylation, as well as Erk phosphorylation, have been reported in Western blots
in mesenchymal cells [1]. These data indicated that the time course of Smad2 linker region
phosphorylation has a similar nature as the one for Erk phosphorylation. A linear relationship is
often used to link PSmadL and MAPKs [21] from Figure 1. A similar assumption was made for the
relationship of activated receptor and proteins involved in the interaction when modeling the
crosstalk between the MAPK pathway and other pathways [20].
The potential crosstalk discussed in Section 3.1 is modeled through incorporating PSmadL into
the original model of TGF-ȕ/Smad pathway. At point I, shown in Figure 1, PSmadL can attenuate
R-Smad and consequently inhibit the R-Smad association with C-Smad in the cytoplasm, which
consequently decreases the concentration of the nuclear Smad complex. This interaction function can
be incorporated by rewriting the reaction rate describing the formation of the Smad complex:
rform =

kSmad −complex

1+ ¨
¸
KI

(7)

where, [PSmadL] represents the concentration of interaction component PSmadL and is directly
proportional to the concentration of MAPKs. KI describes the interaction strength, i.e., the smaller
the value of KI, the stronger the interaction will be. m is an adjustable parameter to control
inhibition strength, and is set to m = 1 in this work. ksmads-complex is the original reaction rate
constant, equal to 6.85 × 10í5 nM2·miní1 [6].
At point III shown in Figure 1, PSmadL may translocate into the nucleus and inhibit the
dissociation of the nuclear Smad complex, which increases the concentration of the nuclear Smad
complex. This behavior can be modeled by revising the reaction rate of the dephosphorylation of
the nuclear Smad complex:

3.3. Integrating the Individual Components of the Model
As described as Section 3.2, the interactions at point I and III account for two opposite effect of
MAPKs on the TGF-ȕ/Smad pathway. This section integrated these two competing effects into the
original models which results in a model representing the MAPK and TGF-ȕ/Smad pathways as
well as their interactions. A schematic of the model is shown in Figure 3. “R”, “MAPK cascade”
and “r” in the blue-shaded frames represent the modules of Ras/MKKKKs receptor activation by
extracellular stimuli, three-level serial phosphorylation of MAPK cascade and the linker region
phosphorylation of R-Smad by activated MAPKs, respectively. The two interactions of the MAPK
and the TGF-ȕ/Smad signaling pathways, i.e., inhibition and enhancement, are also shown. It can
be hypothesized that the two opposite effects define specific cellular responses to TGF-ȕ. A detailed
description of the equations of this model can be found in Appendix I.

3.4. Simulation Results
3.4.1. Comparisons between Crosstalk Model and Original Model
The developed model is used in simulations in this section and the results are compared with the
simulated data presented by Zi et al. [6]. A continuous TGF-ȕ stimulation (2 ng/mL) is used for the
simulations. MAPKs activation may be induced by any of the extracellular factors such as TGF-ȕ,
EGF, HGF and others as the model does not explicitly account for these extracellular factors. V0 is
set to 0.18 which suggests a low level of MAPKs activation. t0 is set to zero which indicates
MAPKs activation without time delay and Ȗ is set to 0.001 which represents a transient MAPKs
activation. The nuclear and cytoplasmic PSmad2 levels, calculated from the crosstalk model, are
compared with the simulated data from the original TGF-ȕ/Smad model [6]. Figure 4 shows the
simulated data for the crosstalk model and original model presented by Zi et al. for the case where
only inhibition occurs (KI = 1, KIIIĺ). Similarly Figure 5 shows the simulated data for the two
models for the case where only enhancement is taking place (KIĺ, KIII = 1). As described in [6],
the shape of the profiles of nuclear and cytoplasmic PSmad2 level are very similar. For the case
where only inhibition is considered, PSmanL is assumed to attenuate the Smad2 level and further
inhibit the formation of the Smad complex in the cytoplasm. It will cause a decrease of the PSmad2
level in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus, which is consistent with the simulated data shown

34
in Figure 4a,b. Conversely, for the case where only upregulation is considered, PSmadL is assumed
to inhibit the dissociation of the nuclear Smad complex. Thus, the nuclear PSmad2 level will
increase, which agrees well with the data shown in Figure 5a. This effect will cause a distinct
decrease of Smad2 level in the cytoplasm as well as the nucleus (data not shown) and consequently
leads to a slight decrease of the cytoplasmic PSmad2 level which can be seen in Figure 5b. Simulated
data from the two models are consistent with the theoretical analysis expected from the interactions.
Furthermore, simulated data of the Smad2 intercellular locations for the crosstalk model also show
that TGF-ȕ stimulation induced a change in the overall Smad2 distribution from predominantly in
the cytoplasm to being mainly in the nucleus as shown in Figure 4c and Figure 5c, which is in
agreement with the literature [6]. Simulation results using a pulse stimulation of TGF-ȕ (2 ng/mL)
for the first 30 min are also consistent with theoretical analysis and literature reports (data not shown).

the original model presented by Zi et al. [3] when only the inhibition is present for
(a) nuclear PSmad2 level; (b) cytoplasmic PSmad2 level; and (c) Smad2 intercellular
location. Note that the PSmad2 level is a relative value. Its unit is nmole when the
extracellular medium volume is set to 1 Liter [6].

intercellular location. Note that the PSmad2 level uses the same unit as described in the
caption of Figure 4.

3.4.2. Comparison with Literature Data
As shown in Table 1, many studies suggest that the crosstalk between the MAPK and the
TGF-ȕ/Smad pathways either increase or decrease the nuclear PSmad2 protein level. However, the
exact amounts of the increase or decrease are usually not mentioned as the data are often qualitative
or semi-quantitative rather than quantitative in nature. Two sets of experimental data are used for
comparison purposes here, specifically data presented by Hough et al. [1] and Blanchette et al. [27].
The decay rate of C-terminal PSmad2 in mesenchymal cells were determined experimentally by
Hough et al. [1]. The time to decrease the signal intensity by 50% differed between treatment
groups: 116 min for TGF-ȕ + U0126 vs. 135 min for TGF-ȕ alone. The intercellular location of
Smad2 was observed experimentally in the human liver cell line (HepG2) [27]. With TGF-ȕ alone
49.6% ± 3.1% of Smad2 exhibited a predominantly nuclear Smad2-specific staining compared with
10.1% ± 1.4% for unstimulated cells and 19.0% ± 0.9% for TGF-ȕ + PD98059 (PD98059 is a
MEK1-specific inhibitor). While these two sets of data cannot be used to estimate model parameters,
some qualitative comparison with the simulation data can be performed.
In the experiments by Hough et al. [1], the cell lysates were pulsed for 10 min with TGF-ȕ
(2 ng/mL) with or without U0126 (inhibitor of Erk phosphorylation). Relative signal intensity of

36
the C-terminal PSmad2 with TGF-ȕ alone and TFG-ȕ + U0126 was shown in Figure 5d of [1] by
setting the 60 min. value at 100%. The time to decrease the signal intensity by 50% was given
(116 min for TGF-ȕ + U0126 vs. 135 min for TGF-ȕ alone). Here, the decay rate of C-terminal
PSmad2 is calculated based on the crosstalk model and assumed parameter values. Due to the time
delay of Erk activation described by this experiment, t0 is set to 30 min. The concentration of
PSmadL is set to zero to mimic addition of U0126 from the experiment, and at the 10 min. time point
the concentration of TGF-ȕ is changed to zero in the simulation. For the case of [PSmadL] = 0, the
crosstalk does not occur and the scenario reduced to the one for TGF-ȕ induced Smad signaling
without crosstalk, whereas, in the case of stimulation with TGF-ȕ alone, the crosstalk is induced by
TGF-ȕ itself. Figure 6a shows the concentration profiles of C-terminal PSmad2 with crosstalk and
without crosstalk. The curves indicate that the TGF-ȕ-induced Erk activation (in case of TGF-ȕ
alone) does stabilize the PSmad2 level. The decay profiles of the signal intensity are shown in
Figure 6b, whose general trend is consistent with those shown in Figure 5d of [1]. The decay time
increased by 16% when no U0126 was added for the simulation while the increase in time was also
16% for the experimental data reported by Hough et al. [1].
Figure 6. Comparison of simulation results with and without crosstalk from the
crosstalk model for (a) nuclear PSmad2 level; and (b) relative signal intensity of
nuclear PSmad2.

Next, the intercellular location of Smad2 is calculated based on the presented crosstalk model
and compared with the experimental results presented by Blanchette et al. [27]. The experimental
data [27] indicated that phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK by TGF-ȕ was prolonged at least 30 min
and sustained for at least 2 h. Thus, t0 is set to 30 min and Ȗ = 0.0005. Zi’s experimental data
showed initially 14% of Smad2 was in the nucleus in the unstimulated mesenchymal cells. When
cells are stimulated by TGF-ȕ (10 ng/mL) and PSmadL concentration is set to zero, which mimics
the addition of PD98059 in an experiment, the ratio of nuclear Smad2 to total amount of Smad2
becomes 35% at the 1 h time point. When cells are treated by TGF-ȕ (10 ng/mL) alone, the amount
of nuclear PSmad2 increased 2.5-fold in simulations as compared to the case where stimulation
with TGF-ȕ occurred and [PSmadL] was set to zero. This value is consistent with the experimental
values observed by Blanchette et al. [27] for experiments where cells were stimulated with TGF-ȕ
and, separately, with TGF-ȕ and PD98059.

37
4. Results and Discussion
4.1. Sensitivity Analysis of Key Parameters
The presented model integrates the three-level cascade model of the MAPK pathway with the
original model of TGF-ȕ/Smad pathway and also includes two crosstalk mechanisms. The final
output, the transcription factor, will mediate the TGF-ȕ-induced gene expression.
The parameter set of this proposed model consists of three parts: the parameters of the TGF-ȕ/Smad
pathway model, the parameters of the three-level cascade model describing the MAPK pathway
and the parameters involved in the crosstalk. The nominal parameter values found in the literature
for the TGF-ȕ/Smad pathway and the MAPK cascade models have been used in this work. The
normalized sensitivity values of parameters over a period of time are calculated from the crosstalk
model by the Morris method. For the parameters of the TGF-ȕ/Smad pathway model, the
uncertainty ranges are set to 50%–150% of the nominal values. The uncertainty of the parameters
KI, KIII, V0 and Ȗ involved in the crosstalk is assumed to be much larger as no values can be found
in the literature. Their nominal values are assumed to be 5, 5, 0.18, 0.004, and their uncertainty
ranges are defined as [0.1, 10], [0.1, 10], [0.14, 0.22], [0.001, 0.01], respectively. The value ranges
of V0 and Ȗ were chosen to represent a transient, low level activation of the MAPK pathway. The
reason for choosing the specific parameters mentioned here for the sensitivity analysis is that the
interaction parameters, KI and KIII, are the key parameters to determine whether the crosstalk
inhibits or enhances the Smad transcription activity. Additionally, parameters describing receptor
activation of the MAPK pathway by extracellular factors, e.g., the parameters V0, Ȗ and t0, may
affect the crosstalk. The delay time t0 usually can be observed directly through experiments.
However, there are four unknown key parameters whose effects on the output need to be
investigated: KI, KIII, V0 and Ȗ.
Here, the time-dependent sensitivity dynamics of the transcription factor concentration with
respect to the parameters KI, KIII, V0 and Ȗ are calculated and analyzed using the Morris method. A
constant exposure of 2 ng/mL of TGF-ȕ is chosen for the analysis as well as parameters values
corresponding to a transient and low level activation of MAPKs.
The normalized sensitivity profiles with respect to the four parameters are depicted in Figure 7.
V0 has the biggest amplitude of the sensitivity but its sensitivity declines fast, whereas Ȗ has a more
significant long-term effect than V0. When KIII is perturbed, it has a considerable impact on the
amplitude and the duration of the output signal. The effect of KI is mainly observed over the initial
time interval. According to the hypothesized interaction mechanisms, MAPKs, once activated, may
quickly attenuate R-Smad to inhibit the formation of the Smad complex in cytoplasm at the initial
stage of interaction; this interaction strength is controlled by KI. On the other hand, most of
PSmadL remains in the nucleus and inhibits the dissociation of the Smad complex over a longer
time; this interaction strength is controlled by KIII. The simulation results are in good agreement
with the theoretical analysis.

PSmad2 level, with respect to KI, KIII, V0, and Ȗ.

4.2. Balance between Two Competing Effects Defines the Specific Cell Responses
Based on the previous discussion, the level of the nuclear transcription factor is not only
Smad-dependent, but also influenced by activated MAPKs. The effects of activated MAPKs on the
Smad pathway show two opposite responses: inhibition or enhancement of the nuclear transcription
factor concentration. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that the two opposite effects define specific
cellular responses to TGF-ȕ, that is to say, the balance between the two opposing effects defines
specific cellular responses to TGF-ȕ regulated by activity of the MAPK pathway.
In the literature, inhibition was observed mostly in hyperactive Ras signaling, oncogenic Ras
signaling or mutant tumor cells [14–17], whereas enhancement was observed mostly in normal
cells or in case of relatively low level of extracellular stimuli [1,9,11–13,27]. Massagué et al.
hypothesized that responses to TGF-ȕ may require balancing effects of Ras signaling to achieve a
suitable level of nuclear Smad activity [18]. The previously proposed hypothesis that the balance
between two opposite effects defines specific cellular responses not only agrees well with this
viewpoint, but also highlights the underlying kinetics: rapid activation of Erk, in the case of Erk,
induced by EGF or oncogenic Ras signaling, coupled with a high level of Ras activation, may
quickly attenuate R-Smad to inhibit the formation of the Smad complex in the cytoplasm before
R-Smad activation and nuclear translocation, which predominantly inhibits the Smad transcription
activity. Conversely, the delayed activation of Erk induced by TGF-ȕ or other extracellular factors
in some cells, coupled with a relatively low level of Ras activation, will be negligible for the R-Smad
activation and nuclear translocation. Most of PSmadL will transfer into the nucleus and inhibit the
dissociation of the nuclear Smad complex, which predominantly enhances the Smad transcription
activity. This hypothesized kinetics is in good agreement with the literature reports. Additionally,
the simulated data from the crosstalk model, as shown in Figures 4–7, seems to align with
this hypothesis.

39
4.3. Effects of Interaction Parameters on Cell Responses
The values of the interaction parameters KI and KIII are responsible for either inhibition or
enhancement of MAPKs on TGF-ȕ/Smad signaling. This section discusses whether specific
interaction outcome, either inhibition or enhancement, can be distinguished using experimental data.
4.3.1. Interaction Parameters Are Identifiable and have Distinct Effects on the Outputs
As far as a group of parameters to estimate are concerned, it is very possible that they are
pairwise indistinguishable. If the effects of two parameters on the output are highly correlated then
their sensitivity profiles have similar shapes. If this is the case then the parameters cannot be
simultaneously estimated. The sensitivity profiles of the nuclear PSmad2 level with respect to KI
and KIII are shown in Figure 8a. In addition, the relative levels of the transcription factor at
different values of each parameter (while the other parameters are held constant) are shown in
Figure 8b,c. It is clear from Figure 8a that the sensitivity profile for KI is distinctly different from
the sensitivity profile for KIII. It can be concluded that KI and KIII are estimable and each one has a
distinct effect on the output.

respect to KI and KIII; (b) the effect of KI on nuclear PSmad2 level; (c) The effect of KIII

40
4.3.2. MAPK Pathway Extends the TGF-ȕ/Smad Signal Transduction Duration, Which Is More
Strongly Affected by Values of KIII than KI
To provide further insight into the effects of the MAPK pathway on Smad signaling, signal time,
duration and amplitude at different values for each interaction parameter KI or KIII are calculated to
quantify the effect of the crosstalk on the output signal. As previously described, signal time,
duration, and amplitude will grow over time to infinity if the output signals do not return to zero.
Therefore, a pulse stimulation of TGF-ȕ (2 ng/mL) for the first 60 min is used for the following
analysis. Furthermore, a transient and low-level activation of MAPKs is assumed (V0 = 0.18,
Ȗ = 0.001) without time delay. Then the input signal, i.e., the TGF-ȕ concentration, is set to zero
after 60 min.
Figure 9 shows the signal time profiles (Figure 9a), signal duration profiles (Figure 9b) for
different values of the parameters KI and KIII. The signal time and duration decrease as KI or KIII
increase and converge to basal values equal to the signal time and duration of the original
TGF-ȕ/Smad pathway model. The signal time for KIII is significantly larger than that for KI as shown
in Figure 9a. According to the proposed hypothesis, the inhibition effect controlled by KI arises
from PSmadL activation in the cytoplasm, whereas the enhancement effect controlled by KIII only
becomes significant after PSmadL transfers from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. This implies that it
takes longer for the enhancement interaction involving KIII to have a noticeable effect than for the
inhibition interaction involving KI. The results shown in Figure 9a are in good agreement with this
hypothesis. On the other hand, the smaller the values of KI and KIII, the larger the signal time and
signal duration. That is to say, the stronger the crosstalk is, the longer it takes for the transcription
factor to be activated but the activation also lasts longer. It can be concluded that the crosstalk
between the pathways extends the duration of the TGF-ȕ/Smad signal transduction, which is
consistent with the literature reports [1,12]. Additionally, KIII has a more profound effect on the
signal time and signal duration than KI as can be seen in Figure 9a,b. A significant body of the
literature has reported that positive regulation of TGF-ȕ/Smad signaling by the MAPK pathway
enhances the duration of the increased levels of nuclear phosphorylated Smad2 [1,12], whereas
there are few reports mentioning down regulation. It is possibly that this is due to the fact that the
signal duration of PSmad2 level is predominantly controlled by KI and changes little under
negative regulation.
4.3.3. Specific Outcomes Can Be Described through Appropriate Choices for KI and KIII
The specific outcome, if signaling is enhanced or inhibited, depends upon the values of KI and
KIII. As such, it is important to investigate what combinations of values of these parameters have
an enhancing/inhibiting effect. The signal amplitude, representing the average concentrations of the
nuclear Smad complex, can be used as a measure to determine the magnitude of the effect. This
signal amplitude is computed for a number of values for combinations of KI and KIII. Small values
of KI, i.e., stronger interactions, result in low average concentrations of the transcription factor,
which illustrates the inhibition of TGF-ȕ/Smad signaling. Conversely, small values of KIII, i.e.,
strong interactions, result in large average concentrations of transcription factor, illustrating

41
enhancement of TGF-ȕ/Smad signaling. The variation amount of the signal amplitude I around its
basal value is defined to quantify the effect when both inhibition, via KI, and enhancement, via KIII,
take place:

VarI = I ( basal ) − I I ( K I )

(10)

VarIII = I III ( K III ) − I ( basal )

(11)

VarI and VarIII are the variation amounts of the signal amplitudes II (KI) and IIII (KIII) around
their basal value I (basal). If KI and KIII tend to infinity, the output signal tends to the basal value
which represents the original pathway without crosstalk. I (basal) is equal to the output signal
amplitude of the original TGF-ȕ/Smad pathway.
Figure 9. Signal time (a) and duration; (b) for different values of KI and KIII.

The interaction outcome is characterized by the values of VarI and VarIII: (1) If VarI = VarIII,
then the two interaction will cancel each other; (2) If VarI > VarIII, then inhibition is stronger than
enhancement; (3) If VarI < VarIII, then enhancement dominates inhibition. A plot of the surface of
the difference between VarI and VarIII as a function of KI and KIII is shown in Figure 10b. The grey
plane is added to divide the surface into two areas: overall inhibition and enhancement. The part
above the plane indicates that enhancement is stronger than inhibition while the area below the
plane represents the opposite effect.

5. Conclusions
Crosstalk plays a key role for TGF-ȕ signal transduction. Broad evidence exists for the crosstalk
of Smad signaling with MAPK pathways. A variety of studies have identified different potential
mechanisms for the crosstalk, however, there is no clear consensus on the actual mechanism(s)
responsible for the crosstalk.
A model of the pathways, including different potential crosstalk mechanisms, is developed
through integrating a model of MAPK pathway [22] with the TGF-ȕ/Smad pathway model [6]. The
effects that different interaction mechanisms have on the observed response are thoroughly analyzed
and discussed. It is hypothesized that two potential interaction mechanisms account for the
crosstalk between MAPK and GF-ȕ/Smad signaling pathways: (1) PSmadL attenuates R-Smad to
inhibit its association with C-Smad in the cytoplasm; (2) Nuclear PSmadL inhibits the dephosphorylation
and thereby the dissociation of the nuclear Smad complex. The two mechanisms explain the
inhibition and enhancement effects of MAPKs on Smad signaling. It is hypothesized that the
balance between these two competing effects defines specific cellular responses to TGF-ȕ,
depending on the cell types and the extent of MAPKs activation. This hypothesis agrees with
results from the literature reports [1,9,11–18,27].

The sensitivity of the transcription factor with respect to interaction parameters is calculated for
the presented model. It can be concluded that interaction strengths KI and KIII are estimable and
each one has a distinct effect on the output. Signal time, duration and amplitude at different
combinations of values of the interaction parameters KI or KIII are calculated to quantify the effect
of the crosstalk on the output signal. The results show that the MAPK pathway extends the
TGF-ȕ/Smad signal transduction duration, which is more strongly affected by the values of KIII than
KI. This conclusion agrees with the experimental reports from the literature [1,12]. Once the
interaction strengths KI and KIII have been estimated, the specific interaction outcome, inhibition or
enhancement, can be extracted from an analysis of the signal amplitudes.

Resolving Early Signaling Events in T-Cell Activation Leading
to IL-2 and FOXP3 Transcription
Jeffrey P. Perley, Judith Mikolajczak, Gregery T. Buzzard, Marietta L. Harrison and
Ann E. Rundell
Abstract: Signal intensity and feedback regulation are known to be major factors in the signaling
events stemming from the T-cell receptor (TCR) and its various coreceptors, but the exact nature of
these relationships remains in question. We present a mathematical model of the complex signaling
network involved in T-cell activation with cross-talk between the Erk, calcium, PKCθ and mTOR
signaling pathways. The model parameters are adjusted to ﬁt new and published data on TCR
trafﬁcking, Zap70, calcium, Erk and IκBα signaling. The regulation of the early signaling events by
phosphatases, CD45 and SHP1, and the TCR dynamics are critical to determining the behavior of the
model. Additional model corroboration is provided through quantitative and qualitative agreement
with experimental data collected under different stimulating and knockout conditions. The resulting
model is analyzed to investigate how signal intensity and feedback regulation affect TCR- and
coreceptor-mediated signal transduction and their downstream transcriptional proﬁles to predict the
outcome for a variety of stimulatory and knockdown experiments. Analysis of the model shows that:
(1) SHP1 negative feedback is necessary for preventing hyperactivity in TCR signaling; (2) CD45 is
required for TCR signaling, but also partially suppresses it at high expression levels; and (3) elevated
FOXP3 and reduced IL-2 signaling, an expression proﬁle often associated with T regulatory cells
(Tregs), is observed when the system is subjected to weak TCR and CD28 costimulation or a severe
reduction in CD45 activity.

1. Introduction
The actions of CD4+ T-cells are controlled by the stimulatory signals and cytokine milieu in their
surrounding tissue environment [1,2]. Extracellular signals naturally drive CD4+ T-cells to activate
and assume one of many important immunological roles, each characterized by a distinct proﬁle of
signaling events and cytokine secretion. These signals are processed by the intracellular signaling
pathways to alter the transcription proﬁles that direct T-cell activation and differentiation. To explore
this process from a quantitative perspective, a mathematical model is constructed from the known
molecular interactions and regulations.
This model encompasses the signal transduction events relating to the process of directing
gene expression that ultimately determine the actions or immunological role of the T-cell. This
process begins at the engagement of the T-cell receptor (TCR) to cognate peptide-bound major
histocompatibility complexes (pMHC) on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) [3–5].

51
TCR engagement triggers a number of early phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events. The
CD45 phosphatase primes the CD4 coreceptor-associated 56-kD lymphocyte-speciﬁc tyrosine
kinase (Lck), a member of the sarcoma (Src) family of kinases (SFK) [6,7], by removing
the inhibitory phosphate group from the Y505 residue [8,9]. Primed Lck is activated by
autophosphorylation at Y394, mediated by receptor clustering [9]. Activated Lck phosphorylates the
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) on the TCR-associated CD3 ζ-chain. The
zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 (Zap70) binds with high afﬁnity to doubly phosphorylated
ζ-chain ITAMs through its two Src homology 2 (SH2) domains and is activated by Lck-mediated
phosphorylation of its Y319 and Y493 residues [10–12]. Zap70 facilitates the activation of
phospholipase C-γ1 (PLCγ1), which hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2 ) to
second messengers diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3 ) [13–15]. IP3
migrates to the cytoplasm to regulate intracellular calcium (Ca2+ ) ﬂux from the endoplasmic
reticulum [13,16,17], a key modulator of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) [18]. While
IP3 migrates to the cytoplasm, DAG operates within the plane of the cell membrane to activate two
major signaling molecules: rat sarcoma (Ras) and protein kinase Cθ (PKCθ) [19]. Ras triggers the
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) cascade that results in the activation of activator protein 1
(AP1) [20], while PKCθ activates AP1 and the nuclear factor κB (NFκB) pathway [21–24]. Upon
entering the nucleus, transcription factors, such as NFAT, AP1, NFκB and others, interact to support
cooperative regulation of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and other genes involved in T-cell activation [25,26].
A critical second signal driving T-cell activation and fate determination is achieved by
incorporating CD28-mediated costimulation [27] and its downstream signaling events into the model.
In spite of the ability of the TCR to upregulate factors necessary for full activation, TCR-antigen
recognition ultimately leads to anergy or a state of hyporesponsiveness in the absence of a second
signal [28]. Alternatively, TCR signaling with additional costimulation of CD28 on the surface of
T-cells greatly enhances IL-2 production, T-cell proliferation and the prevention of anergy. This
synergistic effect is believed to be mediated through PKCθ and Akt (also known as protein kinase
B), which recruit and regulate several signaling molecules, including NFκB [23,29] and mammalian
target for rapamycin (mTOR) [30]. The serine/threonine protein kinase mTOR is another important
player in CD4+ T-cell activation. mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) has many known functions, including
the ability to control the expression of forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), a master transcriptional regulator
in the development of T regulatory cells (Tregs) [30,31]. While much less is known about mTORC2,
it was recently shown to promote PKC, Akt and NFκB signaling and to regulate T helper type 1
(Th1) and Th2 commitment [32].
A number of mathematical models exist that span the entirety or portions of these T-cell signaling
events. The models presented in [33,34] span these events and are able to capture many dominant
behaviors. However, these discrete-time logical models do not support a detailed analysis of the
interactions in a continuous state and parameter space and the ability to predict responses to analog
knockdown or mutation scenarios. Other models are very detailed, but only consider portions of
the system, such as the MAPK [35] and NFκB [36,37] pathways. Some of these models consider
every hypothesized molecular interaction or complex formation. This level of detail is prohibitive to

52
complete for the entire signaling network, predominantly due to computational tractability, but also
due to uncertainties in the existence or rates of these events. A few models set out to address the role
of location as a regulatory event, analyzing T-cell signaling events within a spatial context [38,39].
These models tend to be limited in scope in order to offset the added computational expense of such
an analysis. Our model differs from past approaches in that we consider a broad scope of early
TCR and CD28 signaling leading to gene transcription in continuous time, consider only the major
known phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, association and dissociation events and address location
through compartments and not as a partial differential equation with diffusion.
Here, we present a mathematical model of T-cell activation that focuses on the early steps in TCR
trafﬁcking and signal ampliﬁcation by kinases, phosphatases and other second messengers, as well
as CD28 coreceptor signaling and gene transcription of IL-2 and FOXP3. Sections 2 and 3 describe
the formulation of the model and its ﬁtting to training data. Model simulations and corroborating
experimental evidence are provided in Section 4, demonstrating the model’s ability to reproduce
many known experimental results. This section also describes predictions made by the model about
the roles of phosphatases CD45 and SHP1 in T-cell activation. Finally, conclusions are summarized
in Section 5.
2. Materials and Methods
This section provides an overview of the proposed T-cell activation model and details the
methods and materials employed in its development. These include the computational methods and
experimental datasets used for model parameter identiﬁcation.
2.1. The Mathematical Model: Overview and Scope
The mathematical model reﬂects the current understanding of the intracellular signaling
events leading to T-cell activation. The reaction scheme, as shown in Figure 1, encompasses
the primary events that occur upon TCR engagement and CD28 costimulation. Appendix 1
describes each signaling element and assigns a symbol and initial value for use in constructing the
mathematical model. Appendix 1 also lists the rate equations, parameter values and summarizes
the reactions primarily in terms of protein binding, phosphate group transfers and kinase and
phosphatase activation. The part of the model representing the TCR-mediated Erk pathway is
based on the ordinary differential equation (ODE) model developed by Zheng [40] with updates in
Perley et al. [41]. The Zheng model takes into account the major events of early T-cell signaling
leading to the activation of the protein tyrosine kinases Zap70 and SFK, the downstream Erk pathway,
as well as negative feedback regulation by phosphatase SHP1.

The Zheng model was extended to speciﬁcally incorporate TCR trafﬁcking, tuning of CD45
and SHP1 phosphatase activity, reﬁnement of Erk signaling with AP1 activation and the addition
of the calcium, NFκB and mTOR pathways leading to IL-2 and FOXP3 transcription. These
changes are further detailed in Section 3. Molecular association and complex dissociation are
designed to obey the law of mass action, i.e., assuming that the rate of a reaction is proportional
to the product of reactant concentrations. Most enzyme-catalyzed reactions utilize second-order
kinetics derived from a simpliﬁcation of the Michaelis–Menten enzyme kinetics by assuming that the
substrate concentration is limiting. Such a simpliﬁcation contributes to reducing the complexity of
the nonlinearities while retaining the structure of the pathway connectivity. For reactions catalyzed by
enzymes not explicitly included in this model, the expression further reduces to ﬁrst-order kinetics,
where the enzyme concentration becomes a constant. In addition, single molecular transitions are
also governed by ﬁrst-order kinetics. Alternatively, enzyme-catalyzed reactions in which cooperative
binding between substrates plays a signiﬁcant role utilize the Hill equation. Scenarios characterized
by these equations include the cooperative transcriptional regulation of IL-2 and FOXP3 and the
activation of certain enzymes. The model is also designed to mimic the cell response to stimulation
by αCD3, αCD28, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and the calcium ionophore ionomycin, as
well as mimic perturbations in kinase and phosphatase activity by various small molecule inhibitors.
The complete model consists of 48 ODEs with 154 reaction parameters and simulated in MATLAB
using the ode15s solver.
2.2. Global Sensitivity Analysis
Due to the size and complexity of the model, it is necessary to reduce the dimension of the
uncertain parameter space to facilitate an effective and computationally tractable analysis of the
model. Parameter sensitivity analysis provides a powerful tool for analyzing mathematical models
of complex biological systems and can be used to facilitate parameter estimation by identifying and
ranking the various contributors of parametric uncertainty in the model. Parameters with the lowest
sensitivity ranks, i.e., parameters whose uncertainty causes the least amount of variability in the
output space, can be neglected during the model ﬁtting process and ﬁxed at their initial guesses. For
the purpose of this study, a variance-based sensitivity analysis is used to determine how the model
output changes over the global parameter space:
Si,j =

var(E[yi |θj ])
var(E[yi ])

(1)

where Si,j is the sensitivity index of the i − th output to the j − th parameter. The sensitivity
indices are numerically computed using Sobol’s method by the efﬁcient sparse-grid-based algorithm
proposed by Buzzard [42,43]. Parameters having little effect on model outputs upon perturbation are
determined to be insigniﬁcant and ﬁxed at their nominal values. Signiﬁcant parameters are retained
for parameter identiﬁcation.

55
2.3. Parameter Identiﬁcation
The ability of the model simulated with a given parameter vector to reproduce available
experimental data is quantiﬁed by the objective function:


Ns

T
eti Wti eti with eti = C(ti )[y(ti ) − ŷ(ti )]
(2)
J(θ) = log10 1 +
i=1

where eti is the error at each sample time point, Wti is the inverse of the measurement error covariance
matrix at time ti , y(ti ) and ŷ(ti ) are the simulated model outputs and the mean values of the available
data at time ti , respectively, C(ti ) is a binary matrix that indicates which outputs are measured at
time ti and Ns is the total number of sampled time points. This cost function is computed in log
space in order to compress the range of and smooth the function, making its approximation with
sparse-grid interpolation more effective. The “1” in the cost function is added to avoid the singularity
of log at zero.
Speciﬁc parameter values that are capable of producing data-consistent model simulations are
extracted directly from the literature whenever possible. For those not found in the literature, they
are either derived using known conditions or constraints of the system or estimated from experimental
data using a combination of manual and automated calibration. First, the starting guess values are
roughly estimated by back-of-the-envelope calculations and manual tuning to within a reasonable
level of accuracy. This step is used to establish our parameter search space and its bounds, deﬁned
to be a hypercube spanning the nominal parameter vector by an order of magnitude both above
and below. Next, Equation (2) is evaluated at a number of samples from the parameter hypercube,
generated using Latin hypercube sampling in log space. Finally, starting from the parameter vector
with the lowest sampled cost, MATLAB’s nonlinear constrained optimization solver, fmincon,
is employed to identify the parameter vector that minimizes Equation (2) constrained within the
hypercube. To increase the chance of identifying the global minimizer, multiple starting points were
considered that span the region of low cost. This procedure of automated parameter identiﬁcation
is aided by the use of sparse-grid interpolation, a powerful tool for generating fast-evaluating
approximations of mathematical models [44].
2.4. Experimental Datasets for Model Development
Experimental datasets for the purposes of model development are compiled from the published
literature or generated from experiments performed in our lab speciﬁcally for this manuscript. For
datasets compiled from the published literature, only those that are commensurate with our model
in terms of cell type, stimuli, output species and time scale are considered. Table 1 summarizes
the attributes of the compiled datasets used to train the model. These datasets consist of dynamics
(i.e., time courses), dose response experiments (i.e., multiple doses of an input or stimulus) and
input response experiments (i.e., single doses of different input or stimuli combinations). In order
to compare the model and observed behaviors directly, simulations are generated to mimic the
experimental conditions used in our experimental set-ups (see Appendices 3 and 4) or as indicated

56
in the corresponding source articles. Model simulations are shown with the corresponding data and
error bars whenever possible; however, for cases in which data could not be visualized on the same
plot, the reader is referred to the original source.

3. Model Development
The following subsections describe the process of formulating the proposed T-cell activation
model as shown in Figure 1 from the original ODE model presented by Zheng [40]. These changes
include the incorporation of TCR trafﬁcking mechanisms, tuning of CD45 and SHP1 phosphatase
activity, reﬁnement of Erk signaling with AP1 activation and the addition of the calcium, NFκB and
mTOR pathways leading to IL-2 and FOXP3 transcription. These changes are further detailed in
the following subsections.
3.1. Modeling TCR Trafﬁcking
The TCR expression level at the cell surface is the result of a dynamic equilibrium maintained by
the membrane expression of newly synthesized TCR, receptor internalization, recycling to the cell
surface and degradation [46,47]. As depicted in Figure 1, the TCR complex is represented in the
model by ﬁve states: free TCR (T CRf ), ligand-bound TCR (T CRb ), phosphorylated ligand-bound
TCR (T CRp ), internalized TCR (T CRi ) and degraded TCR (T CRdeg ). TCR trafﬁcking is
modeled by allowing TCR complexes from all surface states (T CRf , T CRb and T CRp ) to be
internalized [38]. Internalized TCR subunits can be degraded or recycled back to the unbound
state. Newly synthesized TCR contributes to the free receptor state with a rate proportional to
degraded TCR.
Early studies demonstrated that the TCR is a constitutively cycling receptor [46,47]. Thus, at
steady state, a certain amount of TCR is endocytosed, while at the same time, an equal amount of
TCR is exocytosed. The associated model rate parameters are set by the following observations.
Several studies seem to agree that the constitutive endocytic rate constant for the TCR in resting
T-cells is ~0.01 min−1 , meaning that ~1% of the cell surface-expressed TCR is internalized each
minute [46].

57
TCR ligation induces downregulation and degradation of the TCR in a dose-dependent manner [45,46].
In theory, TCR downregulation can be accomplished by an increase in the endocytic rate constant,
a decrease in the exocytic rate constant or a combination of both. However, most studies found
that TCR downregulation is caused by an increase in the endocytic rate constant to ~0.038 min−1
after TCR triggering [46], whereas the exocytic rate was constant. In addition, TCR degradation
was also found to accelerate after TCR ligation. The TCR subunits in non-stimulated Jurkat cells
were observed to degrade with rate constants of ~0.0011 min−1 , resulting in a half-life of ~10.5 h.
Triggering of the TCR by anti-TCR Abs resulted in a three-fold increase in the degradation rate
constants to ~0.0033 min−1 , resulting in a half-life of ~3.5 h [45]. This process was modeled by
making the receptor internalization and degradation rate parameters functions related to T-cell
activation. These mechanisms were mathematically encoded in the model using:
k = kmin +

Xn
(kmax − kmin )
Xn + Kn

(3)

Equation (3) ensures a continuous transition between the constitutive endocytosis or degradation
rates (kmin ) and the ligand-induced rates (kmax ) using a Hill equation, where X is the induction
substrate concentration, K is the substrate concentration of the transition midpoint and n is the Hill
coefﬁcient denoting positive (n > 1) or negative (n < 1) cooperativity. Since the TCR cycling
pathway is dependent on the CD3γ di-leucine-based motif and is activated by PKC [46,47], for
receptor cycling, we set k = kint , X = [P KCθ], n = 2, and K is set to 5% of total PKCθ with
kmin = 0.01 min−1 and kmax = 0.038 min−1 . Since the activation of Lck and Zap70 leads to
recruitment of Cbl and ubiquitination (Ub) of the CD3 and ζ chains to induce degradation of the TCR
in the lysosomes [46], for receptor degradation, we set k = kdeg , X = [SF Kact] + [SF KactZapp] +
[SF KactS59p], n = 2, and K is set to 5% of total SFK with kmin = 0.0011 min−1 and
kmax = 0.0033 min−1 .
At equilibrium without any stimulus, most studies also seem to agree that the pool of recycling
TCR was distributed with approximately 75%–85% at the cell surface and 15%–25% inside the cells.
Assuming the minimum constitutive rates for internalization and degradation with 80% surface TCR
and 20% inside the cell, of which half are being degraded, we can compute the constitutive exocytosis
rate as kexo = 0.0789 min−1 and the constitutive synthesis rate as ksynth = kdegmin to achieve the
observed dynamic equilibrium in resting T-cells.
The resulting simulated surface and degraded TCR dynamics are consistent with expectations at
equilibrium and after receptor engagement with a ligand. The dose response curves in Figure 2A,B
show good agreement with the behaviors reported by Menne et al. [47], Geisler et al. [46] and
von Essen et al. [45].

3.2. Tuning the Roles of CD45 and SHP1
The protein tyrosine phosphatases, CD45 and SHP1, are central players in signal ampliﬁcation
following antigen recognition by the TCR and the activation of many downstream second messenger
and signaling molecules. CD45 is a leukocyte-speciﬁc transmembrane glycoprotein and a
receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) [8]. The SFK member Lck is the best characterized
CD45 substrate in T-cells [7]. Lck exists in dynamic equilibrium with three main sub-populations:
(1) open and activated (SF Kact in the model); (2) open and not activated (“primed”) (SF Kdp);
(3) closed and not activated (SF K) [9]. Phosphorylation of SFKs at the negative regulatory site
(Y505 in Lck) by the kinase Csk results in an intramolecular interaction with the SH2 domain,
creating a folded inactive conformation [48]. Dephosphorylation at this site by CD45 opens up
the molecule, creating a “primed” molecule. Clustering of these primed SFKs results in the
transphosphorylation of the activation loop (Y394 in Lck), which displaces it from the catalytic site
and creates an active kinase by allowing substrate access. Dephosphorylation at this site by CD45
or other PTPs, such as SHP1, downregulates SFK activity and returns them to the primed state [9].
Thus, CD45 functions as both a positive and negative regulator of the T-cell antigen receptor and in
setting the threshold of activation.
The dual role of CD45 as both positive and negative regulator of T-cell activation is modulated in
part by the distribution and movement of CD45 and its substrates proximal to the receptor complex
inside and outside lipid rafts. Lck inside lipid rafts has been reported to be hyperphosphorylated and
less active when CD45 is excluded [9]. The engineered inclusion of CD45 to the lipid domains also
decreases TCR signaling, consistent with its ability to downregulate signaling by dephosphorylating
the positive regulatory site at later time points [9]. These observations show that the localization
of both CD45 and the SFKs can affect the phosphorylation state of SFKs. It is believed that upon
receptor-mediated clustering, the SFKs are activated and often relocalize to lipid rafts, where the
concentration of CD45 is much lower and the kinases can experience sustained signaling. The later
recruitment of CD45 to these domains will then primarily dephosphorylate the activation site and
downregulate activity [9].

59
The model is augmented to include both the positive and negative regulatory roles of CD45,
as well as spatial localization effects, on T-cell activation with two explicit states: CD45p and
CD45n (see Figure 3). The ﬁrst, CD45p , reﬂects its ability to activate substrates immediately
following TCR triggering and promote signaling. Initially, this state exists at a high level with its
major role being to dephosphorylate negative regulatory sites and “prime” SFKs (R2 ). Following
TCR engagement, the receptor cluster formation (represented in simulation by ligand-bound TCR)
separates CD45 and its substrate. This causes CD45p to enter an ineffective state, an implicitly
modeled state called CD45 (R23 ), and decreases its ability to activate its substrate. The second state,
CD45n , represents the negative regulatory function of CD45 on SFK. Initially, this state is minimally
active with most existing in the inactive state, CD45. As TCR signaling progresses (represented in
simulation by activated SFK), CD45 is recruited back to the lipid rafts (R23a ), where its ability
to dephosphorylate activated SFKs is the dominant role (R3 , R4a , R22 and RT CRp ). Since CD45
can possess both positive and negative roles simultaneously, the species CD45p and CD45n are not
mutually exclusive; however, the intersection between these two sets, a CD45-related state possessing
both roles (CD45pn ), is not explicitly modeled or tracked. CD45tr , representing completely inactive
CD45 that is translocated away from its substrates, is also not explicitly modeled.
Figure 3. Representation of the phosphatase CD45 in the model. The model states
CD45p and CD45n are represented by the regions outlined in blue and red, respectively.
CD45pn , which is the intersection between the two modeled states outlined in purple,
has both positive and negative roles, but is not explicitly modeled. CD45tr represents
completely inactive CD45 that is translocated away from its substrates and is also not
explicitly modeled.

CD45np

In contrast to the dual role of CD45, Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-1
(SHP1) functions primarily as a negative regulator of TCR signal transduction. SHP1 associates
with and negatively regulates the Syk family kinase Zap70 upon T-cell activation (R8 and R9 ),
thereby suppressing TCR signaling [49]. SHP1 also forms a negative feedback loop that is composed

60
of (1) SHP1 phosphorylation by activated Lck, (2) binding of phospho-SHP1 to Lck and (3) Lck
inactivation by SHP1-mediated dephosphorylation (R3 ) [50]. Erk, on the other hand, antagonizes
SHP1 activity by modifying Lck (S59 phosphorylated by MAPK/Erk), which interferes with SHP1
recruitment and Lck inactivation [50,51]. These events are captured by partitioning the SFK states
with S59 phosphorylation (i.e., SF KdpS59p and SF KactS59p) from those without (R20 and R21 ).
Parameters for this updated model structure, which include reactions R1 -R10 and R20 -R23a , are
trained to recapitulate the behaviors and roles of CD45 and SHP1 in early TCR signaling. To
effectively isolate the early TCR signaling module from downstream feedback, the Erk positive
feedback loop is suppressed with the presence of the Mek1/2 inhibitor U0126. Figure 4 shows the
changes in the Zap70-Y319 phosphorylation level with different doses of αCD3 stimulation in the
presence of U0126. The results show that with increasing doses of stimulation, the response of Zap70
increases slowly initially, then rapidly between 2 and 5 μg/mL of αCD3 and eventually saturates
and even decreases slightly at the highest stimulus level (100 μg/mL). The dose response curve
demonstrates the existence of a threshold αCD3 stimulation concentration. Below the threshold level,
CD45 is unable to activate enough SFK and indirectly Zap70 to overcome the negative regulation by
SHP1 and CD45 itself to sustain signaling. Once the threshold is crossed, the negative feedback
barrier caused by SHP1 is overcome, and Zap70 signaling increases rapidly and eventually saturates
at a high stimulus level. The Zap70 dose response simulations show good agreement with the
observations originally reported by Zheng [40].

concentrations. Samples were taken 5 min post-stimulation and analyzed by western
blot. The data shown are the means and standard errors from at least three independent

3.3. Tuning Erk Signaling
The Erk signaling cascade plays an important role in IL-2 activation via the transcription factor,
AP1. Activated Zap70 mobilizes a number of adapter proteins to the receptor complex, including
linker of activated T-cells (LAT) and growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) [52]. Son of
Sevenless (SOS), a Ras guanine exchange factor (GEF), forms a complex with Grb2 and LAT to
facilitate the activation of Ras in T-cells. LAT also facilitates the activation of Ras through the RAS
guanyl nucleotide-releasing protein-1 (RasGRP1), which is itself activated by DAG [19]. Ras triggers
the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) cascade that results in the activation of AP1 [20]. As
mentioned in Section 3.2, Erk also promotes its own activation by phosphorylating Lck at S59 and
antagonizing SHP1 activity [50,51].
These reactions (R11 -R19 ) are modeled using the ﬁrst- and second-order mass action kinetic
equations of the base model presented by Zheng [40]. The kinetic parameters in this module are ﬁtted
to Erk phosphorylation data presented by Perley et al. [41]. Figure 5A,B shows the changes in the
Erk phosphorylation with different doses of the MKP inhibitor sanguinarine and Mek1/2 inhibitor
U0126. For each experiment, Jurkat cells were stimulated with 10 μg/mL αCD3, followed by a
dose of inhibitor once the indicated amount of time had past. Samples were taken before and after
the inhibitor dose administrations to show how the system changes over time with varying degrees
of inhibition. At the lowest concentrations (where inhibition is negligible), the transient nature of
Erk phosphorylation can be seen by the decreasing level over time. As the inhibitor concentrations
increase, a threshold is crossed, resulting in more forceful inhibition: 10 μg/mL for sanguinarine and
1 μg/mL for U0126. The phospho-Erk simulations show good agreement with the time course and
dose response observations originally reported by Perley et al. [41].

15 and 6 min post-stimulation (10 μg/mL αCD3), respectively. Samples of phospho-Erk
were taken at indicated times relative to the inhibitor doses and measured via western
blot. The data shown are the means and standard errors from at least three independent
experiments (data source: [41]).

3.4. Modeling Calcium Signaling
Calcium is an important second messenger involved in a number of cellular processes, including
the activation of NFAT and IL-2. PLCγ1, activated by Zap70 via LAT, hydrolyzes PIP2 to DAG
and IP3 (R13 ) [13–15]. IP3 migrates to the cytoplasm and interacts with IP3 receptors on the
endoplasmic reticulum, inducing the release of stored calcium (Ca2+ ) (R27 ) [13,16,17]. Calmodulin
(CaM), a small calcium-sensing protein and signal transducer, binds released Ca2+ ions (R28 ) and
undergoes a conformational change to activate the calcium-dependent serine-threonine phosphatase
calcineurin (CN) (R29 ) [53]. Activated CN dephosphorylates the nuclear factor of activated T-cell
(NFAT) proteins, exposing their nuclear-localization signal (NLS) and inducing nuclear translocation
(R30 ) [18].
The model is modiﬁed to recapitulate calcium signaling with these reactions (R13 , R27 -R30 ),
modeled using ﬁrst- and second-order mass action kinetic expressions similar to that of the Erk
signaling module. The kinetic parameters in this module are ﬁtted to Ca2+ ﬂux data for which the
experimental methodology is presented in Appendix 3. Figure 6 shows the experimental observations
of intracellular calcium in Jurkat cells stimulated with 10 μg/mL αCD3 and the corresponding model
simulation. Upon TCR stimulation, calcium ions are rapidly released from intracellular stores,
peaking after 2 min before returning to a slightly elevated level. It is evident from the plot that
the model readily captures the rapid transience of intracellular calcium ﬂux.

3.5. Modeling CD28 Costimulation
In spite of the ability of the TCR to upregulate many factors necessary for full activation,
TCR-antigen recognition ultimately leads to anergy, or a state of hyporesponsiveness, in the absence
of a second signal [28]. By contrast, signaling via CD28 on the surface of T-cells, in addition to TCR
signaling, greatly enhances IL-2 production, T-cell proliferation and the prevention of anergy. As a
result, CD28-mediated costimulation provides a critical second signal in T-cell activation and fate
determination [27]. CD28 signaling is believed to be mediated by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3 K)

63
(R33 ) [54]. PI3 K phosphorylates PIP2 to become phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3 ), an
activity that is directly antagonized by phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) (R34 ). PIP3 serves
as pleckstrin homology (PH) domain membrane anchors for 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1
(PDK1) (R35 ). PDK1 activation leads to the membrane recruitment of PKCθ (R36 ) and protein
kinase B (PKB, or Akt) (R40 ) to regulate several signaling pathways, including NFκB [23,29] and
mTOR [30].
The model is augmented to simulate the effects of CD28 costimulation on T-cell activation.
As with the other signaling modules, these reactions (R32 -R35 ) are modeled primarily using ﬁrstand second-order mass action kinetic expressions. The corresponding kinetic parameters are tuned
after accounting for downstream signaling events, such as NFκB and mTOR signaling, which are
described in the following sections.
3.6. Modeling NFκB Signaling
Several lines of evidence indicate that the NFκB pathway is perhaps the most relevant
biochemical or transcriptional target for the costimulatory activity of CD28 [29]. TCR- and
CD28-mediated induction of the NFκB signaling pathway intersect at the central regulator, PKCθ
(via mechanisms described in Section 3.5). PKCθ induces NFκB signaling by activating IκB kinase
(IKK) (R37 ) [21], which phosphorylates the inhibitor IκB (at positions S32 and S36). This triggers
the rapid polyubiquitination (at positions K21 and K22) and proteolysis of IκB in the 26S proteasome
complex (R38 ). IκB degradation exposes the nuclear localization signal of NFκB, allowing its rapid
translocation into the nucleus (R39 ) [23,24].
Physiologically, the deﬁning characteristic of IκBα is its ability to regulate rapid, but transient,
induction of NFκB activity, owing to the participation of IκBα in an autoregulatory feedback loop.
That is, the activation of NFκB causes the upregulation of transcription of IκBα, which, in turn,
serves to shut off its own nuclear localization signal [36,37]. This upregulation occurs due to the
presence of κB sites in the IκBα promoter. Thus, IκBα is thought to maintain the transient effect
of inducing agents on the transcription of NFκB responsive genes [23]. It was demonstrated that
in vivo degradation of IκBα is required for the appearance of NFκB in the nucleus. In addition,
some investigators were able to demonstrate by co-immunoprecipitating rel proteins with IκBα, from
stimulated cells treated with proteasome inhibitors to block the degradation of phosphorylated IκBα,
that IκBα undergoes degradation mediated by the 26S proteasome after phosphorylation, but before
dissociation [23].
We model the autoregulatory relationship between IκBα and NFκB (R38 and R39 ) as a
two-component negative feedback system:
˙
[pIκBα]
= [IKK] − α [pIκBα] − β [N F κB]
[N F˙κB] = γ [pIκBα] − δ [N F κB]

(4)

The dynamic behavior of the negative feedback depends on the relative efﬁciency of the feedback
regulation (α and β) regulating oscillation persistence versus self-regulation (γ and δ), causing
oscillation damping. The output, N F κB, can range from persistent oscillations (high feedback

64
efﬁciency and no damping, α = δ = 0) to gradual rising to a plateau level (low feedback efﬁciency
and high damping). Figure 7 demonstrates the phosphorylation of IκBα by IKK, subsequent
rapid degradation by the 26S proteasome and synthesis of IκBα promoted by nuclear NFκB. The
corresponding NFκB signal is also depicted. Model parameters are ﬁtted to phospho-IκBα data for
which the experimental methodology is speciﬁed in Appendix 4. In our case, the ﬁtted parameters
correspond to damped oscillations (intermediate feedback efﬁciency and intermediate damping).
Although we note that the sample size is small, the model simulation does show good agreement
with the trend seen in the data.

3.7. Modeling mTOR Signaling
Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is an evolutionary conserved serine/threonine protein
kinase that is well known for its ability to control T-cell activation and differentiation. mTOR is
necessary for TCR-induced signaling to drive differentiation into Th1, Th17 or Th2 effector types
in vitro or in vivo under polarizing conditions. On the other hand, mTOR-deﬁciency drives CD4+
T-cells to the generation of FOXP3+ T-cells, even under normal activating conditions [30]. The
ability of mTOR to regulate the expression of FOXP3 makes it a key player in the development of
Tregs [30,31].
TCR and CD28 costimulation leads to the membrane recruitment of Akt (via mechanisms
described in Section 3.5), where it is phosphorylated (at position T308) by PDK1 (R40 ). Activated
Akt phosphorylates tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) in an inhibitory manner, yielding a
separation of the TSC1/TSC2 complex (R41 ). This causes Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb)
to lose its GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity (R42 ). The resulting accumulation of Rheb-GTP
promotes mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) function (R43 ), which acts to downregulate FOXP3
expression (R47 ) [30]. By contrast, mTORC2 appears to be involved in cross-talk between Akt,
FOXP3, PKCθ and NFκB. mTORC2 was shown to promote phosphorylation of Akt (R40 ) and PKC
(R36 ), Akt activity, nuclear NFκB and to regulate Th1 and Th2 commitment in response to T-cell
activation [32].

65
The model is augmented with the described reactions (R40 -R47 ), which consist primarily of
ﬁrst- and second-order mass action kinetic expressions. Hill equations are employed in cases, such as
PTEN deactivation by TCR triggering (R45 ), TSC2 phosphorylation (R41 ) and IL-2 (R46 ) and FOXP3
(R47 ) transcription, to better describe apparent cooperativity between transcriptions factors [26,31].
Kinetic parameters are chosen to reproduce qualitative observations of Akt and PKC phosphorylation
in response to αCD3 and αCD28 costimulation originally reported by Lee et al. [32], the results of
which are shown in Figure 8. In the model, as with the data, while αCD3 and αCD28 are each
capable of inducing Akt and PKCθ phosphorylation, both are required to induce full activation of
these pathways.

4. Results and Discussion
The following results and discussion subsections are divided into two main groups. First, the
complete and calibrated model, as described in Section 3, is evaluated against additional data not
used in the model tuning process. This experimental evidence and corroboration of the model’s
predictive accuracy is described in Section 4.1. The sections that follow then describe predictions
made using the model. As mentioned in the introduction, these will mainly focus on the roles of
signal strength and feedback loops on the regulation of T-cell activation.

4.1. Model Corroboration
4.1.1. Experimental Datasets for Model Corroboration
Experimental datasets for the purposes of model corroboration are compiled from the published
literature. Only those that are commensurate with our model in terms of cell type, stimuli, output
species and time scale are considered. Table 2 summarizes the attributes of the compiled dataset.
Each dataset is used to analyze the model’s ability to recapitulate the dynamics of the biological
system as indicated. These datasets consist of dynamics (i.e., time courses), dose responses (i.e.,
multiple doses of an input or stimulus), input responses (i.e., single doses of different input or
stimuli combinations) and knockdown or knockout (i.e., activity of a particular species is reduced or
eliminated) experiments. In order to compare the model and observed behaviors directly, simulations
are generated to mimic the experimental conditions used in the published experimental set-ups.
Model simulations are shown with the corresponding data and error bars whenever possible.

4.1.2. Corroboration of Signaling Events and Transcription Factor Activation
In order to corroborate the model, we perform several in silico experiments and compare the simulations
to published experimental results (described in Table 2). Figure 9A shows the changes in the
intracellular calcium release in response to different combinations of stimuli. As shown in the
ﬁgure, only αCD3 and ionomycin are capable of inducing calcium signaling, with ionomycin
(administered with PMA) being the stronger of the two inducers. For the most part, the model
simulations are in good qualitative agreement with the observations reported by Smeets et al. [27];
however, there are two noticeable discrepancies. First, these data show that the model slightly
overestimates the system’s calcium sensitivity to ionomycin stimulation relative to that of αCD3.
Since the model is shown to ﬁt calcium signaling quite well (see Figure 6), more information on
the effects of ionomycin would likely resolve this issue. Second, the model’s predicted calcium
response demonstrates a slight sensitivity to PMA, a trend that is not observed in the data. This
model behavior is likely caused by the presence of the positive feedback loop mediated by Erk.
PMA is considered a DAG substitute, activating the substrates of DAG, such as RasGRP, which
leads to the activation of Erk. Erk, in turn, promotes signaling by preventing SFK from activating the
SHP1 negative feedback loop. In the model, the effect of elevated SFK facilitates further signaling
through LAT, PLCγ, IP3 and eventually calcium. This may be evidence that the model, particularly
the positive feedback loop, may be more sensitive than these experimental data suggest.

67
Figure 9B shows changes in nuclear translocation of NFAT, a downstream target of calcium
signaling, with varying doses of the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA). Model simulations
show excellent agreement with the observations reported by Clipstone et al. [53] in terms of
half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50 ) at ~3.5 ng/mL CsA. However, the model does appear
to be slightly less sensitive to changes in inhibitor concentrations, as the slopes of the two curves are
slightly different.
Figure 10 shows the activity of transcription factors NFAT, NFκB and AP1, as well as IL-2
synthesis in response to different combinations of stimuli. While there are a few obvious quantitative
discrepancies between the model simulations and the data presented by Smeets et al., there is good
qualitative agreement among them in the input/output relationships. Nuclear localization of NFAT is
only achieved when stimulating with combinations involving αCD3 (Figure 10A). This is because
NFAT translocation requires strong calcium signaling, which αCD28 and PMA stimulation alone
could not induce, consistent with [17] and Figure 9A. On the other hand, both αCD3 and PMA
are sufﬁcient to induce nuclear localization of NFκB and AP1 (Figure 10B,C). This is promoted by
αCD28, but a combination of αCD3 and PMA have the greatest inﬂuence on translocation. IL-2
transcription in response to these same stimuli is shown in Figure 10D. The results indicate that
TCR signaling is necessary for IL-2 transcription, but not sufﬁcient. Coupling with CD28 coreceptor
signaling causes a moderate increase in IL-2 transcription, but coupling with PMA results in the
greatest observed increase, consistent with [17,27]. These experimental results corroborate the model
and suggest that it is capable of accurately recapitulating the transcription proﬁles and, indirectly, the
upstream signaling pathways, for a wide variety of stimuli.

4.1.3. Corroboration of CD45 Activity
In this model, CD45 exists initially as fully active (proximal to the SFKs), then is deactivated
(translocates away from the SFKs) by the formation of the TCR complex. At later time points,
CD45 is reintroduced to the receptor cluster with an increased negative regulatory role. This results
in dephosphorylating active SFK and phosphorylated ligand-bound TCR, thus terminating the TCR
signal. Figure 11A depicts Lck-Y505 phosphorylation as a function of CD45 activity after 15 min
of stimulation. At normal expression levels (i.e., 100% of WT), Y505 phosphorylation is reduced
by approximately 75%. Phosphorylation at Y505 is inversely related to CD45 activity, which is
corroborated by the observations of McNeill et al. [55]. The model is able to approximate the data
from 100% WT activity down through 5% WT activity very well. Only when CD45 is completely
suppressed do the model and data diverge, although the trend is still present.
In CD45-null thymocytes, the p56Lck and p59Fyn tyrosine kinases are hyperphosphorylated,
and p56Lck is found in its inactive conformation [56]. Both basal and TCR-stimulated tyrosine
phosphorylation of TCRζ and CD3 are also much reduced. These defects are associated with
the failure of Zap70 kinase recruitment to the TCRζ chain; however, TCR-induced signaling is not
entirely ablated. Figure 11B shows Erk phosphorylation as a function of αCD3 stimulation and
CD45 activity. It is clearly evident that pErk increases with CD45 activity; however, above ~50%,
there is qualitative switch, and pErk begins to decrease as CD45 expression approaches wild-type
levels, which is also corroborated by observations by McNeill et al. [55].

Furthermore, signiﬁcant inositol phosphate and calcium signals are observed in CD45-null
thymocytes. In our simulation, the CD45 defect is approximated with a knockdown to 5% of WT
activity as complete CD45 knockout suppressed all signaling. Although greatly reduced from the
nominal system, calcium signaling does not appear to be insigniﬁcant in CD45-defective CD4+
T-cells (Figure 11C). The molecular analysis presented by Stone et al. suggests that the threshold
for TCR signal transduction is greatly increased in CD45-null T-cells, thus explaining the profound
defects in thymic development [56].
4.1.4. Corroboration of SHP1 Activity
SHP1 functions as a negative regulator by deactivating Zap70 and SFK upon T-cell
activation [49]. SHP1 also forms a negative feedback loop that is composed of SHP1 phosphorylation

70
by activated Lck, binding of phospho-SHP1 to Lck and Lck inactivation by SHP1-mediated
dephosphorylation [50]. To evaluate the ability of the model to capture the role of SHP1 feedback on
T-cell activation, we simulate the SHP1 knockdown experiment presented by [49]. Figure 12 shows
the stimulation of the IL-2 reporter with different combinations of stimuli and two different levels
of SHP1 activity. Model-simulated results and data are depicted by bars and dots, respectively. In
the wild-type system, neither PMA nor αCD3 alone are sufﬁcient to upregulate IL-2 transcription.
However, the combination of the two is able to generate a substantial signal. Pairing PMA with
ionomycin produces the maximally-observed signal. In the SHP1-knockdown system, IL-2 synthesis
is drastically increased as a result of αCD3 and PMA + αCD3 stimulation, thus demonstrating the
lack of inhibition. PMA + ionomycin stimulation is not affected by SHP1 knockdown because SHP1
functions upstream of their substrates: RasGRP1, PKCθ and calcium. The experimental results show
mostly good agreement with the model, suggesting that the model is able to adequately capture the
reported behavior of SHP1.

4.2. Weak CD28 Costimulation Predicted to Elevate FOXP3 Transcription
TCR signal intensity and costimulation is known to differentially affect the activation of T-cells.
We study this by performing a two-way dose response experiment, measuring the effects of αCD3
and αCD28 on IL-2 and FOXP3 transcription. Figure 13A,B shows IL-2 and FOXP3 transcription,
respectively, following 30 min of stimulation by various combinations of αCD3 and αCD28. At
trivial doses of both stimuli, neither species is active, indicating that the cell is at rest. At high doses
of both stimuli, IL-2 is the dominant species, indicating that the cell is fully active. However, when
costimulation through CD28 is relatively weak, the balance of dominance shifts toward FOXP3,
while leaving IL-2 at a much reduced level. Indeed, this behavior is corroborated by the observations

71
by Kretschmer et al. [57] that weak TCR signals and limited costimulation have been linked to
FOXP3 induction and the development of the regulatory phenotype in CD4+ T-cells.

4.3. Reduced CD45 Activity Predicted to Elevate FOXP3 Transcription
We investigate the roles of CD45 and SHP1 on T-cell activation by simulating a two-way
knockdown response experiment and measuring the effects on a small number of important outputs.
Figure 14A–F show the model response to various CD45- and SHP1-knockdown scenarios. SHP1
clearly has the effect of downregulating most species playing a role in T-cell activation. As
SHP1 activity is reduced (i.e., moving top to bottom on the right axis in each plot), calcium,
Erk, PKCθ and IL-2 are all upregulated. This is due to the loss of their transient behaviors and
constitutive activation at elevated levels. For CD45, on the other hand, the analysis demonstrates
a dual role as both activator and inhibitor of T-cell activation. As CD45 activity is reduced
(i.e., moving right to left on the top axis in each plot), TCR signaling increases until CD45 activity
reaches ~1%–10% of the wild-type, then decreases to complete inactivation as CD45 is completely
suppressed. This result indicates that CD45 is required for TCR signaling, without which the pool
of SFKs would remain in the closed and inactive state; however, the highest level of activation is not
actually achieved for wild-type CD45 expression, but rather at a reduced rate between approximately
1%–10% of the wild-type with intact SHP1 activity. Stronger TCR signaling can be achieved at full
CD45 activity by downregulating SHP1.
It is evident that the system is quite sensitive to CD45 activity, particularly at the lower end
of expression. By contrast, SHP1 is much more effective closer to wild-type levels; however,
its activity is heavily dependent on the presence or absence of CD45. The results suggest that
there exists a distinct threshold of CD45 activity (~1% of WT) that may be critical to determining
the outcome of TCR-mediated activation. Below this threshold, the system is presumably unable
to activate with every state remaining at baseline. However, at the threshold and above, the
signaling molecules relating to Th development become active and the system is rescued. Recently,

72
McNeill et al. reported that only 3% of normal CD45 activity is sufﬁcient to reconstitute
CD45-deﬁcient mice with normal numbers of mature T-cells, biased toward CD4+ T-cell lineage
commitment [55].

CD45 also appears to have an effect on the activation of FOXP3. At total CD45 suppression,
the cell remains unresponsive, even at full stimulation. For wild-type activity, TCR signaling
promotes mTORC1 activation, thereby also suppressing FOXP3. However, a reduction in CD45
activity to around the aforementioned threshold actually induces a substantial upregulation in
FOXP3 expression while IL-2 remains low. This may be due to the transcriptional regulators of
FOXP3 becoming sufﬁciently induced, while signaling remains too low to promote mTOR-mediated
inhibition. This result suggests that CD45 downregulation may lead to weak IL-2 induction and
increased FOXP3 expression, which is often observed in Treg lineage commitment.
5. Conclusions
Signal intensity and feedback regulation are known to be major determinants of the signaling
proﬁle for the TCR and its various coreceptors. While the exact nature of these relationships remains
under investigation, it is believed to involve a complex signaling network with cross-talk between the
calcium, Erk, PKCθ and mTOR signaling pathways.

73
In this manuscript, we present a mathematical model encompassing the signal transduction events
relating to the process of TCR-mediated cell activation and gene expression. The model is able to
reproduce key behaviors in: (1) ligand-induced TCR trafﬁcking, synthesis and degradation; (2) early
kinase and phosphatase interactions between SFK, Zap70, CD45 and SHP1; (3) CD28 costimulation;
and (4) downstream signal transduction pathways leading to IL-2 and FOXP3 synthesis, including
calcium, Erk, PKCθ and mTOR.
In addition to corroborating many experimentally-observed behaviors, the model is able to
provide insight into the positive and negative regulatory roles of the phosphatases CD45 and SHP1
during T-cell activation. Analysis of the model demonstrates that: (1) SHP1 negative feedback is
necessary for preventing hyperactivity in TCR signaling; (2) CD45 is required for TCR signaling,
but also partially suppresses it at high activity levels; and (3) elevated FOXP3 and reduced IL-2
signaling, an expression proﬁle often observed in developing Tregs, can be achieved either by weak
TCR and CD28 stimulation or a severe reduction in CD45 activity. However, we do note that further
investigation and experimental evidence is required in order to corroborate these predictions.
While the proposed model is a demonstrably powerful tool for predicting many events involved
in CD4+ T-cell activation, there are certain caveats that need to be considered to accurately deﬁne the
model’s scope and capability. First, as a ﬁnite mathematical approximation, this model is inherently
an abstraction of the biological reality. As such, the model does not attempt to explain every possible
mechanism involved in the processes in question. For example, the Foxo family protein, Foxo1, is
thought to bind to the FOXP3 locus and induce FOXP3 gene transcription. Foxo1 activity is subject
to modulation by Akt kinase signaling, and Tregs have dampened Akt signaling in response to TCR
stimulation compared with conventional T-cells. However, it is not within the scope of this work to
test and corroborate every one of these mechanisms. Second, the purpose of the model is to simulate
the dynamics of a small number of key species involved in T-cell activation or, more speciﬁcally, and
clinically relevant, activation of human primary CD4+ T lymphocytes. Due to practical limitations
on the availability of experimental data, however, the model is partially calibrated with datasets from
alternate sources, including Jurkat cells. While Jurkat cells are an immortalized cell line of human
T lymphocytes, they share many similarities with their primary counterparts and are very useful in
studying T-cell signaling and IL-2 production. However, we do recognize that this constitutes an
amalgamation of data from a variety of sources and that further investigation using primary T-cells is
highly desirable.
As demonstrated in this manuscript, the mathematical model captures the key events in TCR
and CD28 co-mediated signal transduction events leading to IL-2 and FOXP3 activation. As such,
the model enables researchers to study these processes with a combination of broad scope, using
a large-scale highly-connected network and with quantitative detail and accuracy not allowed by
comparable models. In the future, we plan to use this mathematical model to design informative and
hypothesis-driven experiments to reﬁne our understanding of the dynamical nature of CD4+ T-cell
activation. Our goal is to use such a model as a foundation for the design of strategies to drive and
control T-cell activation and differentiation for therapeutic gain.

Appendix 2: Parameter Sensitivity Analysis
Figure A1 shows the results of the parameter sensitivity analysis used to determine which
parameters should be considered for parameter identiﬁcation. The sensitivity indices are standardized
by rows, enabling the parameters to be ranked for each model state independently. For a given
model state, a value shown in red denotes that the state is relatively sensitive to perturbations in the
corresponding parameter. On the other hand, a value shown in green implies that the particular state
is insensitive to the parameter in question. As shown in Figure A1, it can be common for certain
states to be only sensitive to a fraction of the parameters. This blocking structure is leveraged during
the parameter identiﬁcation process to reduce the dimension of the uncertain parameter space when
calibrating individual modules.
Appendix 3: Calcium Flux Measurements
Jurkat T leukemia cells (Jurkat clone E6.1; ATCC) were harvested in log phase growth
(4–8 × 105 cell/mL), washed once with Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) without phenol red.
Phenol red-free, calcium containing HBSS (Lonza) was used for the remainder of the experiment.
Cells were resuspended at 2 × 106 cells/mL in HBSS supplemented with 2.5 mM probenecid
(unloaded control) or in HBSS with 1 μM Fluo-4 AM, 2.5 mM probenecid and 10 μL/mL PowerLoad
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA). Cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark.
Following incubation, cells were washed twice with 1 mL HBSS with 2.5 mM probenecid and then
resuspended in 100 μL HBSS plus 2.5 mM probenecid. Cells were loaded into a black-walled,
clear bottom 96-well plate. Wells with cells were surrounded two wells deep with 100 μL water
each as a temperature buffer. The plate was covered in foil, and cells were allowed to settle for
5 min at 37 ◦ C.

Fluorescence was measured on a BioTek plate reader (BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA)
using the following parameters: excitation wavelength, 495 nm; emission, 520 nm; temperature,
37 ◦ C. Prior to stimulation, a background reading was taken. The plate was ejected from the plate
reader and 10 μg/mL αCD3 or 1 μg/mL ionomycin (positive control) were added to the wells using
a repeat dispense pipette. Following the addition of stimulants, a kinetic measurement run was done
over 5–10 min, measuring ﬂuorescence every 10 s. From the obtained data, the background reading
was subtracted.
Appendix 4: Phospho-IκBα Measurements
Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) supplemented with
7.5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Bio-West, Logan, UT, USA), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 12.5 mM HEPES pH 7.4 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA),
12 μM sodium bicarbonate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 50 μg/mL streptomycin and 50 units/mL penicillin in an
incubator at 37 ◦ C in humidiﬁed air containing 5% carbon dioxide. Cells were harvested in log-phase
growth at a density of 1 × 107 cells per treatment. The treatments were stimulated with either
2 μg/mL αCD3 or 2 μg/mL αCD3 plus αCD28 in a 37 ◦ C water bath for up to 30 min. Samples of
1 × 106 cells were taken at the indicated time points and lysed in 1% NP40 lysis buffer (1% NP40,
25 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM NaV, 10 mM NaF, 10 μg/mL each of
aprotinin and leupeptin) for 15 min on ice. Lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 18,000× g at 4 ◦ C.
The supernatant was added to the same volume of 2X protein solubilizing mixture (PSM, 25% (w/v)

81
sucrose, 2.5% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, 25 mM Tris, 2.5 mM EDTA, 0.05% bromophenol blue)
and boiled for ﬁve min. Proteins were separated via SDS-PAGE, blotted for α-tubulin, phospho-IκB
(S32/36) and IκB (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA). IRDye 800 and 680 secondary
anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, OR, USA) were used for signal
detection using an Odyssey infrared scanner. Blot images were analyzed using ImageJ to produce
quantitative data for model comparison.

Mathematical Modeling of Pro- and Anti-Inflammatory
Signaling in Macrophages
Shreya Maiti, Wei Dai, Robert C. Alaniz, Juergen Hahn and Arul Jayaraman
Abstract: Inflammation is a beneficial mechanism that is usually triggered by injury or infection and
is designed to return the body to homeostasis. However, uncontrolled or sustained inflammation can
be deleterious and has been shown to be involved in the etiology of several diseases, including
inflammatory bowel disorder and asthma. Therefore, effective anti-inflammatory signaling is
important in the maintenance of homeostasis in the body. However, the inter-play between pro- and
anti-inflammatory signaling is not fully understood. In the present study, we develop a mathematical
model to describe integrated pro- and anti-inflammatory signaling in macrophages. The model
incorporates the feedback effects of de novo synthesized pro-inflammatory (tumor necrosis factor Į;
TNF-Į) and anti-inflammatory (interleukin-10; IL-10) cytokines on the activation of the transcription
factor nuclear factor țB (NF-țB) under continuous lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation (mimicking
bacterial infection). In the model, IL-10 upregulates its own production (positive feedback) and also
downregulates TNF-Į production through NF-țB (negative feedback). In addition, TNF-Į
upregulates its own production through NF-țB (positive feedback). Eight model parameters are
selected for estimation involving sensitivity analysis and clustering techniques. We validate the
mathematical model predictions by measuring phosphorylated NF-țB, de novo synthesized TNF-Į
and IL-10 in RAW 264.7 macrophages exposed to LPS. This integrated model represents a first step
towards modeling the interaction between pro- and anti-inflammatory signaling.

1. Introduction
Inflammation is a beneficial self-defense mechanism that is initiated by the body to eliminate
pathogens and prevent the spread of infection [1]. The inflammatory responses to pathogens and
other inflammatory stimuli are mediated by innate (dendritic cells and macrophages) and adaptive
immune cells (T-cells and B-cells) [2]. Immune cells have transmembrane receptors called Toll-like
receptors (TLR) that recognize foreign molecules based on pathogen-associated molecular patterns
(PAMPs), such as flagellin of bacterial flagella [3], lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Gram-negative
bacteria and peptidoglycan of Gram-positive bacteria [4]. Recognition of PAMPs by immune cells
(such as macrophages) triggers the production and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which
leads to the recruitment of phagocytic cells, such as neutrophils [5], for eliminating pathogens. While
inflammation is a beneficial body response, unabated (chronic) inflammation is deleterious, as it can
result in immune cells attacking other host cells. Chronic inflammation has been shown to be
involved in the etiology of several diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [6] and
asthma [7]. Chronic inflammation can also arise in the absence of pathogen infection. Since the

86
mucosal immune cells in the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract are in close proximity with intestinal
microbiota [8], any alteration in the intestinal microbial community (i.e., dysbiosis) can also lead to
uncontrolled pro-inflammatory responses. This sustained inflammation in the absence of any
infection has been shown to result in ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease [6].
Nuclear factor-țB (NF-țB) is an important transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in
mediating inflammatory responses in immune cells, such as macrophages [9]. NF-țB is made up of
two subunits, p50 and p65 [10], and is sequestered as an inactive complex in the cytosol by an
inhibitor protein, IțBĮ [9]. When macrophages detect the presence of bacteria (by detecting LPS)
through their cell surface receptor, TLR4, an LPS-TLR4 complex is formed that triggers the
activation of IțBĮ kinase (IKK), resulting in phosphorylation of IțBĮ-NFțB and subsequent
ubiquitination and degradation of IțBĮ [9]. NF-țB, which is catalytically released from the inactive
IțBĮ-NFțB complex, translocates into the nucleus and binds to response elements in the promoter
region of its target genes to activate their transcription [9]. Several target genes with functions in
inflammation and immune regulation have been identified for NF-țB [11], of which TNF-Į and
IL-10 are the most prominent pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, respectively [12–14]. In addition
to TNF-Į and IL-10, other NF-țB responsive genes that have significant NF-țB regulatory functions
are IțBĮ (sequesters free NF-țB) [15] and A20 (inactivates IKK) [16]. However, NF-țB is not the
only transcription factor that regulates IL-10 and TNF-Į signaling and often acts in concert with
other transcription factors. For example, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)
is a well-studied transcription factor involved in IL-10 signaling [17,18]. STAT3 not only regulates
transcription of IL-10, but is itself activated by IL-10 [19] and LPS [20] in a feedback manner. The
effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-Į and IL-1β, are countered by signaling initiated
by anti-inflammatory cytokines. IL-10 is a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine and suppresses the
production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, like TNF-Į [21], by downregulating NF-țB through
inhibition of IKK activation and suppression of free phosphorylated NF-țB translocation from
cytosol to nucleus [22,23].
Several computational models of inflammatory signaling have been previously developed. These
include a model for the IL-6 signal transduction pathway by Singh et al. [24], the TNF-Į signaling
pathway by Huang et al. [25], Lipniacki et al. [26], Rangamani et al. [27] and Hoffmann et al. [28].
A characteristic feature of these models is that they describe the dynamics of signaling initiated by a
single pro-inflammatory cytokine. Moya et al. [29] developed a mathematical model to represent
interactions between IL-6 (pro-inflammatory) and IL-10 (anti-inflammatory) in hepatocytes when
both of these cytokines were used as stimuli to the cells. The current work describes an interplay
between de novo synthesized pro-inflammatory (TNF-Į) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines in
macrophages exposed to LPS (Figure 1). Since the inter-play between the pro- and anti-inflammatory
signaling in macrophages is poorly understood, our integrated model represents a first step towards
modeling the interaction between pro- and anti-inflammatory signaling mediators that is important
in inflammation and maintaining homeostasis.

Figure 1. Schematic representation of NF-țB signal transduction pathway under LPS
stimulation in macrophages. LPS binds to cell-surface TLR4, forms the LPS-TLR4
complex that initiates activation of IKK, subsequent rapid phosphorylation and
dissociation of the IțBĮ-NFțB complex. Phosphorylated IțBĮ undergoes degradation,
whereas free cytoplasmic NF-țB translocates into the nucleus, binds to DNA response
elements and initiates the transcription of target genes TNF-Į, IL-10, IțBĮ and A20. De
novo synthesized TNF-Į and IL-10 are secreted into the cell culture supernatant, where
they bind to their respective cell surface receptors and initiate their positive (TNF-Į) and
negative (IL-10) feedback regulations on NF-țB. The LPS-induced NF-țB signaling
pathway is indicated in solid blue arrows. TNF-Į-induced positive feedback regulation
of NF-țB is indicated in dashed cyan arrows, and IL-10-induced negative feedback
regulation of NF-țB is indicated in solid red lines.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Model Formulation
The mathematical model presented in this paper is an integration of an inflammatory module and
an anti-inflammatory module. The model is developed by representing biochemical reactions
involved in the signal transduction pathway (Figure 2) as a set of non-linear ordinary differential
equations (ODE) of the form:
݀‫ݔ‬
ൌ ݂ሺ‫ݔ‬ǡ ‫ݑ‬ǡ ‫݌‬ሻ
݀‫ݐ‬

(1)

where x is a vector of states, u is a vector of inputs and p is a vector of parameters. The model
comprises 29 differential equations (Table 1) and 37 parameters (Table 2). Each differential equation
represents the rate of change of the concentration of a particular protein involved in the pathway.

88

Figure 2. Implemented reaction network for the LPS-induced NF-țB signal transduction
pathway with TNF-Į (positive) and IL-10 (negative) feedback regulation.
The inflammatory (TNF-Į) module is adapted from Huang et al. [25] and Lipniacki et al. [26].
While these models use TNF-Į as the input, our model describes LPS (input)-induced signaling
through TLR4 (LPS receptor), which leads to TNF-Į production. Besides adding TLR4 to the model,
the TNF-Į receptor description is retained to represent the positive feedback of de novo synthesized
TNF-Į on NF-țB regulation. We have included a kinetic term for TNF-Į mRNA transcription
initiated by nuclear NF-țB and component balances for TNF-Į in the cytoplasm and the supernatant.
In addition, Lipniacki et al., included TRADD, TRAF2, RIP-1, FADD, caspase-3 and caspase-8
proteins, which are left out of the model presented here, as we focused only on some of the key
biochemical reactions involved in LPS-induced NF-țB activation, its effect on the production of
TNF-Į and IL-10 and, in turn, the role of these cytokines on the feedback regulation of NF-țB. The
similarities between the model described in Lipniacki et al. [26], and our current ODE model lie in
the formulation of the biochemical reactions involved in IKK activation, IțBĮ-NFțB
phosphorylation, dissociation and nuclear transport of NF-țB, nuclear NF-țB-induced IțBĮ, A20
mRNA transcription, free NF-țB sequestration by de novo synthesized IțBĮ and IKK inactivation
by A20. We added a balance for phosphorylated IțBĮ, as it is known to degrade after dissociation
from the IțBĮ-NFțB complex.

The anti-inflammatory (IL-10) module is adapted from the IL-6 and IL-10 model by Moya et al. [29].
Only the ODEs involved in IL-10 signaling through the IL-10 receptor (as mentioned in Moya et al. [29])
are included in the anti-inflammatory module of our current model to formulate the feedback effects
of IL-10 on its own production (through positive feedback regulation of STAT3) and TNF-Į
production (through negative feedback regulation of NF-țB). Biochemical reactions, as described in
Moya et al., for STAT3 phosphorylation, dimerization and nuclear translocation to initiate
transcription are retained in our current model. Transcription and translation of SOCS3 due to STAT3
and downstream biochemical reactions associated with SOCS3 are not included in the model
presented here. A Michaelis–Menten-type kinetics for IL-10 transcription, initiated by the
transcription factors, NF-țB and STAT3, and component balances for IL-10 in the cytoplasm and
supernatant, have been included here.
Some values of the parameters (Table 2) and initial concentrations of proteins (Table 3) are
adapted from the TNF-Į signaling models by Huang et al. [25], Lipniacki et al. [26],
Rangamani et al. [27], Hoffmann et al. [28] and the IL-6 and IL-10 model by Moya et al. [29]. The
previously developed models consisted of 37 differential equations and 60 parameters for the
TNF-Į model by Huang et al. and 68 differential equations and 118 parameters for the IL-6 and
IL-10 model by Moya et al. [29] Among the proteins included in these models, very few are
quantifiable by experimental methods, making parameter estimation difficult. In our current
integrated model, we have reduced the number of differential equations to 29 and the number of
parameters to 37 by only focusing on the key proteins of the pathway. Using a smaller model increased
parameter identifiability and simplified parameter estimation.
The ODE model is structurally divided into pro-inflammatory (TNF-Į) and anti-inflammatory
(IL-10) modules that are both initiated by LPS stimulation and NF-țB activation. Below is the
description of the implemented reaction network as shown in Figure 2.
Pro-Inflammatory Module:
(1) Exogenous LPS binds to the cell surface receptor (TLR4);
(2) LPS-TLR4 complex initiates activation of IKKneutral to IKKactive;
(3) IKKactive phosphorylates IțBĮ-NFțB and initiates dissociation of the inactive IțBĮ-NFțB
complex into phosphorylated IțBĮ and NF-țB species;
(4) Free phosphorylated IțBĮ undergoes ubiquitination and degradation, whereas free
cytoplasmic NF-țB translocates into nucleus;
(5) Nuclear NF-țB binds to response elements in the promoter regions of TNF-Į, IțBĮ and A20
genes and leads to transcription and translation of the corresponding proteins and subsequent
secretion of TNF-Į into the supernatant. de novo intracellular IțBĮ sequesters both free
cytoplasmic and nuclear NF-țB by binding to them, and A20 catalyzes the change of IKKactive
to the IKKinactive form;
(6) Secreted TNF-Į in the cell culture supernatant binds to its cell surface receptor to form a
complex that initiates similar pathways as LPS, resulting in the production of more TNF-Į
through a positive feedback regulation on NF-țB.

Anti-Inflammatory Module:
(1) Nuclear NF-țB binds to the IL-10 gene promoter and initiates transcription of IL-10 mRNA
and subsequent translation into IL-10 protein in the cytoplasm, which gets secreted into
the supernatant;
(2) IL-10 secreted into the supernatant binds to its cell surface receptor, forming a ligand-receptor
complex that inhibits activation of IKKneutral to IKKactive and translocation of activated free
cytoplasmic NF-țB into the nucleus, as well;
(3) The IL-10 + receptor complex activates a second transcription factor, presumably STAT3,
which, in turn, regulates transcription of the IL-10 gene in a feed-forward manner.

93
Different LPS concentrations (0, 0.1, 1, 10 ȝg/mL) are used to stimulate the model. The IKK
complex and NF-țB dimer (p50–p65) are considered as single proteins in the model. The signal
transduction model comprises feedback regulatory loops involving TNF-Į and IL-10. The positive
feedback of TNF-Į on its own production is represented by de novo TNF-Į binding to its cell surface
receptor, activating IKKneutral to IKKactive, leading to phosphorylation and dissociation of the
IțBĮ-NFțB complex to release NF-țB, which translocates to the nucleus to initiate transcription of
TNF-Į. IL-10 has a negative feedback effect on TNF-Į production by inhibiting NF-țB activation
(phosphorylation and dissociation), and the extent of this inhibition is calculated on the basis of the
ligand bound IL-10 receptor complex (IL10-IL10R) concentration, which is represented as kin
(Equation (2)):
kin = max [ሺͳ െ

ሾ୍୐ଵ଴ି୍୐ଵ଴ୖሿ
ሾ୍୐ଵ଴ି୍୐ଵ଴ୖ୫ୟ୶ሿ

ሻǡͲ]

(2)

The maximum attainable concentration of IL10-IL10R is denoted by IL10-IL10Rmax with an
assumed value of 2.56 × 10í6. kin is multiplied by factors that are inhibited by IL-10, such as IKK
activation and nuclear translocation of free cytoplasmic NF-țB [22,23] (Table 1). The higher the
concentration of the IL10-IL10R complex, the lower will be the value of kin and, hence, the lower
will be the contribution of the terms mentioned above to the total outcome of NF-țB signaling,
resulting in suppression of TNF-Į production by IL-10. Positive feedback of IL-10 on its own
production is represented by a set of differential equations that describe the IL-10 bound receptor
complex phosphorylating transcription factor STAT3, which then dimerizes and translocates into the
nucleus, binds to the promoter region of the IL-10 gene and initiates transcription of IL-10 mRNA
and subsequent translation and secretion of IL-10 protein.
2.2. Parameter Selection and Estimation

where yik and ǔik are the simulated and measured output data of the i-th component at sampling
time tk, respectively (Equation (3)); p are the parameters to be estimated, which are selected by local
sensitivity analysis; x are the state variables of the dynamic system with initial values x0; and u are
the inputs to the system (Equation (4)). In addition, the state variables x and parameters p are restricted
within certain ranges, as shown in Equations (6) and (7), determined by the underlying biology and
prior knowledge based on mathematical models developed by Lipniacki et al. [26], Huang et al. [25]
and Rangamani et al. [27].

Figure 3. Algorithm for parameter estimation used to optimize model parameters. An
optimization algorithm is applied in an outer loop, while the evaluation of the objective
function and its gradients are performed by numerical integration of the ODEs in the
inner loop. fmincon (MATLAB function) is used as the NLP (non-linear programming)
solver and ode15s (MATLAB function) is used as the ODE integrator.
The simulated output vector y (Equation (5)), which is validated by experimental data, includes
the intracellular ratio of phosphorylated NF-țB to total NF-țB (relative to the control) and the
concentration of the cytokines, TNF-Į and IL-10, in the cell culture supernatant. Since the
experiments are conducted with four different levels of the input u (i.e., different concentrations of
LPS), four sets of measured outputs ǔik are obtained. Three sets of data obtained for 0, 0.1 and 1
μg/mL LPS stimulations are used for parameter estimation, and the fourth dataset for 10 μg/mL LPS
stimulation is used for model validation.
First, the set of parameters that are to be estimated are selected by local sensitivity analysis and
hierarchical clustering. Following this, the trust-region optimization technique is used to estimate the
selected parameters. This technique is used in this work, as it is able to handle singular Hessian
matrices, significant uncertainty in the parameters of the models and noisy data. In this technique, an
optimization algorithm is applied in an outer loop, while the evaluation of the objective function and
its gradients are performed by numerical integration of the ODEs in the inner loop [32,33] (shown in
Figure 3). The trust-region method is guaranteed to converge to local optima with much weaker
assumptions than line search methods. In this work, fmincon (MATLAB function) is used as the NLP
(non-linear programming) solver and ode15s (MATLAB function) is used as the ODE integrator. It
is worth noting that ode15s is specifically designed for stiff systems, such as the model discussed
here, where both fast and slow dynamics exist, e.g., in our system, phosphorylation of NF-țB is a
much faster process than de novo synthesis of TNF-Į and IL-10.
2.3. Cell Culture and Experimental Set-Up
The murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 (gift from Dr. Paul deFigueiredo, Texas A & M
University) was routinely cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. LPS (heat-killed Salmonella enterica)
was purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).
2.3.1. LPS Stimulation of Macrophages
RAW264.7 cells were seeded at a density of ~2.0 × 105 cells/well in a 96-well tissue culture plate
and allowed to attach overnight. Cells were stimulated with different concentrations (0, 0.1, 1 and
10 ȝg/mL) of LPS diluted in growth medium. Whole cells were used to measure total and

95
phosphorylated NF-țB after 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 120 and 240 min post-LPS stimulation. Culture
supernatants were collected after 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 h post-LPS stimulation to measure secreted
TNF-Į and IL-10 concentrations.
2.3.2. Transcription Factor NF-țB Quantification by ELISA
The relative concentrations of total and phosphorylated NF-țB in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7
macrophage cells were determined using a commercially-available enzyme-linked-immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
suggested protocol.
2.3.3. Cytokines TNF-Į and IL-10 Quantification by ELISA
The concentrations of de novo synthesized TNF-Į and IL-10 in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7
macrophage culture supernatant were determined by commercially available enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA), using the
manufacturer’s suggested protocol.
3. Results and Discussion
Based on published reports of LPS stimulation resulting in TNF-Į [34] and IL-10 secretion [35]
in RAW264.7 murine macrophages, as well as the established suppression of TNF-Į by IL-10 in
RAW264.7 cells [34], we developed an integrated ODE model to represent the production of TNFĮ and IL-10 in RAW264.7 cells upon LPS stimulation and their regulatory feedback loops. Eight
parameters of the model are selected for estimation using local sensitivity analysis and hierarchical
clustering (shown in Figure 4) [36,37]. The y-axis represents the parameter distance ranging from
zero to one (the larger the distance, the smaller the similarity between the parameters). The red line
presents the cutoff value, which groups the entire set of parameters into eight pairwise
indistinguishable clusters. The selected parameters, which have the largest sensitivity magnitude in
each cluster, are highlighted in red. The values of the selected parameters are estimated using the
trust-region optimization technique, as described in Materials and Methods section, and their
estimated values are listed (in bold) in Table 2. One advantage of this approach is that the selected
parameters used for estimation result in a more robust dynamic model with an accurate prediction
capability [37]. Model simulations after parameter estimation predict rapid phosphorylation of
NF-țB upon exposure to LPS, as shown in Figure 5A. The maximum fold change in the ratio of
phosphorylated NF-țB to total NF-țB in LPS-treated cells relative to control increased with
increasing LPS concentration and varied from ~2.0 at the highest LPS concentration to being
essentially unchanged at the lowest concentration (Figure 5A).

Figure 4. Representation of local sensitivity analysis results, used for selecting
parameters that are to be estimated. The y-axis represents parameter distance ranging
from zero to one. The red line represents the cutoff value, which groups the entire set of
parameters into eight pairwise indistinguishable clusters. The selected parameters from
each of the eight clusters are highlighted in red. The normalized sensitivity magnitudes
of the parameters are reflected in the histograms.
Simulation of de novo synthesized TNF-Į profile upon LPS stimulation shows that the TNF-α
concentration reaches a maximum of ~1500 pg/mL at 4 h and starts declining thereafter. Even though
LPS is continuously present, TNF-Į is undetectable at 24 h for all LPS concentrations (Figure 5B).
The maximum TNF-Į concentration at 4 h increases with increasing concentrations of LPS.
According to the model predictions, the de novo synthesized IL-10 concentration increases beyond
2 h of LPS stimulation, as shown in Figure 5C, and the concentration of IL-10 produced increases
with increasing LPS concentrations.

RAW264.7 macrophages. (A) Phosphorylated NF-țB/Total NF-țB in LPS-treated
macrophages relative to the control; (B) Profile of de novo synthesized TNF-Į (pg/mL)
upon LPS stimulation; (C) Profile of de novo synthesized IL-10 (pg/mL) upon
LPS stimulation.
Model simulations are validated by experimental data obtained from LPS-stimulated RAW264.7
cells. The comparison between simulated and experimental data for the fold change in NF-țB
(phosphorylated NF-țB/Total NF-țB, relative to control), de novo TNF-Į and IL-10 concentration
profiles after parameter estimation are shown in Figure 5A, 5B and 5C, respectively. In Figure 5A,
the discrepancy between the model simulation and experimental data for 0.1 μg/mL LPS stimulation
could arise from our assumption that the binding affinity between LPS and TLR4 is constant and
concentrations of the LPS-TLR4 complex are linearly proportional to the concentrations of LPS
tested. However, in reality, the ligand-receptor binding kinetics might follow a non-linear behavior,
which is not accommodated in our computational model. The binding of LPS to TLR4 even at lower
concentrations of LPS (e.g., 0.1 μg/mL) might result in higher concentrations of the LPS-TLR4
complex, resulting in more downstream phosphorylation of NF-țB (as indicated by the higher
phosphorylated NF-țB/total NF-țB ratio for the experimental data in Figure 5A) than the model is
able to predict. However, the dynamic model where the parameters have been estimated exhibits a
reasonably good fit for phosphorylated NF-țB/total NF-țB profiles (relative to control) at 0 ȝg/mL,
1 ȝg/mL and 10 ȝg/mL LPS stimulations. Furthermore, the model exhibits reasonable agreement

99
between simulated and experimental data for both training and validation datasets for the TNF-Į and
IL-10 dynamic concentration profiles.
The model suggests that the initial increases in TNF-Į and IL-10 are due to NF-țB activation
(i.e., phosphorylation and dissociation of NF-țB from IțBĮ-NF-țB complex) in the cytoplasm and
subsequent gene expression in the nucleus; and the decrease in TNF-Į concentration after 4 h is due
to the negative feedback of IL-10 on NF-țB activity (by inhibiting both IKK activation and nuclear
translocation of phosphorylated NF-țB). Interestingly, the levels of IL-10 continue to increase,
even when the levels of activated NF-țB are no longer increasing. It is possible that the initial burst
of IL-10 produced through NF-țB activation can activate other transcription factors, which leads to
an increase in IL-10 levels. An example of this could be the transcription factor STAT3, which has been
shown to be activated by IL-10 [38]. Endogenous IL-10 in LPS stimulation of macrophages
(RAW264.7) [39] forms the IL-10-IL10R complex that initiates phosphorylation of cytosolic STAT3,
followed by its dimerization and translocation into the nucleus. The STAT3 dimer binds to the DNA
response element and triggers transcription of IL-10 (Figure S1). Thus, increasing LPS concentration
could lead to increasing concentrations of IL-10 due to the positive feedback of IL-10 on its
own production.
It can be seen that the model predictions and experimental data are in reasonable agreement, which
demonstrates that biochemical reactions, which form the structure of the model, are physiologically
relevant and can depict the interplay between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory immune
responses to maintain equilibrium (homeostasis). Furthermore, cross-talk between positive and
negative feedback regulatory loops, incorporated in the model, is integral towards mathematically
representing biochemical and gene regulatory networks, as mentioned by Tian et al. [40]. Our model
also shows that the anti-inflammatory functions in the RAW264.7 macrophage cell line is initially
triggered by pro-inflammatory stimulation. This model structure can be extended to study other cell
types with a modification in parameter values to fit model predictions to experimental datasets for
specific cell types.
The integrated mathematical model of pro- and anti-inflammatory host immune response
discussed in this paper is a step towards assimilating our knowledge and developing a quantitative
understanding of the signal transduction pathways involved in maintaining immune homeostasis,
disruption of which can lead to inflammatory disorders. This mathematical model can be further used
to study intra- and inter-kingdom signaling, i.e., the effect of bacterial metabolites (e.g., indole)
synthesized by micro flora present in the host gastro-intestinal tract on host immune response [41].
This model can be used as the basic structure to incorporate additional transcription factors, which
will be needed to study the signaling of indole and their interactions with NF-țB.

Modeling the Dynamics of Acute Phase Protein Expression in
Human Hepatoma Cells Stimulated by IL-6
Zhaobin Xu, Jens O. M. Karlsson and Zuyi Huang
Abstract: Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a systemic inflammatory mediator that triggers the human body’s
acute phase response to trauma or inflammation. Although mathematical models for IL-6 signaling
pathways have previously been developed, reactions that describe the expression of acute phase
proteins were not included. To address this deficiency, a recent model of IL-6 signaling was
extended to predict the dynamics of acute phase protein expression in IL-6-stimulated HepG2 cells
(a human hepatoma cell line). This included reactions that describe the regulation of haptoglobin,
fibrinogen, and albumin secretion by nuclear transcription factors STAT3 dimer and C/EBPȕ. This
new extended model was validated against two different sets of experimental data. Using the
validated model, a sensitivity analysis was performed to identify seven potential drug targets to
regulate the secretion of haptoglobin, fibrinogen, and albumin. The drug-target binding kinetics for
these seven targets was then integrated with the IL-6 kinetic model to rank them based upon the
influence of their pairing with drugs on acute phase protein dynamics. It was found that gp80, JAK,
and gp130 were the three most promising drug targets and that it was possible to reduce the
therapeutic dosage by combining drugs aimed at the top three targets in a cocktail. These findings
suggest hypotheses for further experimental investigation.

1. Introduction
Interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been identified as one of the major systemic mediators that orchestrate
acute phase response (APR) in the human body, as evidenced by the fact that IL-6 can stimulate the
synthesis of most acute phase proteins in liver cells [1]. The mediation of APR by IL-6 begins with
the release of IL-6 by leukocytes at the injury site. IL-6 then translocates to the liver, via the blood
stream, where it stimulates hepatocytes and activates a cascade of intracellular signal transduction
pathways. This leads to the activation of transcription factors, such as nuclear STAT3 dimer and
C/EBPȕ. These transcription factors, in turn, regulate the expression of acute phase proteins, such
as haptoglobin, fibrinogen and albumin. The IL-6 signal transduction pathway has been extensively
studied and the two major signaling pathways have been determined to be the JAK-STAT pathway
and the MAPK-C/EBPȕ pathway [2]. Nuclear STAT3 dimer and C/EBPȕ have been identified as
the transcription factors involved in these two signaling pathways, respectively [3,4]. Mathematical
models have been developed for the JAK-STAT pathway [5] and the MAPK pathway [6–8]. Singh et al.
(2006) presented the first comprehensive mathematical model for the IL-6 signal transduction
pathway by integrating models for both the JAK-STAT and the MAPK pathways [9]. Moya et al.
(2011) further extended the model of the MAPK pathway to predict the activation dynamics of

104
transcription factor C/EBPȕ [10]. However, acute phase proteins, which represent the end products
of the IL-6 signal transduction pathway and participate in the human body’s response to trauma or
inflammation, were not included in these existing mathematical models. Ryll et al. (2011)
presented the first attempt to incorporate expression of acute phase proteins (e.g., C-reactive
protein, Į2-macroglobulin, and fibrinogen) in a model of the IL-6 signaling network [11].
However, this was a qualitative logic model in which the detailed intermediate reactions for acute
phase protein activation were neglected. To address this deficiency, the model presented by
Moya et al. (2011) [10] will be extended in this work to predict the dynamics of acute phase
protein expression in HepG2 cells. Haptoglobin, fibrinogen, and albumin were selected as the
representative acute phase proteins in this work for model development. These were chosen
because they represent both positive (i.e., haptoglobin and fibrinogen) and negative (i.e., albumin)
acute phase proteins and quantitative experimental data for the expression dynamics of these three
proteins in HepG2 cells stimulated by IL-6 were available in the literature [12].
Mathematical models have previously been developed, and used, to identify potential drug
targets to treat human diseases. For example, Araujo et al. (2005) presented a modeling approach to
study the effect of multiple drugs on EGFR signaling [13]. Yang et al. (2008) further extended
Araujo’s approach to determine multiple-target optimal intervention in the arachidonic acid metabolic
network [14]. Such model-based approaches require that equations describing the signaling kinetics
be integrated with models of target-drug binding kinetics. Since there is a lack of models of acute
phase protein expression and limited information about relevant target-drug binding kinetics in the
IL-6 pathway, model-based approaches have not previously been applied to the identification of
drug targets for regulating the dynamics of acute phase proteins stimulated by IL-6. In order to
address this, our extended IL-6 model will be used in a sensitivity analysis to identify potential
drug targets for regulating the expression dynamics of albumin, haptoglobin, and fibrinogen.
Targeting JAK kinases could be useful in the treatment of a variety of diseases, including
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [15], myeloproliferative disorders [16] and cancers [17]. The approved
pan-JAK inhibitor, tofacitinib, has undergone extensive evaluation for RA and has demonstrated
efficacy in various clinical trials, likely due to its suppression of the IL-6 and cytokine pathways [18].
Along with tofacitinib, a series of JAK inhibitors have been proposed recently using a novel fused
triazolo-pyrrolopyridine scaffold [18]. Among them is imidazo-pyrrolopyridine. Since limited
information is available for drugs that bind to targets other than JAK kinases in IL-6 signaling, this
work focuses on JAK inhibitors only. Imidazo-pyrrolopyridine is used as the model drug to
illustrate the approach developed to integrate the extended IL-6 model with target-drug binding
kinetics for studying the effectiveness of single/multiple drug treatment in regulating the secretion
of acute phase response proteins.
This paper is structured as follows: A recent model of IL-6 signaling [10] is extended, in Section 2,
to predict the dynamics of acute phase protein expression. Experimental data presented in [12] are
used to estimate the unknown model parameters, and the extended model is then validated against
independent experimental data reported by [12] and [1]. Based upon the model developed in
Section 2, sensitivity analysis is conducted, in Section 3, to identify reactions that play an important
role in the regulation of the dynamics of haptoglobin, fibrinogen, and albumin. Molecular

105
components involved in these reactions are regarded as potential drug targets. A model-based
approach for virtual drug target screening is presented in Section 4 to evaluate the influence of the
interaction between potential drugs and targets on the secretion rate of acute phase proteins.
Discussion and concluding remarks related to the obtained results are given in Sections 5 and
6 respectively.
2. Model Development for the Kinetics of Acute Phase Proteins in IL-6
Stimulated Hepatocytes
2.1. IL-6 Signal Transduction Model
The starting point for the model used in this work is the IL-6 signal transduction model
developed by one of the co-authors (ZH) as described in a previous study [10]. This model can be
represented by a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (Equation (1)):

dx
= f (x, p, u )
dt

(1)

where x is a vector of the state variables of the model, p is a vector of the parameters, and u is the
input to the system. The model consists of 68 ordinary differential equations representing the mass
balances of the individual proteins and protein complexes, 117 parameters describing reaction
constants, and one input given by the extracellular IL-6 concentration.
A simplified diagram of the proteins involved in the model is shown in Figure 1. Extracellular
cytokine IL-6 initiates the APR by attaching to its receptor at the cell membrane and forming
(IL6-gp80-gp130-JAK)2 complex. This phosphorylated dimer serves as the starting point for both
the JAK-STAT and the MAPK pathways. In the JAK-STAT signaling, the phosphorylated dimer
recruits the transcription factor STAT3, which is also tyrosine phosphorylated. The phosphorylated
STAT3 dissociates from the receptor complex (IL6-gp80-gp130-JAK)2 and undergoes
dimerization. The dimerized STAT3 complex translocates to the nucleus and functions as a
transcription factor for the expression of SOCS3, which in turn binds to the receptor gp130 and
blocks the activation of JAK, thus inhibiting both STAT3 activation and MAPK activation. In the
MAPK signaling, phosphorylated gp130 recruits SHP2 which subsequently undergoes
phosphorylation. The phosphorylated SHP2 interacts with Grb2 and SOS. The binding of Grb2 and
SOS to the receptor complex leads to the activation of RAS, which further leads to the activation of
the MAPK cascade up to transcription factor C/EBPȕ.
In this work, the model reported by [10] is extended to predict the expression dynamics of
haptoglobin, fibrinogen, and albumin in HepG2 cells stimulated by IL-6. Reactions for the
synthesis of haptoglobin, fibrinogen, and albumin are first added into Moya’s model. The unknown
parameters in the extended model are estimated from the experimental data measured in HepG2
cells under constant exposure to 2 nM IL-6 for seven days [12]. The extended model is then
validated by the two data sets: the first one is for HepG2 cells under a pulse-chase stimulation of
IL-6 [12], while the second one is for steady state values of dose-dependent secretion rates of
fibrinogen and albumin in IL-6-stimulated HepG2 cultures reported by [1].

2.2. Extended Model of Acute Phase Protein Expression Dynamics
The model reported by [10] does not include reactions for the synthesis of haptoglobin,
fibrinogen, and albumin. In this subsection, reactions describing the transcription of mRNA
encoding haptoglobin, fibrinogen, and albumin, as well as reactions responsible for the translation
and secretion of these three acute phase proteins, were added into the existing model of IL-6 signal
transduction. Nuclear STAT3 dimer and C/EBPȕ, whose activation levels can be regulated by IL-6
signaling, are the two major transcription factors for initiating the expression of acute phase proteins
in the liver. In particular, C/EBPȕ, nuclear STAT3 dimer, and C/EBPĮ are the transcription factors
regulating the transcription of haptoglobin [19], fibrinogen [20], and albumin [19,21], respectively.
The transcription factor C/EBPȕ affects the expression dynamics of albumin by inhibiting the
expression of C/EBPĮ [21], and thus C/EBPȕ indirectly down-regulates the expression of albumin.
Based on these observations, reactions shown in Equations (2) through (9) were added into the IL-6
model reported by [10] such that the secretion rates of extracellular haptoglobin, fibrinogen, and
albumin (denoted as Ex-haptoglobin, Ex-fibrinogen, and Ex-albumin, respectively) can be predicted
from the extended model.

In Equations (2)–(9), the species mRNA-haptoglobin, mRNA-fibrinogen and mRNA-albumin
refer to the mRNA encoding for the corresponding protein. Equation (2) describes the transcription
process of haptoglobin, which is regulated by C/EBPȕ [19] (the corresponding Michaelis-Menten
coefficients are Vm _ h and K m _ h ). Equation (3) lumps the translation of the haptoglobin mRNA with
the secretion process of synthesized haptoglobin. Lumping was performed to reduce the number of
unknown parameters in the model, and is justifiable since one of the two sequential processes is
rate-limiting. Thus, a mass action kinetic model with an effective rate constant kt _ h was used to
describe the lumped translation and secretion processes for haptoglobin expression. Similarly,
Equations (4) and (5) describe the transcription, translation, and secretion processes of fibrinogen.
Compared to these two positive acute phase proteins, the regulation of the expression of albumin,
given by Equations (6) to (9), is more complicated. C/EBPȕ inhibits the activation of C/EBPĮ as
given in Equation (6). This down-regulates the expression of albumin, because C/EBPĮ is required to
initiate the transcription of albumin (as shown in Equation (8)). Equation (7) describes the
degradation process of C/EBPĮ in HepG2 cells due to the cell growth, while Equation (9) represents
the lumped translation and secretion of albumin. A one-day delay has been added in the albumin
transcription process as suggested by the data presented in [12]. Figure 2 shows the schematic
diagram of the extended IL-6 signal transduction pathway.
The ordinary differential equations describing the rates of newly added components involved
in Equations (2) through (9) are developed based on mass balance, mass action kinetics and
Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The resulting seven equations, Equations (A1)–(A7) (given in the
Appendix), were integrated into our existing IL-6 model [10] to yield an extended IL-6 model with
75 ordinary differential equations and 128 parameters, to predict the secretion rates of extracellular
haptoglobin, fibrinogen, and albumin.

albumin. The two dashed lines represent the JAK-STAT and MAPK-C/EBPȕ pathways

2.3. Estimation of Unknown Parameters in the Extended Model
There are 11 unknown parameters in Equations (2) through (9). Fisher information matrixes
(FIM) were used to perform identifiability analysis. All these parameters are identifiable. An
experimental data set for HepG2 cultures under a seven-day exposure to 2 nM IL-6 [12] was used
to estimate these unknown parameters. Parameter estimation was conducted with standard
nonlinear least squares optimization routines, such as lsqnonlin, available from MATLAB (The
Math Works: Natick, MA, USA). The estimated values of the 11 unknown parameters, as well as
their bounds with a 95% confidence level, were listed in the Appendix. A comparison between the
model output and the experimental data was shown in Figure 3. In addition to performing
comparison by visual inspection, the relative errors (Err) were computed according to the
Equation (10);
Err =

ˆ
Y-Y
ˆ
Y

× 100%

(10)

where Ŷ is a vector of the experimentally measured outputs at different points in time, i.e.,
[yˆ (t1) yˆ (t2 ) " yˆ (tn )] , and Y is a vector of the outputs calculated by the model at corresponding
time points, i.e., [ y(t1)

y(t2 ) " y(tn )] . The norm is the Euclidean (Ɛ2) norm. The values of Err

for the secretion rates of haptoglobin, fibrinogen, and albumin were found to be 14.41%, 12.16%,
and 7.17%, respectively. All of relative errors were below 15%, which indicates that the prediction
was reasonably good in comparison to the magnitude of the error bars in the experimental data.

of fibrinogen; (C) the secretion rate of albumin.
2.4. Validation of the Developed Model
Validation of the developed model is a crucial step before it is used to generate potential
biological hypotheses that are used for biological experiment design. In this subsection, two
independent experimental data sets were used to verify the developed model.
2.4.1. Relaxation Kinetics of Albumin, Fibrinogen, and Haptoglobin in HepG2 Cultures under a
Pulse-Chase Stimulation of IL-6
The developed model was used to predict the dynamics of the three acute phase proteins for a
pulse-chase condition where HepG2 cultures were subjected to IL-6 stimulation for three days and
thereafter maintained without IL-6 stimulation [12]. Figure 4 showed the comparison between the
model prediction and the experimental data. The values of Err for the prediction of secretion rates
of haptoglobin, fibrinogen, and albumin were 14.78%, 31.09%, and 5.15%, respectively. It can be
seen from Figure 4A that the model predicted the relaxation kinetics of haptoglobin well. A large
value of Err existed in the prediction of relaxation kinetics of fibrinogen. This is mainly due to the
mismatch between the model prediction and experimental data in Day two described in Figure 4B,
for which the error bar, i.e., the variability of experimental measurements, was quite large.
Corresponding explanation for this large error bar has been given in the original report by [12].
Other than Day two, the model prediction for fibrinogen secretion rate matched the experimental
data well. The predicted albumin secretion kinetics agreed well with the experimental data, as shown

2.4.2. Steady State Values of Dose-Dependent Secretion Rates of Fibrinogen and Albumin in IL-6
Stimulated HepG2 Cultures
In this subsection, the data published in [1], which includes the steady state secretion rates of
fibrinogen and albumin obtained in human primary hepatocytes under the exposure to IL-6 of
various concentrations, was used to further validate the extended model. Accordingly, different
concentrations of IL-6 were used in this work as the inputs for the developed model, and the steady
state values of the secretion rates of fibrinogen, albumin and haptoglobin were recorded,
normalized by the secretion rates of these three proteins for the control condition, and plotted in
Figure 5. Figure 5A showed that the steady state value of the secretion rate of fibrinogen increased
with increasing IL-6 concentrations and leveled off afterwards, following a sigmoidal profile with a
transition width corresponding to two orders of magnitude variation in the IL-6 concentration. In
addition, the maximum steady-state secretion rate was approximately four-fold higher than for the
control condition. Both of these predictions (magnitude and width of profile) were consistent with
the corresponding characteristics of the dose-dependence profile reported by [1] for fibrinogen

111
secretion. Figure 5B showed that the predicted steady-state albumin secretion rate decreased
approximately two-fold as the IL-6 concentration increased. The experimental dose response data,
measured by [1] for albumin secretion, exhibited an inhibition of similar magnitude (~2.5-fold).
However, the width of the transition in the predicted dose response for albumin was narrower than
the transition width reported by [1] for this negative acute phase protein. As seen in Figure 5C, the
steady-state haptoglobin secretion rates for various IL-6 concentrations followed a similar trend as
shown in Figure 5A for steady-state fibrinogen secretion rates, but with a narrower transition width
and a higher enhancement in the maximum steady-state secretion rate (around 5 times of the
secretion rate for the control condition). Although Heinrich et al. [1] did not report the steady-state
secretion rates of haptoglobin as a function of IL-6 concentration, the result shown in Figure 5C
was generally consistent with the response expected for a positive acute phase. One interesting
observation that was made in Figure 5 was that the ED50 value for the fibrinogen dose-dependence
profile (ED50 = 0.74 nM) was approximately double the corresponding value for the albumin dose
response curve (ED50 = 0.32 nM). This result was consistent with the relationship between the ED50
values that was observed by [1] for fibrinogen and albumin secretion. Given that measurements by [1]
represent an independent data set that was not used for parameter estimation, the agreement
between model predictions and the published dose response curves provided additional validation
of the model.

3. Investigation of Influence from the Reactions in IL-6 Signaling on the Expression
Dynamics of Haptoglobin, Fibrinogen, and Albumin
In this section, sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify the reactions in the IL-6 signaling
pathways that play an important role in the regulation of the expression dynamics of haptoglobin,
fibrinogen, and albumin. Molecular components involved in these reactions were regarded as
potential drug targets that will be further screened in Section 4.
The sensitivity analysis followed the approach of [22], in which parameters were varied by one
order of magnitude above and below their nominal values. A sensitivity metric, si,j, was then
quantified by Equation (11), in which the partial derivative of the output yj with respect to
parameter pi (i.e., a reaction rate constant) was normalized by the nominal values of pi and yj (i.e., pi0
and y 0j respectively);
si , j =

pi0∂y j
y 0j ∂pi

|P0

(11)

where the vector P0 is a vector of nominal values of all parameters in the model. In this work, the
output of the system, i.e., yj in Equation (11), was set to the seven-day mean value of the secretion
rate of haptoglobin, fibrinogen, and albumin, respectively for j equal to 1, 2, and 3.
To identify the most important parameters for modeling the expression dynamics of each acute
phase protein, the absolute value of si,j was ranked in a decreasing order (listed in Table 1, only the
top 20 parameters are listed).
As shown in Table 1, the parameters with the highest sensitivity measure values were primarily
associated with those newly added reaction equations given by Equations (2) through (9) that
described transcription, translation and secretion of haptoglobin, fibrinogen, and albumin, which
was expected. The purpose for conducting sensitivity analysis, however, was to determine the
effect of reactions from the original IL-6 signaling pathway on regulation of the expression of acute
phase proteins. This information might reveal new mechanisms that can be used to manipulate the
expression dynamics of acute phase proteins. In order to identify the reactions in IL-6 signal
transduction that play an important role in regulation of the secretion rates of haptoglobin,
fibrinogen, and albumin, the parameters shown in Table 1 were overlaid onto IL-6 signaling
reaction networks in Figure 6. As seen from Table 1, most parameters that had an important impact
on the secretion rate of haptoglobin also played an important role in regulating the secretion rate of
albumin. This can be explained by the fact that the expression of both haptoglobin and albumin was
regulated by MAPK-C/EBPȕ signaling pathway. Reactions that were essential for the regulation of
the expression of both haptoglobin and albumin constituted one group in Figure 6 (marked in blue
pentagons), while the key reactions for regulating the expression of fibrinogen were associated with
JAK-STAT pathway (marked in red ellipses in Figure 6). In addition, three reactions were
identified from Table 1 for their important role in the regulation of expression dynamics of all three
acute phase proteins. They were associated with the binding of IL-6 to its receptor and the formation
of the receptor complex. These reactions initiated both the JAK-STAT and MAPK-C/EBPȕ
pathways. They were marked in purple squares in Figure 6.

Figure 6 showed that reactions which influenced the regulation of fibrinogen secretion rate
were mainly involved in the binding of extracellular IL-6 to its receptor on the cell membrane, the
activation of STAT3C, and the expression of SOCS3. On the other hand, reactions that were related
to the activation and deactivation regulation of Raf*, the activation of MEK, ERK-PP, and nuclear
C/EBPȕ were important to the expression of both haptoglobin and albumin.
The information in Figure 6 was used to select putative drug targets for further evaluation. In
this work, good drug targets were regarded as those participating in reactions that affect the
regulation of all three acute phase proteins. In addition, they should be in monomer form, as the
monomer was the basic unit to form a complex [23]. Components with non-zero initial
concentrations were also given priority, as they represented existing targets that the drug can bind
to. Based upon these criteria, seven drug targets were selected from those important reactions as
shown in Figure 6 (specifically; gp80, JAK, gp130, STAT3C, Raf, MEK, and C/EBPȕi).
Components gp80, JAK, gp130 were selected as they construct the receptor complex 
ሺ ͸ െ ͺͲ െ ͳ͵Ͳ െ ሻ‫כ‬ଶ which was involved in several important reactions. The other four
drug targets were either directly involved or phosphorylated in those important reactions. These
seven drug targets were further evaluated in Section 4 based upon the efficacy of the interaction with
their drug counterparts on regulating the dynamics of acute phase proteins.

4. Virtual Screening of Drug Targets and Drugs for Acute Phase Response
A good drug target should have high feasibility of binding a drug, that is, it should require low
binding energy. On the other hand, the binding of a drug to a good target should cause a large
influence on the dynamics of acute phase proteins. A model-based platform was developed in this
section to incorporate the drug and target interaction in the extended IL-6 model to screen the seven
drug targets selected in Section 3. The influence from drug binding kinetics was then investigated
on the basis of the developed platform, which was followed by evaluating the treatment strategy of
multiple drugs against multiple targets.

4.1. A Model-Based Platform to Study the Influence from the Drug (Imidazo-Pyrrolopyridine) on
Acute Phase Protein Secretion
In this work, Equation (12) was used to describe the interaction of drug and its corresponding
receptor. The competitive inhibition kinetics instead of more complicated inhibition kinetics (e.g.,
non-competitive binding) was preferred here to elucidate the developed approach, which can be
revised and extended for other inhibition kinetics.

(12)

In Equation (12) Ki was the equilibrium constant, kf was the forward rate constant, and kf/Ki was
the backward rate constant. The value of Ki for a drug-target pair can be obtained from experiment
or computational interpretation [24]. In order to quantify the influence from the drug on the
signaling pathway and thus the system output, differential equations for the drug and the drug-target
complex were added into the ODE model. The differential equation for the receptor was modified
accordingly. Among the seven drug targets identified from Section 3, JAK had been extensively
studied for its interaction with existing drugs. Therefore, JAK and its drug counterpart imidazopyrrolopyridine were used as the example to illustrate our approach in this section. The
corresponding value of Ki was determined to be 2.5 nMí1 from experiment [18]. Since no
information was found for kf in the literature, a value of 0.01 nMí1·sí1 was assigned to kf to study
the dynamics of the three acute phase proteins upon the treatment with various doses of
imidazo-pyrrolopyridine in Figure 7. The value of 0.01 nMí1·síM was selected for kf here because a
larger value didn’t further change the expression dynamics of the three acute phase proteins in
the simulation.
Since the EC50 of imidazo-pyrrolopyridine was 180 nM [18], the concentration of
imidazo-pyrrolopyridine was increased from 0 to 240 nM in intervals of 60 nM, as shown in Figure
7. It can be seen that imidazo-pyrrolopyridine was predicted to greatly inhibit the secretion of
fibrinogen, slightly inhibited the production of haptoglobin, and slightly promoted the secretion of
albumin. The overall effect of this drug was to attenuate acute phase response, which was
characterized by the decrease in the concentration of positive acute phase proteins (i.e., fibrinogen
and haptoglobin) but increase in the level of negative acute phase proteins (i.e., albumin). In
addition, the dose of imidazo-pyrrolopyridine had a significant influence on the production of
fibrinogen especially, as a low dose (even lower than 60 nM) was able to repress most of the
fibrinogen secretion. On the other hand, the production of hatoglobin and albumin did not change
as much upon increasing the dose of imidazo-pyrrolopyridine, until a relatively high drug dose
was applied.
The parameter kf reflected the speed of the drug binding reaction. Figure 8 showed the kinetics
of fibrinogen expression for four values of kf, as no experimental data were found for the kf value.
Since imidazo-pyrrolopyridine had a large influence on the secretion of fibrinogen, only the result
for fibrinogen was shown here to save space. It seems that a small increase in kf value from zero
was able to suppress the secretion of fibrinogen significantly. When kf increased to 0.01 nMí1·sí1,
the binding of imidazo-pyrrolopyridine to JAK reached its saturated speed.

4.2. Ranking Drug Targets Based upon the Influence from Their Interaction with the Drug on the
Dynamics of Acute Phase Proteins
In this section, we further ranked the seven potential drug targets identified from Section 3 on
the basis of the interaction between each drug and its target. For the same drug dose, the best drug

117
& target pair should return the highest effectiveness in regulating the dynamics of acute phase
proteins. It was fortunate that the binding kinetics for the pair of imidazo-pyrrolopyridine and JAK
was found in the literature (i.e., the Ki value shown in Section 4.1). However, no binding kinetic
data were found for the other six drug targets identified in Section 3, although data might exist in
commercial database from pharmaceutical companies (which was not accessible by public). Since
the value of Ki for the other six drug targets was not available in literature, it was assumed in this
section that these targets were bound by the drug with the same kinetics as the one for imidazopyrrolopyridine and JAK. Based upon this, simulations were performed to evaluate the
effectiveness of each drug-target pair on regulating the secretion rates of the three acute phase
proteins. The effectiveness was quantified by the maximum percentage change in the secretion rate
of each acute phase protein upon the binding of the drug to each target (Figure 9). The values of Ki
and kf were kept the same as those used in Section 4.1. The drug dose was set to 60 nM because the
simulation result in Figure 7 implies that was a high enough concentration to suppress the
fibrinogen secretion. The binding of the drug to each of gp80, JAK, and gp130 reduced the
secretion rates of fibrinogen (by 74.4%, 71.0%, and 71.8%) and haptoglobin
(by 44.5%, 4.2%, and 5.3%) but enhanced the production rate of albumin (by 22.9%, 1.7%, and
2.2%). The interaction from these drug-target pairs generally inhibited the acute phase response,
especially in suppressing the secretion of fibrinogen. This can be explained by the fact that these three
receptors played an important role in initiating both JAK-STAT and MAPK-C/EBPȕ pathways. The
binding of a drug to STATC inhibited the expression of fibrinogen (by 2.6%), slightly enhanced the
section of haptoglobin (by 0.01%), and barely reduced the expression of albumin (by 0.006%). This
made sense, as inhibition of STAT3C prevented the activation of nuclear STAT3 dimer and thus
down-regulated the expression of fibrinogen. The deactivation of JAK-STAT pathway released some
ሺ ͸ െ ͺͲ െ ͳ͵Ͳ െ ሻ‫כ‬ଶ complex to MAPK-C/EBPȕ pathway for enhancing the production
of haptoglobin. Therefore, the drug-STAT3C interaction only partially suppressed the acute phase
response. The binding of the drug to Raf and C/EBPȕi enhanced the secretion rate of albumin (by
0.08% and 54.2%), but reduced the secretion rate of haptoglobin (by 0.5% and 72.6%). Since Raf
and C/EBPȕi were the upstream components for the activation of nuclear C/EBPȕ, inhibition of
these two components by drugs down-regulated haptoglobin expression and restored albumin
activation. The drugs binding to either Raf or C/EBPȕi only partially inhibited the acute phase
response, as the secretion of fibrinogen was enhanced by 0.2% and 0.001% upon the drug binding.
The drug-MEK pair showed similar effect on acute phase response as the drug-Raf or drugC/EBPȕi pair, however, the effect from the drug-MEK pair was very limited (less than 0.001%).
One potential reason for this was that the initial concentration of MEK (i.e., 41,667 nM)
overwhelmed the drug dose (i.e., 60 nM) in this simulation.
Based upon the simulation result shown in Figure 9, components gp80, gp130, and JAK were
ranked as the top three drug targets because: (1) they had a noticeable effect on the secretion rates
of all three acute phase proteins; and (2) they counteracted the acute phase response, while the
others only partially do so. While it was assumed that the same Ki was used for all the drugs in this
study for screening drug targets, this assumption can be relaxed if kinetic data are available in
the future.

the binding of a drug with the concentration of 60 nM to each of the selected seven
drug targets.
4.3. Influence of Multiple Drug Treatment on Acute Phase Protein Secretion
Only single drug-target pair was studied in Sections 4.1 and 4.2. We further applied the
developed platform to quantify the effectiveness of a cocktail of drugs in regulating the dynamics
of acute phase proteins. Since gp80, JAK, and gp130 were identified as good drug targets for
regulating acute phase proteins, they constructed the drug target pool in this study. Similar to
Section 4.2, a drug with similar binding kinetics was assumed for each of these three targets, and
the corresponding drug and target binding reactions (e.g., Equation (12)) were added into the
extended IL-6 ODE model. The production rate of fibrinogen for the cell treated with single drug
that binds to gp80, JAK, and gp130 respectively was compared to the fibrinogen production rate in
the cell treated with the three drugs that aim at gp80, JAK, and gp130 respectively in Figure 10. A
low dose (i.e., 10 nM), was used here for each drug in all these scenarios to prove that the same
effectiveness could be obtained using low doses of drugs if multiple drugs were applied to multiple
drug targets. As shown in Figure 10, treating the cell with multiple drugs against multiple targets
was able to enhance the inhibition of fibrinogen accumulation (see the black curve in Figure 10).
Compared to the effectiveness shown in Figure 7B where 60 nM imidazo-pyrrolopyridine was
applied to its target (i.e., JAK), the cocktail with three drugs returned a better performance in
suppressing the secretion of fibrinogen even with a lower dose (i.e., 10 nM).
In case that 60 nM imidazo-pyrrolopyridine might cause side effect, it was possible to get the same
inhibition effectiveness by reducing its dose by adding the drugs aimed at gp80 and gp130.
The developed platform can thus be used as a tool to optimize the drug cocktail if the kinetic data
and side effect information are available for drug candidates, and to provide a new strategy in
future drug design for acute phase response.

and gp130 bound by a single drug (10 nM) and in the cell with all gp80, JAK, gp130

5. Discussion
This work presents the first comprehensive mathematical model for quantifying the kinetics of
acute phase protein expression in the acute phase response mediated by IL-6. In addition to IL-6, it
is possible for acute phase protein expression to be regulated by other cytokines, such as IL-1,
TNF-Į, IL-11, and OSM (oncostatin M) [25]. Although adding the signaling pathways associated
with these cytokines can provide a more comprehensive model of the acute phase response, it
would be a challenging task currently due to the following two reasons: (1) not all the reactions and
pathways that connect these cytokines to acute phase proteins are known; (2) limited quantitative
data are available for acute phase protein expression in cells stimulated by these cytokines.
Therefore, we have focused on the IL-6 signaling pathway in this work. The extended IL-6 model
will serve as a good starting point for incorporating other signaling pathways in the future, if
quantitative data become available for acute phase protein expression following stimulation by
other cytokines.
The presented IL-6 model was validated by two independent datasets that included
measurements of three representative acute phase proteins for various stimulation patterns of IL-6.
In addition, the dynamics of these three acute phase proteins were predicted for hepatic cells treated
by single or multiple drugs. Although extensive literature review has been conducted, limited
quantitative data were found to validate the predicted effects of drug treatment. Experimental
research is therefore needed to further quantify the dynamics of acute phase proteins in hepatocyte
cells treated with drugs targeting gp80, gp130, and JAK. Despite of this, the model is able to
provide a general direction for drug target selection. For example, the model can rank potential
drug targets based upon the predicted effect of the binding of a drug to each of these targets (as
shown in Figure 9). With the same binding kinetics assumed for all target-drug pairs, the
simulation result could reveal which drug targets, upon the competitive inhibition, have a relatively
large influence on the kinetics of acute phase proteins. Since no binding affinity information is
available and thus incorporated in the model, the ranking of drug targets may not completely

120
accurate. However, the model dose provides a platform to qualitatively compare those potential
drug targets. In addition, the model can be used to predict the dose response for each drug target (as
shown in Figure 7 for JAK), which provides information on the sensitivity of a drug target to the
drug dose. This provides additional information for drug target screening and drug dosage
selection. Furthermore, the model is able to predict the effect of the drug on the kinetics of the
molecules other than the three acute phase proteins. This may be helpful to quantify the side effect
of the drug.
JAK, gp80, gp130 were predicted to be the three optimal drug targets for regulating the
dynamics of the acute phase proteins (i.e., fibrinogen, haptoglobin, and albumin) investigated in
this work. Since these three macromolecules have distinct binding sites, they can be considered as
separate drug targets. Seven potential drug targets were ranked according to the influence of their
interaction with drugs on the dynamics of all three acute phase proteins. In the extended IL-6
model, fibrinogen is mainly regulated by the JAK-STAT pathway while albumin and haptoglobin
are associated with the MAPK pathway. Because JAK, gp80, and gp130 are involved in reactions
for activating both the JAK-STAT and MAPK pathways, they were found to be better intervention
points than the other four drug targets. If we aim to regulate only one or two acute phase proteins,
other drug target may be better than JAK, gp80, and gp130. For example, C/EBPȕi is a better drug
target than JAK, gp80, and gp130 for regulating the dynamics of albumin (see Figure 9).
6. Conclusions
This work developed the first comprehensive IL-6 model that can predict the expression
dynamics of haptoglobin, fibrinogen, and albumin in HepG2 cultures stimulated by IL-6. The
developed model was validated by two different sets of experimental data, and the relative errors of
the model predictions for most cases were at, or below, 15%. Based on the developed model,
sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify potential drug targets for regulating acute phase
protein dynamics, which included gp80, JAK, gp130, STAT3C, Raf, MEK, and C/EBPȕi.
Imidazo-pyrrolopyridine targeted at JAK was used as an example drug to illustrate an approach in
which the drug-target interaction is integrated with kinetic models to study the drug dose response.
The simulation result showed that imidazo-pyrrolopyridine inhibited the acute phase response,
especially the secretion of fibrinogen. The developed approach was used to further rank seven drug
targets, with the assumption that each of them was targeted by a drug with similar binding kinetics.
This assumption can be removed in the future when drug binding kinetic data are available for all
drug targets. Upon binding to the drug, the targets gp80, JAK, and gp130 were found to have the
largest effect on regulating the secretion of fibrinogen and on attenuating acute phase response. The
developed platform was then applied to investigate the effectiveness of the drugs that bind to these
three most effective targets on the regulation of fibrinogen. The simulation results show that the
multiple-drug treatment approach can reduce the drug dosage to obtain the same treatment
effectiveness when compared to single drug treatment approaches.

A Computational Study of the Effects of Syk Activity on B Cell
Receptor Signaling Dynamics
Reginald L. McGee, Mariya O. Krisenko, Robert L. Geahlen, Ann E. Rundell and
Gregery T. Buzzard
Abstract: The kinase Syk is intricately involved in early signaling events in B cells and is
required for proper response when antigens bind to B cell receptors (BCRs). Experiments using an
analog-sensitive version of Syk (Syk-AQL) have better elucidated its role, but have not completely
characterized its behavior. We present a computational model for BCR signaling, using dynamical
systems, which incorporates both wild-type Syk and Syk-AQL. Following the use of sensitivity
analysis to identify signiﬁcant reaction parameters, we screen for parameter vectors that produced
graded responses to BCR stimulation as is observed experimentally. We demonstrate qualitative
agreement between the model and dose response data for both mutant and wild-type kinases.
Analysis of our model suggests that the level of NF-κB activation, which is reduced in Syk-AQL
cells relative to wild-type, is more sensitive to small reductions in kinase activity than Erkp activation,
which is essentially unchanged. Since this proﬁle of high Erkp and reduced NF-κB is consistent with
anergy, this implies that anergy is particularly sensitive to small changes in catalytic activity. Also,
under a range of forward and reverse ligand binding rates, our model of Erkp and NF-κB activation
displays a dependence on a power law afﬁnity: the ratio of the forward rate to a non-unit power of
the reverse rate. This dependence implies that B cells may respond to certain details of binding and
unbinding rates for ligands rather than simple afﬁnity alone.

1. Introduction
Signaling through the B cell receptor (BCR) involves an intricate network of molecular reactions
necessary for B cells to generate an immune response. The signaling network involves a variety of
proteins including kinases and phosphatases and is particularly dependent on the protein-tyrosine
kinase (PTK) Syk. To better understand the network, it is imperative to examine the roles of
key signaling components like Syk and their most inﬂuential interactions. We will employ a
computational approach to quantify the impact of Syk and other key enzymes and factors such as
the effect of the amount of antigen on the B cell response.
Catalytically active Syk has been shown experimentally to play a central role in BCR signaling,
but questions regarding its behavior still exist and the time frames in which critical interactions must
occur have yet to be completely characterized. Experimentally, a mutated version of Syk called
analog-sensitive Syk or Syk-AQL has been engineered to accept orthogonal inhibitors, i.e., inhibitors
that have been synthesized to render the mutant kinase inactive almost immediately [1]. Furthermore,

125
by replacing wild-type Syk with Syk-AQL creates B cells whose signaling capacity can be reduced
or interrupted completely by the addition of the orthogonal inhibitor, experimentalists could then
control the time that Syk remains active following receptor engagement, which helped to conﬁrm
how BCR signaling is modulated by the actions of Syk. Recently, a Syk-deﬁcient B cell line was
generated in which Syk-AQL expression can be induced in response to the drug tetracycline. Thus,
in addition to being able to turn Syk off when desired, its expression level before activation can be
adjusted if needed.
Computational modeling allows us to gain insight into Syk’s impact that was not previously
possible with experimentation alone. We have developed a model built on a T cell receptor
(TCR) signaling model originally created by Zheng et al. [2] and later expanded and used by
Perley et al. [3] for cellular level control. Perley’s success in using Zheng’s model for prediction
and open-loop control made it an ideal candidate to adapt for our B cell study. The signaling of
B cell and of T cell can be divided into early interactions, which occur proximal to the membrane,
and downstream interactions, which occur in the cytoplasm and ultimately lead to the nucleus. The
dynamics of the downstream signaling are nearly identical between the cells, and thus this part of the
Zheng model remained largely unchanged. The signaling dynamics of T cell and of B cell differ the
most in their early signaling, which is where most model revisions were required.
In the past decade there have been a number of computational models, both stochastic and
deterministic varieties, focusing on various aspects of B cell signaling, but none have considered
impairment to Syk and the resulting effect on cell response. Stochastic simulations have been
used by Tsourkas et al. [4] and Mukherjee et al. [5] while considering spatial dynamics of BCR
signaling. The impact of afﬁnity discrimination was considered by Tsourkas in their study, while
Mukherjee investigated the roles of Syk and Lyn in immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif
(ITAM) phosphorylation. A deterministic model by Chaudhri et al. [6] considers a scope similar
to Zheng’s T cell model, with the model covering both membrane proximal, early signaling events
and downstream signaling events. This model pays particular interest to the role of phosphatases in
the signal transduction. In 2012, Barua et al. [7] developed a deterministic model of B cell early
signaling in order to study the feedback loops involving Lyn and how varying stimulation to the BCR
leads to a range of dynamics in Syk. Impressively, the model incorporates every phosphorylation
event for all six signaling components considered.
Our model is novel in its incorporation of Syk-AQL dynamics and given its scope, the inclusion
of both early and downstream signaling, this allows us to investigate the impact of Syk modulation
on a large number of signaling components. Instead of considering all possible phosphorylations for
our 32 signaling components, our model considers only the most critical events in order to represent
relevant physiological behavior and minimize model complexity. Understanding the means by which
cell responses are determined is also of particular interest and the model will allow us to investigate
the impact of both the amount of antigen and the level of Syk activity on the response. In this initial
study we are particularly interested in the regulation of Erk and NF-κB activity since both contribute
to determining cell fate.

126
We will study how Erk and NF-κB phosphorylation change with modulation of receptor afﬁnity.
Using parameter values derived largely by ﬁtting the Perley model [3] to T cell data as nominal
points, we use B cell data from Healy et al. [8] to then determine points in parameter space that
allow us to reproduce data from cellular assays. Then, using the difference of Erkp, the sum of singly
and doubly phosphorylated Erk, and NF-κB as our metrics, we consider how cell response changes
with receptor characteristics in both wild-type and mutant cells.
One interesting prediction of our model is that activation of Erkp and NF-κB depend on ligand
binding rates in a way that is nearly independent of the reverse rate for low values of the reverse rate
and in a way that depends on a ﬁxed ratio of powers of forward and reverse binding rates for higher
values of the reverse binding rate. This is illustrated and discussed in Section 4.3 and is one indication
that afﬁnity (the ratio of forward and reverse binding rates) alone is not sufﬁcient to characterize the
response of a B cell to a given antibody.
The cell line used and experimental procedures are described in the experimental section. In the
model section, we describe model construction and explicitly show equations and a diagram for the
signaling dynamics. In the methods section, we discuss the sensitivity analysis used and criteria used
to screen the parameter space. The discussion section includes biological background for the model
and ﬁndings of the sensitivity analysis, parameter screening, and contour analysis. We also present
a comparison of our model output with a dataset from Chaudhri et al. [6], and ﬁnish with some
discussion of future direction and limitations.
2. Model Development
2.1. Biological Background
Since our B cell model is derived from an existing T cell model, we note here some of the primary
components of B cell signaling, with a focus on aspects that are unique to B cells. Conventional T
cells bind peptide antigens presented by major histocompatibility molecules whereas B cells can
bind multiple molecular species through polymorphic cell surface immunoglobulins that serve as
antigen receptors. The B cells work collaboratively with T cells to respond to monomeric antigens
or independently of T cells to respond to polymeric antigens that cluster the BCR.
Once an antigen is bound and the BCR is aggregated, the signaling mechanisms at the B cell
membrane are activated and an intricate system of molecular interactions initiates [9]. There are
many kinases involved in this process; two connected with events proximal to the receptor in B cells
are the Src-family PTK Lyn and the PTK Syk [10]. Syk plays a central role in the overall response of
a B cell [11]. Unlike signaling in T cells, which depends on the Src-family PTK Lck to phosphorylate
the ﬁrst tyrosine of the ITAM of the TCR, the ﬁrst ITAM tyrosine in B cells can be phosphorylated by
Syk when Lyn, which is homologous to Lck in T cells, is not present [12]. Furthermore, if Syk is not
expressed, BCR signaling cannot proceed. Following the initiation of BCR signaling, the regulation
of BCR, Syk, and Lyn activity is orchestrated by feedback loops involving the aforementioned PTKs
and a collection of regulatory enzymes.

127
The regulatory enzymes considered are the tyrosine-phosphatase SHP1, the C-terminal Src kinase
Csk and its binding protein Cbp, and the phosphatase CD45 [13,14]. In addition to regulating fully
activated Lyn along with CD45, SHP1 also dephosphorylates the ITAMs of the BCR and tyrosines
Y342 and Y346 of Syk, thus reducing their activity. Note that SHP1 does not complete these actions
until it has been activated itself by a Lyn, which has been dephosphorylated at its inhibitory site by
CD45. After binding with a phosphorylated Cbp, activated Csk counteracts the dephosphorylation of
Lyn promoted by CD45. The phosphorylation of Cbp is also promoted by CD45 activity. Gaining a
better grasp of the timing of the interplay in these feedback loops is an important task as it provides
insight into exactly how the BCR and primary PTKs are regulated and thus illuminates the overall
sequence of events for signal transduction.
Once active, Syk phosphorylates several substrates and the resulting signals propagate into several
downstream pathways that lead to the activation of downstream targets such as Erk, NFAT, and
NF-κB [9–11]. Following the translocation of these molecules into the nucleus, transcription begins
and cell fate activation (proliferation), apoptosis (cell death), or anergy (chronic unresponsiveness)
are determined. Interestingly, these cell responses have been found by Healy et al. [8] to correspond
to characteristic combinations of the aforementioned targets. For example, anergic B cells exhibit
signaling activity in the Erk and NFAT pathways, but not in the NF-κB pathway [8]. Again, Erk and
NF-κB are of particular interest in this study due to their role in cell fate determination. The afﬁnity
is a measure of how tightly a ligand binds to a receptor.
of a receptor for an antibody Kafﬁnity = kkforward
reverse
However, for a given afﬁnity, larger forward and reverse rates can allow the ligand to bind and unbind
repeatedly and rapidly. Allowing this association and disassociation with the receptor to occur over
prolonged periods of times and in the proper concentrations could be sufﬁcient to simulate the low,
chronic exposure of the BCR to antigen, which has been seen to induce anergy [15]. The causes
for anergy have not been completely characterized, and we hope to use the model to gain a better
understanding of the molecular triggers leading to anergy and the associated nonresponsiveness of
B cells.
2.2. Model
The model we present was developed based on the deterministic model for the TCR MAPK
pathway created by Zheng [2] and extended by Perley [3]. Due to similarities in the signaling
network, much of the model structure for the medial and downstream pathways required little
modiﬁcation. In particular, the model structure and equations for the MAPK pathway, which contains
Erk, and the NF-κB pathway, are analogous to those found in [16]. A diagram focusing on the
signaling dynamics for our system is shown in Figure 1.

128
Figure 1. A depiction of the early, medial, and downstream signaling events induced by
binding between B cell receptor and ligand, as described in the biological background
section. Jagged arrows denote stimulations, curved arrows denote binding, straight
arrows denote conversions, and color denotes species to appear repeatedly in the diagram.
The plus and minus marks near the IκB-NF-κB disassociation reaction indicate which are
positive feedbacks and which are negative feedbacks.

The model tracks the concentrations of 22 distinct species with the different forms of these species
represented by individual variables. The model equations were formulated with mass action kinetics;
conservation laws were used to reduce the number of variables in the system. The resulting model

129
consists of 32 ordinary differential equations and has 114 parameters. Based on a sensitivity analysis
described in the methods section, there are 12 kinetic parameters whose impact we will investigate
in this study. Another important parameter is the ligand concentration, which is an external input
to the model. We present equations for the revised early signaling dynamics only and refer to [3]
for the remaining equations. We assume that there is no downstream activity prior to receptor
stimulation; hence, our model is structured to be at zero at steady state for downstream variables like
Erkp and NF-κB. Additionally, we do not have any feedback between our downstream and upstream
components, so setting these variables to zero is more of a baseline value than an absolute value.
2.3. Model Equations
BCR Activation: The receptor dynamics considered here include engagement of the BCR, ITAM
tyrosine phosphorylation, Syk binding to the BCR, and BCR internalization, recycling and
degradation. The key variables include free BCR xBCRf ree , BCR bound by ligand xBCRb ,
singly-phosphorylated BCR xBCRp1 , and doubly-phosphorylated BCR xBCRp2 . The model
formulation reﬂects how the kinase Syk can bind to either form of the phosphorylated BCR. Due
to the positive promotion of ITAM tyrosine phosphorylation by membrane proximal PTKs [11],
we assume that if Syk binds to a singly-phosphorylated BCR, that receptor will become
doubly-phosphorylated before the kinase can unbind. Thus there is no term for unbinding from Sykb
to BCRp1 in any of the model equations. Receptor internalization xBCRi is promoted by clathrin,
which is localized xClathrinlocal to the membrane by Syk.

Syk Activation: We consider four forms of Syk, three of which have been modiﬁed
through binding or phosphorylation. The variable xSyk represents the amount of kinase that
has not been activated and is unbound. The variable xSykb is the basally active form of
the kinase that has been bound to the BCR. The catalytically active form of Syk that has
been phosphorylated at tyrosine Y342 and Y346 is denoted by xSyk342 and is responsible for
enhancing signaling propagation. If either active form of the kinase becomes phosphorylated
at tyrosine Y317 it is rendered inactive. This inactive form is denoted by xSyk317 . The
forms represented by xSyk342 and xSyk317 are still assumed to be bound to the BCR.
As discussed below, each of these four forms of Syk can bind to an orthogonal inhibitor; this binding
also renders Syk inactive.

Syk-AQL dynamics: As discussed in the Introduction, Syk-AQL allows for Syk activity to be
modulated through the addition of the orthogonal inhibitor (OI). The binding of the OI to the mutant
Syk-AQL is also modeled using mass action kinetics and can be seen in Figure 2.
Figure 2. Orthogonal Inhibitor (OI) binding kinetics. Sykj denotes any of the modeled
forms of Syk.

This binding results in the term rInhibitor association · [OI] · xSykj where j denotes any one of
the forms of Syk modeled. These terms are subtracted from each of the equations for their
respective forms of Syk. By conservation of mass, we have the following equation for orthogonally
inhibited Syk:

+ rInhibitor association · [OI] · xSyk317 + rInhibitor association · [OI] · xf reeSyk .
Lyn Activation: For the Src-family PTK Lyn (xLyn ) to become fully activated (xLyn∗ ), it must
be dephosphorylated at Y508 (xLyndp ) and then go through an autophosphorylation reaction. We
consider both events with the following equations:
dxLyndp
= [Lyn dephosphorylation] − [Lyn phosphorylation]...
dt
+ [Lyn de-autophosphorylation] − [Lyn autophosphorylation]
= rLyn dephosphorylation xCD45 xLyn − rLyn phosphorylation xCsk∗ xLyndp ...

− (rLyn de−autophosphorylation1 · xCD45 + rLyn de−autophosphorylation2 · xSHP 1∗ )xLyn∗ ...
− rLyn de−autophosphorylation by phosphatases · xLyn∗
Regulatory Enzyme Dynamics: Following the initiation of BCR signaling, the regulation of
BCR, Syk, and Lyn activity is orchestrated by feedback loops involving the aforementioned PTKs
and a collection of regulatory enzymes. The dynamic members of the regulatory subsystem are
SHP1, Csk and Cbp, with their dynamics being driven by the amount of CD45. The activated forms
of SHP1, Csk and Cbp are denoted by the variables xSHP 1∗ , xCsk∗ and xCbpp∗ , respectively, and are
modeled with the following equations:
dxSHP 1∗
= [SHP1 activation] − [SHP1 inactivation]

dxCbpp∗

dt
= rCbp phosphorylation · xLyndp xCbp − rCbp dephosphorylation · xCD45 xCbpp
Medial Signaling Dynamics (BLNK, BTK, PLC2γ): The second messenger PLC2γ is critical
for transducing a signal downstream following Syk activation. Before becoming fully activated,
PLC2γ must bind to the linker protein BLNK and be phosphorylated by Syk and the Bruton’s tyrosine
kinase (BTK). Here BTK must also bind to BLNK, and it is phosphorylated by Syk and Lyn before
it becomes fully activated. These events are modeled by the following equations:

3. Materials and Methods
In this section we describe the experimental methods used to obtain Erk phosphorylation data and
the algorithmic methods used for sensitivity analysis and parameter screening.
3.1. Experimental Protocols
3.1.1. Cell Lines
Chicken DT40 B-cells lacking Syk were obtained from Dr. Tomohiro Kurosaki. Cells
were cultured in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% chicken
serum, 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 IU/mL penicillin G, and
100 μg/mL streptomycin. Stable DT40 cell lines expressing analog sensitive Syk-AQL-EGFP
(R428Q/M429L/M442A, referred to as Syk-AQL) were constructed using the Lenti-X Tet-On
Advanced Inducible 105 Expression System (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA). To constitutively
express the tetracycline-controlled transactivator, rtTA, in the Tet-On inducible system, the HEK293
cells were ﬁrst infected with viral particles containing the pLVX Tet-On Advanced Regulator.
Lentiviral particles were generated by co-transfecting HEK293T cells with 4 μg of pLVX-Tet-On,
4 μg of pHR’-CMV-ΔR8.20 vpr, and 2 μg of pHR’-CMV-VSVG using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The supernatants containing viral particles were harvested 48 h
post-transfection and used to infect Syk-deﬁcient DT40 cells. Two days after infection, cells were
selected with 500 μg/mL G418 and screened for rtTA expression. Cells constitutively expressing
rtTA protein were infected with lentiviral particles packaged with pLVX-Tight-Puro-Syk-AQL-EGFP
as described above. After 48 h, cells were selected with 1 μg/mL puromycin and these cells
were treated with 1 μg/mL doxycycline to induce Syk-AQL expression followed by screening for
expression by Western blotting.

134
3.1.2. Cellular Activation Assay
For the analysis of Erk phosphorylation, DT40 Syk-AQL-EGFP cells were treated with
or without goat-anti-mouse IgM (10 μg/mL) for the indicated periods of time at 37 ◦ C and
then lysed in buffer containing 25% sucrose, 2.5% SDS, 25 mM Tris/2.5 mM EDTA, 2.5 mg
pyronin Y, and 2% 2-mercaptoethanol. The DNA in lysates was sheared by passing through a
26 G × 1/2 in needle. Proteins in the lysate were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to
polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membrane, and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-pERK (Cell
Signaling p44/p42 MAPK (T202/Y204) rabbit 4370S), and anti-Syk (Santa Cruz N-19 rabbit)
antibodies. The results of these assays were used for parameter screening and will be referenced
in the results section.
3.2. Sensitivity Analysis
Our ﬁrst objective was to identify parameters that produce behavior that ﬁts B cell data. This
is important as our nominal parameters largely came from parameters estimated by ﬁtting to T cell
data. In order to obtain a computationally tractable search, we ﬁrst conducted a sensitivity analysis to
identify the parameters with the greatest inﬂuence on model output associated with our available data.
We were concerned with ﬁtting the model output to Erkp and IκB data reported by Healy et al.
in [8], Erkp data obtained as described in the previous section, and NF-κB data reported by
Oh et al. in [1]. Recall that Erkp denotes the sum of singly and doubly phosphorylated
Erk. The experimental conditions we sought to simulate were administrations of ligand at
time t = 0 in doses ranging from 5.5 to 150 μg/mL. The data from Healy et al. was used
for model ﬁtting through parameter screening, and so the form of this data was taken into
consideration during sensitivity analysis. The measurements taken by Healy et al. were reported
relative to the basal or unstimulated phosphorylation of a species. Thus, to evaluate the ﬁtness
of a set of parameters, we ran the model to steady state and recorded the value of xBasal
out ,
where out = Erkp or IκB throughout all subsequent sections, before continuing the simulation
with the addition of ligand.
Fitness was quantiﬁed using the objective
Jout = (yobs − ysimulated )/σout

(1)

Given that the basal and simulated values both depend on parameters, for our initial sensitivity
analysis we chose to compute the sensitivity of
ysim =

(tobs , pk )
xStimulation
out
xBasal
(p
k)
out

(2)

with respect to variations in parameters pk . Note that pk is the k th point in our parameter screening.
To estimate the uncertainty in the data σout for Equation (1), we assumed a linear dependence of σout
on yobs and conducted a linear regression using the information in Figure 2C of [8] . We found that
the error in the measurements could be reasonably approximated by
σout = 0.0127 + 0.3084 · yobs

(3)

135
where yobs is an observed measurement. Given the total number of model parameters and the cost
associated with varying them, we partitioned parameters into seven distinct groups and conducted a
sensitivity analysis with respect to each group when determining which parameters to screen initially.
These groups of parameters were detrained using natural divisions such as BCR dynamics, Syk
dynamics, regulatory enzyme and Lyn dynamics, Erk pathway dynamics, etc. A study by Zheng [2]
comparing local derivative-based sensitivity methods and global variance-based methods found that
global parameter sensitivities were necessary to capture model behavior when considering a large
parameter space, but that there were no signiﬁcant difference between Sobol analysis and the other
variance based methods considered. Given the relative independence of these groups, we calculated
only primary Sobol sensitivities [17] to estimate the sensitivity of the outputs, normalized as in
V arpk (Ep=pk [xStimulation
| pk ])
out
, for a
Equation (2), to each speciﬁed parameter. The sensitivity, Spk (t) =
V ar(xStimulation
)
out
given parameter was computed at integer values t = 0, . . . , 30 using the method based on sparse-grid
interpolation as described in [18]. This expression is designed to capture the relative sensitivity of
the output as a function of one particular parameter pk , averaged over the other parameters. That is,
if we ﬁx pk , we can determine the average behavior as we vary the remaining parameters, and then
determine how this average changes as a function of pk . These calculations were carried out in log
space in each parameter, with a range of one order of magnitude above and below the nominal value
for each parameter.
To match the conditions in much of that in [8], we used 20 μg/mL for the stimulation amount
at time t = 0. For each parameter considered, we calculated the median of the sensitivities for
that parameter over the times considered. The value 0.15 was found to be a natural threshold for
each group, and if the median was less than 0.15, we concluded the parameter was insensitive and
excluded it from future parameter screening. This criterion left us with 12 parameters to consider for
the parameter screening. Plots of these sensitivity values are included in Supplementary Materials.
3.3. Parameter Screening
Using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS), we screened parameter space for points that we consider
acceptable if they produce simulations satisfying |Jout | ≤ η or equivalently
yobs − ησ ≤ ysim ≤ yobs + ησ

(4)

The ﬁrst screening used the following data from Healy et al.: an Erk measurement at time
t = 5 minutes and dose responses for IκB all measured at time t = 15 minutes. The doses provided
in the dose response experiment were 5.5, 16.5, 50, and 150 μg/mL.
The second screening was with respect to our data and also used the condition Equation (4) to
determine acceptability. However, in the acceptability condition for this screening, we modiﬁed the
calculation of ysim in that we calculate phosphorylation relative to the ending value rather than the
basal value. That is, the signal intensities for the Western blots from our data were normalized by

136
their ending phosphorylation levels to avoid the magniﬁcation of errors that would result from a small
initial value. Applying the same normalization procedure to simulated data gives the form
ysim =

xStimulation
(tobs , pk )
out

(tf inal , pk )

(5)

In this case the uncertainty in our experimental measurements was determined by calculating the
standard deviation of the three replicates.
The data from Oh et al. [1] consisted of data for wild-type and mutant B cells, which featured
Syk-AQL. The mutant data was reported relative to wild-type activity. The wild-type data was used
to ensure that we achieved reasonable behavior in NF-κB after using data from Healy et al. to ﬁt
IκB, the model variable that directly preceded NF-κB. Using sensitive parameters relating to Syk
dynamics as a guide to select a small subset of parameters to tune manually, the mutant data was
used to determine a separate parameter set to reproduces this mutant (Syk-AQL) behavior.
3.4. Contour Analysis
In order to investigate the dependence of Erk and NF-κB activation on ligand–receptor binding
rates, we simulated the model at a dose of 20 μg/mL anti-BCR over a product grid of forward and
reverse binding rates. This was done for each of wild-type, mutant with no orthogonal inhibitor, and
mutant with a dose of 1 μM orthogonal inhibitor. The parameter grid was constructed using evenly
spaced points in log scale over ranges for forward and reverse binding rates found in literature [4,6].
In order to avoid numerical inaccuracies associated with overly stiff parameters, we halted any
simulation that took longer than ﬁfteen minutes during the contour analysis. For these grid points,
we used the built-in MATLAB function griddata in order to interpolate the corresponding values.

The parameter screening, sensitivity analysis, and contour analysis scripts were implemented in
MATLAB 2012a. The script was parallelized to run on a Sun Server X3-2 server with two Intel
Xeon E5-2690 processors and 160 GB RAM. For the parameter screening and sensitivity analyses,
parameter ranges were set to two orders of magnitude on either side of the nominal parameters for
each group except the fourth group (see Section 4.2 and Table 1).

4. Results
4.1. Sensitive Parameters
Primary Sobol sensitivities [17] were calculated for each output and we analyzed the distribution
of the sensitivities over time. The following parameters were considered during the parameter
screening. Inclusion in the parameter screening meant that the parameter did not violate the criterion
that median S(t) < 0.15. The box and whisker plots for parameter sensitivities leading to this
criterion are included in the supplementary information Figure S1. We ultimately sought for the
model to produce a graded response to increasing dosages of anti-BCR stimulation in Syk342 and
then let that gradation propagate downstream; thus, the results of the sensitivity analysis match what
one would expect as they correspond to key signaling reactions.
The parameters in group one correspond to BCR dynamics, and rw0kf speciﬁcally represents the
forward rate of the ligand binding reaction to the BCR. Group two contains parameters related to
Syk activation, and rw7kr is the reverse rate of the phosphorylation reaction for the Y342 tyrosine on
Syk. Parameter rw9kf is the forward rate in the phosphorylation reaction for the Y317 tyrosine on
Syk that has already been phosphorylated at Y342. Group three is comprised of parameters from the
regulatory enzyme subsystem. A sensitivity analysis was not conducted with respect to this group
due to issues with stiffness. We describe next steps to examine this stiffness and future plans to
expand the regulatory enzyme subsystem to become fully dynamic in Section 5.
Groups four and ﬁve consisted of parameters relating to rates for reactions involving medial
signaling components BLNK, PLCγ, Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK). For group four, parameter
rw15kf is the rate at which BLNK is phosphorylated by Syk342, while rw16kf and rw16kr are
the forward and backward rates for the binding of PLCγ to the linker protein BLNK. In group ﬁve,
r12skf is the forward rate at which Syk342 phosphorylates bound PLCγ. Parameters r13kf and r13kr
represent the rate at which P LCγ phosphorylates the phospholipid PIP2 and the corresponding rate
of dephosphorylation. Finally, group six is made up of medial signaling parameters for reactions
involving the kinase PKC and also the downstream MAPK pathway leading to Erk. Parameter
r18kf is the rate at which Erk is phosphorylated by MEK. Parameter r19kf is the rate at which
the enzyme SOS binds to phosphorylated BLNK. Finally, Group seven consists of parameters for
reactions related to the NFκB pathways. Here r38kf is the rate of phosphorylation of IκB by the
kinase IKK.
4.2. Parameter Screening and Fitting
To ﬁnd a set of parameters that qualitatively match a variety of data, we ﬁrst screened with
respect to the data from Healy et al. [8] and required |JErkp | ≤ 1 and |JIκB(dose1) | ≤ 2. We
found seven parameter vectors that met the criteria among the 1800 candidates considered. Due
to large per-simulation time requirements, large objective values for doses #3 and #4 of the dose
response experiments, and tradeoffs between Erk costs and IκB costs, we determined we would need
to manually tune parameters related to IκB to achieve reasonable ﬁts at all four doses.

We next screened the seven accepted parameter vectors for ﬁtness to the Erkp data obtained as
in Section 3.1.2 and normalized as in Equation (5) with a threshold of η = 1. From this screening,
we selected one parameter vector p based upon the smoothness of its Erkp time course, time to

139
full Erkp activation, agreement with intermediate Erkp data points, and smoothness of non-degraded
IκB time courses. Simulations using p are shown in Figure 3. For this Erkp data, we did not do
any local optimization, but rather focused on the qualitative response. The right panel in Figure 3
indicates both the variability in experimental data and good qualitative agreement between these data
and simulation.
From the vector p, we improved our ﬁts for IκB by manually tuning parameters in the IκB
pathway. The parameters that were adjusted were the rate of IκB production and the rate of NF-κB
production. This ﬁnal manual tuning led us to the parameter vector we call p∗W T . The ﬁnal ﬁts for
IκB can be seen in Figure 4. We were able to achieve qualitative agreement to the wild-type NF-κB
data of Oh et al. [1] without any further changes to parameters, as seen in the left panel of Figure 5.

Since mutant Syk-AQL has experimentally different NF-κB response compared with WT, we
manually tuned the sensitive parameters associated with Syk dynamics. We found that increasing
the rate of Y317 phosphorylation rw9kf allowed us to ﬁt two of the three nonzero data points.
The agreement to the mutant data with this new parameter vector p∗M utant can be seen in the right
panel of Figure 5. Intuitively, this corresponds to inhibiting a larger fraction of Syk, and thus there
is less Syk available to propagate a signal. Interestingly, we could also achieve the same ﬁts to
mutant data by lowering the total amount of Syk in the cell. This was reminiscent of the effects
of the drug tetracycline, which can regulate the amount of kinase prior to stimulation. Note that
the measurements used from Oh et al. were reported relative to phosphorylation levels observed
following an experiment where cells were stimulated using PMA and ionomyocin. We do not
simulate the effects of ionomyocin in this work since calcium is not modeled, so our simulated
activity in the right panel of Figure 5 is relative to the ﬁnal phosphorylation level observed in
simulated wild-type activity.

140
In Figure 6, we plot predicted dose response curves associated with the parameter vector p∗M utant
as a function of ligand dose, one curve for each of several doses of orthogonal inhibitor (the OI doses
are speciﬁed in μM in the legend). The simulation values are given at t = 5 minutes. To investigate
the qualitative response, we express the ligand dose in each case as a percentage of saturating dose.
As seen in Figure 6, our model exhibits a clear dose response to antigen. Additionally, it is clear
in the ﬁgure that the orthogonal inhibitor limits the Erkp response; activity level is reduced as the
amount of inhibitor increases, suggesting that active Syk is critical to propagate the signal and may
be a limiting quantity.

activities. The curves show simulated relative activity for Erkp measured at t = 5 after
applying ligand and orthogonal inhibitor (μM) simultaneously. All curves have been

The color of the curve corresponds to the amount of orthogonal inhibitor speciﬁed in
the legend.

4.3. Contour Analysis
As shown by Healy et al. in [8], there is full signaling activity through the Erk pathway and
limited activity in the NF-κB pathway during an anergic response. To investigate a variety of afﬁnities
that could induce anergy, we vary the forward and reverse kinetic rates for BCR binding and consider
the cell activity as a function of the binding rates. We seek to ﬁnd areas of the grid of binding
rates that lead to high Erkp activity and low NF-κB activity. We have constructed contour plots
for normalized Erkp activity minus normalized NF-κB activity for several scenarios: WT B cells,
mutant B cells without OI added, mutant B cells with 1 μM of OI added. The contour plots allow us
to ascertain relationships between the binding rates associated with the responses we found.
As seen in Figure 7, for each scenario the response at low values of the reverse binding rate is
qualitatively different from the response at higher values of reverse binding rate. At low values, the
response depends only on the forward binding rate, while at higher values the response depends
more or less linearly in log space on both binding rates. The slope for this linear relationship

141
is not 1, however, which would be the case if the response depended on the standard afﬁnity,
rw0
. As seen in the contour plots, the response above the value rw0kr > −0.5 is reasonably
Ka = rw0kf
kr
described as a function of log rw0kf − α log rw0kr . This leads to a kind of power law afﬁnity,
rw0
Ka,α = (rw0krkf)α , where the multiplier α = 3/4 is the reciprocal of the slope of the linear relationship
in the contour plot. The origin of the power law afﬁnity will be investigated in future analysis of the
dynamical system.

mutant with 1 μM orthogonal inhibitor. The diagonal black line has a slope equal to 4/3.
Regions with high values correspond to large Erkp response and small NF-κB response
(both responses normalized by their maximum WT activity), and hence possible regions
of anergy. Both rates are shown in log scale.

To illustrate these dependencies, we plot in Figure 8 the responses in the low reverse rate region
against the forward rate rw0kf and the responses in the high reverse rate region against the power
law afﬁnity. As expected from the contour plots, the plots in Figure 8 show a clear dependence on
forward rate alone in the region of low reverse rate and a reasonably clear dependence on the power
law afﬁnity in the region of high reverse rate.
There are higher plateaus of Erkp-NF-κB present in the mutant plots (middle and right) of
Figure 8. Plots of each quantity separately (not shown) demonstrate that plateau levels of Erkp are
relatively unchanged while NF-κB is suppressed in these mutants. These higher plateaus lead to the
question of whether it is easier to induce and observe anergy in B cells with Syk-AQL than in WT. If
so, this could have important implications for attempts to produce mice with these mutant B cells.
In order to further understand the effect of Syk-AQL and OI on Syk, we consider the allocation of
Syk in each scenario. Using the power law afﬁnity, we ﬁnd that the variables xSykb , xSyk342 , and x317
all follow a sigmoidal course. Note that a percentage of total Syk is also allocated to other variables,
such as free, unbound Syk, and to Syk bound to clathrin; since our focus is on the active forms of
Syk, we omit these other forms. We ﬁnd that Syk-AQL with no orthogonal inhibitor mimics fairly
closely the response of wild-type, except that Syk342 is somewhat reduced. As expected, Syk-AQL
with orthogonal inhibitor shows a marked decrease in these three forms of Syk, with the balance
migrating to inhibited Syk.

The analysis in this section has several possible biological implications. The moderate reduction
in Syk-AQL activity compared with wild-type suggests that the level of NF-κB activation, which
is reduced in Syk-AQL cells relative to wild-type, is more sensitive to small reductions in kinase
activity than Erkp activation, which is essentially unchanged. Since this proﬁle of high Erkp and
reduced NF-κB is consistent with anergy, this implies that anergy is particularly sensitive to small
changes in catalytic activity. A second possible implication derives from the observed dependence of
Erkp and NF-κB on the power law afﬁnity. This implies that B cells may respond to certain details
of binding and unbinding rates for ligands rather than simple afﬁnity alone. These observations
provide a platform upon which to plan future experimental approaches and to predict experimental
outcomes to further evaluate the role of Syk and changes in its catalytic activity in determining cell
fate decisions following BCR engagement.

inhibitor to the mutant cell there is the expected decrease in overall activity; the balance
is accounted for by inactive forms of Syk.

4.4. Independent Dataset Comparison
We compared the model to an independent dataset from Chaudhri et al. [6]. These data were
not used in screening the parameters; the comparison is presented in Figure 10. The Chaudhri
data include ligand concentrations that are much smaller than those available in our training data
and indicate a relatively large activation even at very small ligand concentrations. Our model
displays signiﬁcantly smaller activity levels than those seen in the Chaudhri data at these low ligand
concentrations. We believe that further parameter screening could produce better agreement to these
data, but the underlying question is somewhat deeper in view of the phenomenon of anergy, in which
B cells display reduced response to higher levels of ligand concentration. Experiments have shown
that a low constant signal [15] can drive a B cell to become anergic and thus relatively unresponsive to
the presence of antigen. Hence the question is not only what is the effective level of phosphorylation
of Erk at low doses of ligand but also what is the effect of such low doses over extended periods
of time. This is consistent with our model predictions of relatively high levels of Erkp activity and
low levels of NF-κB activity in response to small amounts of active Syk. However, our model also
suggests that the details of forward and reverse binding rates may also play a role in anergy.

5. Conclusions and Future Directions
We have constructed a deterministic model of B cell signaling, with a focus on the role of Syk
in modulating the activity of Erk and NF-κB. In particular, we include dynamics for the mutant
kinase Syk-AQL, which experimentally displays dynamics that are qualitatively similar to wild-type
dynamics in the absence of orthogonal inhibitor but can be modulated through the addition of
orthogonal inhibitor. With the correct choice of parameters, our model reproduces data from recent
cellular assays and qualitatively matches trends from datasets in the literature.
We sought to explore the kinetic rate constants associated with ligand binding that produced high
relative activation of Erkp and low relative activation of NF-κB. These signaling conditions have
been previously associated with anergy. We found that at different levels of rw0kr our responses
actually depended on quantities other than the standard afﬁnity constant. For low levels of rw0kr ,
the model predicts that the response depends only on the forward rate of BCR binding rw0kf . At
higher levels of rw0kr , the model predicts that the response depends on a power law form of the
rw0
afﬁnity constant, Ka,α = (rw0krkf)α . These predictions were robust for WT and mutant simulations.
Given the complexity of the dynamical system, a model reduction will likely be necessary in order
to analytically investigate the origin of the power law afﬁnity underlying the model response.
Insight into the model prediction that NF-κB is more sensitive than Erkp to changes in signaling
activity is found when considering the relative ampliﬁcation in each pathway. For both Erkp and
NF-κB, we considered the relative change in response between wild-type and mutant with orthogonal
inhibitor simulations. The relative changes were both with respect to the signaling component DAG,
the last signaling component to inﬂuence both pathways. We calculated the difference between Erkp
in wild-type and mutant+OI simulations and then divided by wild-type Erkp simulation to get the
normalized change in Erkp. We made a similar calculation using DAG, normalized by wild-type
DAG simulation, and then took the ratio of the normalized change in Erkp to the normalized change
in DAG. This gives us a measure of the ampliﬁcation of the DAG signal in the response of Erkp.

145
We likewise calculated the simulated ampliﬁcation of DAG in the response of NF-κB. We found the
ampliﬁcation for Erkp to be ≈0.28 and the ampliﬁcation for NF-κB to be ≈0.99. That is, the response
of NF-κB to DAG is nearly 1:1, while the response of Erkp to DAG is reduced to roughly one-fourth
of the incoming signal. These estimates agree with the ﬁndings in contour analysis that if there is a
reduction in signaling activity to Syk, and thus DAG, then NF-κB will be more affected than Erkp.
The mechanisms and parameters in these two pathways are structurally distinct: the Erkp pathway
is based on mass-action kinetics, while the NF-κB pathway includes promotion of PKCΘ∗ by DAG
and a feedback loop involving NF-κB. Further experiments are needed to validate these predictions.
One approach to this might be to use the DAG analog PMA as a means of effectively altering the
level of DAG and investigate the resulting changes in Erkp and NF-κB experimentally.
Planned expansions to the model include stimulation by ionomycin, the addition of Ca2+
dynamics, and the addition of the NFAT pathway. We plan also to restructure the dynamics of CD45,
which is constant in the current version of the model; this modiﬁcation will impact the regulatory
enzyme dynamics as they are driven by CD45 activity.
One of the difﬁculties with this model is the stiffness of the differential equations; for a large
subset of parameter space the model takes one to tens of minutes for a simulation of 30 minutes. This
stiffness limits our ability to explore the parameter space fully. Model stiffness prevented sensitivity
analysis with respect to the parameters for regulatory enzyme dynamics, which made up group three
of Table 1. Stiffness also presented issues during other sensitivity analysis trials and during the
parameter screening and so we will seek to address this issue in future studies. We believe the
improvements to CD45 dynamics will alleviate at least some of the issues with stiffness.
As seen in the right panel of Figure 6, there is a discrepancy between our model and the activity
observed by Chaudhri et al. [6]. It is not clear whether this limitation can be resolved via the tuning
of ligand binding parameters or if there are additional mechanisms needed to capture the response to
lower levels of ligand.
In general, the ways in which the modulation of Syk changes the response of Erk, NFAT, and
NF-κB is an important question of interest for our group. Our model is an early attempt to disentangle
the behavior of Syk from these downstream responses. While there is much left to be improved in
our model, we believe that it will be an important tool in our search to understand the mechanisms
underlying the onset of anergy in B cells. Beyond that, we believe that our model may be used as
in [3] as the basis for model-informed control strategies to achieve desired cellular responses.

Dynamic Modeling of the Human Coagulation Cascade Using
Reduced Order Effective Kinetic Models
Adithya Sagar and Jeffrey D. Varner
Abstract: In this study, we present a novel modeling approach which combines ordinary differential
equation (ODE) modeling with logical rules to simulate an archetype biochemical network, the
human coagulation cascade. The model consisted of ﬁve differential equations augmented with
several logical rules describing regulatory connections between model components, and unmodeled
interactions in the network. This formulation was more than an order of magnitude smaller than
current coagulation models, because many of the mechanistic details of coagulation were encoded
as logical rules. We estimated an ensemble of likely model parameters (N = 20) from in vitro
extrinsic coagulation data sets, with and without inhibitors, by minimizing the residual between
model simulations and experimental measurements using particle swarm optimization (PSO). Each
parameter set in our ensemble corresponded to a unique particle in the PSO. We then validated the
model ensemble using thrombin data sets that were not used during training. The ensemble predicted
thrombin trajectories for conditions not used for model training, including thrombin generation for
normal and hemophilic coagulation in the presence of platelets (a signiﬁcant unmodeled component).
We then used ﬂux analysis to understand how the network operated in a variety of conditions, and
global sensitivity analysis to identify which parameters controlled the performance of the network.
Taken together, the hybrid approach produced a surprisingly predictive model given its small size,
suggesting the proposed framework could also be used to dynamically model other biochemical
networks, including intracellular metabolic networks, gene expression programs or potentially even
cell free metabolic systems.

1. Introduction
Developing mathematical models of biochemical networks is a signiﬁcant facet of systems
biology. Modeling approaches differ in their degree of detail, where the choice of approach is
often determined by prior knowledge, or model requirements [1]. Ordinary differential equation
(ODE) models are common tools for modeling biochemical systems because of their ability to
capture dynamics and encode mechanism. However, ODE models typically come with difﬁcult
(or sometimes impossible) parameter identiﬁcation problems. For example, Gadkar et al. showed
that even with near-perfect information, it was often impossible to identify all the parameters in
typical signal transduction models [2]. However, it is not clear whether we actually need precise
estimates for all model parameters. Bailey suggested more than a decade ago, that achieving
qualitative or even quantitative understanding of biological systems should not require complete
structural and parametric knowledge [3]. Since Bailey’s complex biology with no parameters
hypothesis, Sethna showed that model performance is typically sensitive to only a few parameters,

149
a characteristic seemingly universal to multi-parameter models referred to as sloppiness [4]. Thus,
reasonable predictions may be possible, despite parametric uncertainty, if a few critical parameters
are well-deﬁned. For example, Tasseff et al., showed in a model of Retinoic acid (RA) induced
differentiation of HL-60 cells, that correct predictions were possible even when 75% of the
parameters were known only to an order of magnitude [5]. Perhaps more importantly, ODE
models require signiﬁcant mechanistic information, thereby limiting their utility in poorly understood
systems, or conversely explode in size when considering multiple pathways or subsystems. Toward
this challenge, logical modeling is an emerging paradigm that encodes causal relationships between
model components using quasi-mechanistic non-linear transfer functions [6]. Logical models are
highly ﬂexible, and despite their simplicity, they have captured rich behaviors in a variety of systems
important to human health [7–9]. However, modeling complex dynamics with logical models
is challenging. Thus, there is an unmet need for a third approach which combines ODEs and
logical models, where ODEs could encode mechanistic information, while missing or incomplete
mechanistic knowledge can be approximated using a logical approach.
In this study, we developed a hybrid approach which combined ODE modeling with logical rules
to model a well studied biochemical network, the human coagulation system. Coagulation is an
archetype proteolytic cascade involving both positive and negative feedback [10–12]. Coagulation is
mediated by a family proteases in the circulation, called factors and a key group of blood cells,
called platelets. The central process in coagulation is the conversion of prothrombin (fII), an
inactive coagulation factor, to the master protease thrombin (FIIa). Thrombin generation involves
three phases, initiation, ampliﬁcation and termination [13,14]. Initiation requires a trigger event,
for example vessel injury, which leads to the activation of factor VII (FVIIa). Two converging
pathways, the extrinsic and intrinsic cascades, then process and amplify this initial coagulation
signal. The extrinsic cascade is generally believed to be the main mechanism of thrombinogenesis in
the blood [15–17]. Initially, thrombin is produced upon cleavage of prothrombin by ﬂuid phase
activated factor X (FXa), which itself has been activated by Tissue Factor/activated factor VII
(TF/FVIIa) [10]. Picomolar amounts of thrombin then activate the cofactors factors V and VIII
(fV and fVIII) and platelets, leading to the formation of the tenase and prothrombinase complexes
on activated platelets. These complexes amplify the early coagulation signal by further activating
FXa, and directly converting prothrombin to thrombin. There are several control points in the
cascade that inhibit thrombin formation, and eventually terminate thrombin generation. Tissue
Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI) inhibits FXa formation catalyzed by TF/FVIIa, while antithrombin
III (ATIII) neutralizes several of the proteases generated during coagulation, including thrombin.
Thrombin itself also inadvertently plays a role in its own inhibition; thrombin, through interaction
with thrombomodulin, protein C and endothelial cell protein C receptor (EPCR), converts protein
C to activated protein C (APC) which attenuates the coagulation response by proteolytic cleavage
of fV/FVa and fVIII/FVIIIa. Termination occurs after either prothrombin is consumed, or thrombin
formation is neutralized by inhibitors such as APC or ATIII.
Previous coagulation models have typically been formulated as systems of nonlinear ordinary
differential equations, using mass action or more complex kinetics, to describe the rates of

150
biochemical conversions [18–22]. Mechanistic ODE coagulation models from our laboratory [23,24]
were built upon the earlier studies of Jones and Mann [25], Hockin et al. [26], and later
Butenas et al. [27] who developed and then subsequently reﬁned highly mechanistic coagulation
models. Other laboratories have also expanded upon Hockin et al. for example by exploring
the intrinsic pathway, the role of stochastic ﬂuctuations in coagulation [28], and the dynamics of
thrombin mediated clot formation [29] and ﬁbrinolysis [30]. Other aspects of coagulation have also
been modeled, such as platelet biochemistry [31], multi-scale models of clot formation [32,33],
and transport inside clots [34]. However, these previous studies were largely based upon extensive
mechanistic knowledge. This is possible because blood, while enormously complex, can be
systematically interrogated. Other systems, such as intracellular signaling networks, are much
more difﬁcult to experimentally interrogate. Towards this unmet need, we formulated a hybrid
modeling approach which combines ODEs and logical rules to model biochemical processes for
which a complete mechanistic understanding is missing. We tested this approach by modeling the
human coagulation cascade. Others have also constructed reduced order human coagulation models.
Recently, Papadopoulos and co-workers constructed a phenomenological mathematical model for
thrombin generation [35]. Using four ordinary differential equations and six parameters, they derived
an expression describing the temporal evolution of thrombin generation in a variety of cases. The
reduced order Papadopoulos model showed good agreement with experimental data, and underscored
that model reduction is possible even for complex positive feedback systems like coagulation.
However, the Papadopoulos model was focused on thrombin generation, and had a lesser emphasis
on the inﬂuence of physiological inhibitors such as ATIII or the protein C pathway. In this study,
we focused on building a reduced order coagulation model that included the physiological inhibitors
using a hybrid strategy. The hybrid model consisted of only ﬁve differential equations augmented
with several logical rules. Thus, the model was more than an order of magnitude smaller than
comparable purely ODE models in the literature. We estimated the model parameters from in vitro
extrinsic coagulation data sets, in the presence of ATIII, with and without the protein C pathway.
We then compared the model predictions with thrombin data sets, for both normal and hemophilic
coagulation, that were not used for model training. Once validated, we performed ﬂux and sensitivity
analysis on the model to estimate which parameters were critical to model performance in several
conditions. The reduced order hybrid approach produced a surprisingly predictive coagulation model,
suggesting this framework could potentially be used to model other biochemical networks important
to human health.
2. Results
2.1. Formulation of Reduced Order Coagulation Models
We developed a reduced order extrinsic coagulation model to test our hybrid modeling
approach (Figure 1). The core of our model was based upon the earlier work of Ismagilov and
coworkers [36–39], where we added initiation, factor dependence, and speciﬁc inhibition terms to
the earlier simpliﬁed model. A trigger event initiates thrombin formation (FIIa) from prothrombin

151
(fII) through a lumped initiation step. This step loosely represents the initial activation of thrombin
by activated FXa. Once activated, thrombin catalyzes its own formation (ampliﬁcation step), and
inhibition via the conversion of protein C to activated protein C (APC). Antithrombin III (ATIII)
inhibits ampliﬁcation, while APC and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) potentially inhibit
both initiation and ampliﬁcation. All initiation and inhibition processes, as well as the dependence
of ampliﬁcation upon other coagulation factors, was approximated using our rule-based approach
(Figure 2). Individual regulatory contributions to the activity of pathway enzymes were integrated
into control coefﬁcients (v’s) using an integration rule (min/max). These control coefﬁcients then
modiﬁed the rates of model processes at each time step. Hill-like transfer functions 0 ≤ f (Z) ≤ 1
quantiﬁed the contribution of components upon a target process. Components were either individual
inhibitor or activator levels or some function of levels, e.g., the product of factor levels. In this study,
Z corresponded to the abundance of individual inhibitors or activators, with the exception of the
dependence of ampliﬁcation upon speciﬁc coagulation factors (modeled as the product of factors).
When a process was potentially sensitive to multiple inputs, logical integration rules were used to
select which transfer functions inﬂuenced the process at any given time. In our proof of concept
model, we used a winner takes all strategy; the maximum or minimum transfer function was selected
at any given time step. However, other integration rules are certainly possible. Taken together, while
the reduced order coagulation model encodes signiﬁcant biological complexity, it is highly compact
(consisting of only ﬁve differential equations). Thus, it will serve as an excellent proof of principle
example to study the reduction of a highly complex human subsystem.
2.2. Identiﬁcation of Model Parameters Using Particle Swarm Optimization
A critical challenge for any dynamic model is the estimation of kinetic parameters. We estimated
kinetic and control parameters simultaneously from eight in vitro time-series coagulation data sets
with and without the protein C pathway. The residual between model simulations and experimental
measurements was minimized using particle swarm optimization (PSO). A population of particles
(N = 20) was initialized with randomized kinetic and control parameters and allowed to search
for parameter vectors that minimized the residual. However, not all parameters were varied
simultaneously. We partitioned the parameter estimation problem into two subproblems based upon
the biological organization of the training data; (i) estimation of parameters associated with thrombin
formation in the absence of the protein C pathway and (ii) estimation of parameters associated with
the protein C pathway. Only those parameters associated with each subproblem were varied during
the optimization procedure for that subproblem, e.g., thrombin parameters were not varied during the
protein C subproblem. The PSO procedure was run for 20 generations for each subproblem, where
each generation was 1200 iterations. The best particle from each generation was used to generate the
particle population for the next generation. We rotated the subproblems, starting with subproblem 1
in the ﬁrst generation.

trigger compound, e.g., TF/FVIIa initiates thrombin production (FIIa) from prothrombin
(fII). Once activated, thrombin catalyzes its own activation (ampliﬁcation step), as well
as its own inhibition via the conversion of protein C to activated protein C (APC).
APC and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) inhibit initiation and ampliﬁcation,
while antithrombin III (ATIII) directly inhibits thrombin. All inhibition steps and
trigger-induced initiation were modeled using a rule-based approach. Likewise, the
dependence of ampliﬁcation on other coagulation factors was also modeled using a
rule-based approach. The abundance of the highlighted species (in the dashed boxes)
was governed by an ordinary differential equation. All other species were assumed to
be constant.

The experimental training data for parameter estimation was reproduced from the experiments of
Butenas and co-workers [40]. In these experiments thrombin generation was initiated by FVIIa-TF
using mean plasma concentrations of coagulation proteins and inhibitors. To prepare FVIIa-TF,
TF (0.5 nmol/L) was relipidated into 400 μmol/L of phospholipid vesicles (PCPS) by incubation in
20 mmol/L HEPES, 150 mmol/L NaCl, and 2 mmol/L CaCl2 pH 7.4 (HBS/Ca2+ ) for 30 min at 37 ◦ C.
The relipidated TF was incubated with 10 pmol/L factor VIIa for 20 min to allow the formation of
FVIIa-TF. Factors V, VIII and thrombomodulin (Tm) (when protein C activation is required) were
added to FVIIa-TF complex. Thrombin generation was then initiated by adding equal volumes of this
mixture with a mixture containing prothrombin, factor IX and factor X, TFPI, AT-III and protein C
(added when required), protein S (added when required) and factor XI (added when required). In the
training data, 5 pmol/L FVIIa-TF was used along with 200 μmol/L of phospholipid vesicles (PCPS)
to initiate thrombin generation. All other the coagulation factors and inhibitors i.e., factors X, IX,

153
V, and VIII, prothrombin, TFPI and AT-III, protein C and protein S (when applicable) were at their
mean plasma concentrations.

The reduced order coagulation model captured the role of initial prothrombin abundance, and the
decay of the thrombin signal following from ATIII activity (Figure 3). However, we systematically
under-predicted the thrombin peak and the strength of ATIII inhibition in this training data set. On

156
the other hand, with ﬁxed thrombin parameters, we captured peak thrombin values and the decay
of the thrombin signal (at least for the 150% fII case) in the presence of both ATIII and the protein
C pathway (Figure 4). Lastly, we were unable to capture global differences in initiation time across
separate data sets with a single ensemble of model parameters. These differences likely resulted from
normal experimental variability. For example, different thrombin generation experiments within the
training data (at the same physiological factor levels) had signiﬁcantly different initiation times (data
not shown). However, the inability to globally capture initiation time also highlighted a potential
shortcoming of the initiation module within the model. To capture the variability in initiation time
across training data sets, we included a constant time-delay parameter (TD ) for each data group.
The delay parameter was constant within a data set, but allowed to vary across training data sets.
Introduction of the delay parameter allowed the model to simulate multiple training data sets using a
single ensemble of model parameters. Taken together, the model identiﬁcation results suggested that
our hybrid approach could reproduce a panel of thrombin generation data sets in the neighborhood of
physiological factor and inhibitor concentrations. However, it was unclear whether the reduced order
model could predict new data, without updating the model parameters.
2.3. Validation of the Reduced Order Coagulation Model
We tested the predictive power of the reduced order coagulation model with validation data
sets not used during model training. Two validation data sets were used, thrombin generation
for various prothrombin and ATIII concentrations with the protein C pathway, and thrombin
generation in normal versus hemophilic plasma in the presence of the protein C pathway. Lastly,
we compared the qualitative output of the model to rFVIIa addition in the presence of hemophilia.
The hemophilia case was an especially difﬁcult test as it was taken from a different study
which used a plasma-based in vitro assay involving platelets instead of phospholipid vesicles
(PCPS). All kinetic and control parameters were ﬁxed for the validation simulations. The
only globally adjustable parameter TD , was ﬁxed within each validation data set but allowed
to vary between data sets. The reduced order model predicted the thrombin generation proﬁle
for ratios of prothrombin and ATIII in the absence of the protein C pathway (Figure 5).
Simulations near the physiological range (fII,ATIII) = (100%, 100%) or (125%, 75%) tracked
the measured thrombin values (Figure 5B,C). On the other hand, predictions for factor levels
outside of the physiological range (fII,ATIII) = (50%, 150%) or (150%, 50%), while qualitatively
consistent with measured thrombin values, did show signiﬁcant deviation from the measurements
(Figure 5A,D). Likewise, simulations of thrombin generation in normal versus hemophilia (missing
both fVIII and fIX) were consistent with measured thrombin values (Figure 6). We modeled the
dependence of thrombin ampliﬁcation on factor levels using a product rule (Z = f V ×f X×f V III×
f IX), which was then was integrated using a min integration rule into the control variable governing
ampliﬁcation. Thus, in the absence of fVIII or fIX, the ampliﬁcation control variable evaluated to
zero, and the only thrombin produced was from initiation (Figure 6B). However, the decay of the
thrombin signal was underpredicted in the normal case (Figure 6A), while the activated thrombin
level was overpredicted in hemophilia simulations, although thrombin generation was far less than

157
normal (Figure 6B). Taken together, the reduced order model performed well in the physiological
range of factors, even with unmodeled components such as platelet activation in the hemophilia
data set.

in the absence of protein C pathway. All factors and control proteins were at their

The model ensemble predicted a direct correlation between thrombin generation and rFVIIa
addition in hemophilia (Figure 7). In the current model, we cannot distinguish between different
initiation sources, e.g., TF/FVIIa versus rFVIIa, as we have only a single lumped initiation source
(trigger). Thus, we simulated the addition of rFVIIa in hemophilia by removing fVIII and fIX
from the model, and modulating the initial level of trigger. Simulations with a baseline level of
trigger were consistent with the previous hemophilia simulations, where the only thrombin produced
was from initiation (Figure 7A, 1× trigger). However, as we increased the trigger strength, the
thrombin proﬁle began to approximate normal coagulation, showing a pronounced peak albeit
with a slower peak time (Figure 7B, t∗∗ > t∗ ). Further increases in trigger strength resulted in
decreased thrombin peak time and increased maximum thrombin values (Figure 7A, 50× trigger).
Thus, for large trigger values (200× trigger), the hemophilic thrombin proﬁle approximated normal
coagulation, where peak thrombin was achieved shortly after administration and 95% of the thrombin
was gone by 20 min after initiation. We performed ﬂux analysis to understand how the reduced
order coagulation model balanced initiation, ampliﬁcation and termination of thrombin generation
for normal and hemophilic coagulation. Analysis of the reaction ﬂux through the reduced order
network for thrombin generation in normal, hemophilia and rFVIIa-treated hemophilia identiﬁed
three distinct operational modes (Figure 8). We calculated the ﬂux through four lumped reactions,
initiation, ampliﬁcation, thrombin-induced APC generation and total thrombin inhibition (including

160
both APC and ATIII action). Directly after the addition of a trigger (e.g., TF/FVIIa or rFVIIa), the
lumped initiation ﬂux was the largest for all three cases. However, within a few minutes enough
thrombin was generated by the initiation mechanism to induce the ampliﬁcation stage. During
ampliﬁcation, thrombin catalyzes its own formation and inhibition by generating activated protein
C (APC), a potent inhibitor of the coagulation cascade. For normal coagulation, ampliﬁcation
and thrombin inhibition were the dominate reactions by 6 min after initiation (Figure 8, left).
After 10 min, the dominate reaction had shifted to thrombin inhibition (both ATIII and APC
action). In hemophilia (missing both fVIII and fIX), the ampliﬁcation reaction did not occur,
and thrombin was produced only by initiation (Figure 8, center). Initiation was quickly inhibited
by APC, and the thrombin level stabilized (eventually decaying at longer times because of ATIII
activity). Lastly, when 50× trigger was used to induce thrombin formation in hemophilia (absence
of fVIII/fIX), initiation mechanisms dominated for up to 6 min following initiation (Figure 8,
right). Similar to hemophilia alone, no ampliﬁcation occurred in the 50× trigger+hemophilia
case, and the rate of thrombin generation was extinguished by the combined action of ATIII and
APC. Taken together, the hybrid modeling approach captured the transition between the modes of
thrombin generation, as well as the role that inhibitors play in attenuating the thrombin generation
rate. Thus, the transfer function approach encoded the inhibitory logic of this cascade in the absence
of speciﬁc mechanism.

2.4. Global Sensitivity Analysis of the Reduced Order Coagulation Model
We conducted a global sensitivity analysis to estimate which parameters controlled the
performance of the reduced order model. We calculated the sensitivity of the time to maximum
thrombin (peak time) and the thrombin exposure (area under the thrombin curve) for different
levels of prothrombin, and protein C (Figure 9). Globally, 41% of the parameters shifted in
importance between the (fII,PC) = (50%, 0%) and (150%, 100%) cases for the peak thrombin time

162
(Figure 9A). The majority of these shifts involved the interaction between increased prothrombin
and the protein C pathway, while only 5% were directly associated with increased prothrombin
alone. The rate constant for thrombin ampliﬁcation was the most important parameter controlling
the peak thrombin time. While this parameter was differentially important for different prothrombin
levels, and in the presence or absence of the activated protein C pathway, it was consistently the
most sensitive parameter in the model. The saturation constant governing thrombin ampliﬁcation
was the second most important parameter, followed by the initiation control gain parameter.
Other important parameters inﬂuencing the thrombin peak time included the control gain for
activated protein C formation, and the rate constant controlling ATIII inhibition of thrombin activity.
On the other hand, only 27% of the model parameters were differentially sensitive between the
(fII,PC) = (50%, 0%) and (150%, 100%) cases for thrombin exposure (Figure 9B). Of these
parameters, all of the shifts were associated with the interplay between thrombin formation and
the protein C pathway. The rate constant controlling ATIII inhibition was the most important
parameter controlling the thrombin exposure. While this parameter was less important in the
presence of protein C for 150% prothrombin levels, it was signiﬁcantly above all other parameters.
Similar to the peak time, for 150% prothrombin, the control gain for activated protein C formation
was differentially important along with the rate constant controlling ampliﬁcation. However, the
ampliﬁcation parameter was much less important for thrombin exposure vs. peak time.
3. Discussion
In this study, we developed a reduced order model of the human coagulation cascade. We
modeled coagulation because it is well studied, has a complex architecture, and has an abundance
of experimental data available for model identiﬁcation and validation. However, coagulation was
just a proof of concept test of our approach. The proposed hybrid framework could also be used to
dynamically model other biochemical networks, including intracellular metabolic networks, gene
expression programs or potentially even cell free metabolic systems. The model consisted of
ﬁve differential equations augmented with several logical rules describing regulatory connections
between model components and unmodeled interactions in the network. We estimated model
parameters from in vitro extrinsic coagulation data sets, in the presence of ATIII, with and without the
protein C pathway. To estimate parameters, the residual between model simulations and experimental
measurements was minimized using particle swarm optimization (PSO). However, not all of the
model parameters were uniquely identiﬁable, given the training data. Instead, we estimated an
ensemble of likely parameter sets (N = 20) from eight in vitro time-series coagulation data sets
with and without the protein C pathway. Ensemble approaches have been used previously for other
signal transduction models [43–47], and for metabolic models [48] to estimate the impact of poorly
constrained parameter values or poorly understood network structure on simulation performance.
Thus, ensemble approaches are common in the dynamic modeling community. However, a unique
feature of the current study is the direct connection between our particle swarm approach, and the
parameter ensemble; each particle in our swarm uniquely corresponded to a parameter set in our
ensemble. Thus, by constraining particles to operate in different parameter regions, giving each

163
particle a different parameter combination to explore, or perhaps even suppling a different model
formulation to each particle we can effectively traverse through complex parameter and model spaces.
We validated the ensemble using thrombin data sets taken from multiple laboratories for a variety of
experimental conditions not used during training. The ensemble predicted thrombin trajectories for
conditions not used for model training, including thrombin generation for normal and hemophilic
coagulation in the presence of platelets (a signiﬁcant unmodeled component). We then used ﬂux
analysis to understand how the network operated in a variety of conditions, and global sensitivity
analysis to identify which parameters controlled the performance of the network. Flux analysis
showed the logical rules formulation encoded the transitions between initiation, ampliﬁcation and
termination of thrombin generation. Sensitivity analysis suggested that the ampliﬁcation rate constant
was more important to the time to peak thrombin, while the ATIII inhibition constant controlled
thrombin exposure. Taken together, the proposed hybrid framework produced a surprisingly
predictive model, suggesting this approach could be used to effectively model other biochemical
networks important to human health.
Malfunctions in coagulation can have potentially fatal consequences. Aggressive clotting
involved with Coronary Artery Diseases (CADs), collectively accounts for 38% of all deaths in North
America [49]. Coagulation management during surgery can also be challenging, particularly with the
increase in clinical use of antithrombotic drugs [50]. Insufﬁcient coagulation due to genetic disorders
such as hemophilia can also result in recurrent bleeding. The coagulation factors VIII (fVIII) and IX
(fIX) are deﬁcient in Hemophilia A and B, respectively [51–53]. People with mild hemophilia have
5%–40% of the normal clotting factor levels while severe hemophiliacs have <1% [53]. Hemophilia
can be controlled with regular infusions of the deﬁcient clotting factors. However, clotting factor
replacement sometimes leads to the formation of fVIII and fIX inhibitors in vivo [54]. Alternatively,
recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) has been used to treat bleeding disorders [55,56] including
hemophilia with and without factor VIII/IX inhibitors [57]. However, rFVIIa requires frequent
administration (every 2–3 h), and many questions remain about its mechanism of action, its effective
dosage [54], and its overall utility for the treatment trauma-associated hemorrhage [58]. In this
study, we did not model rFVIIa-induced coagulation directly. Rather, we modeled a general trigger
which initiated the extrinsic coagulation cascade. Since we identiﬁed the model using TF/FVIIa,
inherent to our rFVIIa simulations (and the rate constant governing initiation) was the presence of TF.
However, even with this complication, the model generated potentially useful insight into the rFVIIa
mechanism of action, and its possible shortcomings especially for the treatment of hemophilia.
The addition of rFVIIa directly activated thrombin through the initiation pathway. However, no
ampliﬁcation of the thrombin signal occurred without fVIII or fIX. Thus, the peak thrombin signal
was lower than normal coagulation, the peak thrombin time was longer, and thrombin generation was
eventually inhibited by the combined action of ATIII and the protein C pathway. However, as the dose
of rFVIIa increased, the peak thrombin time decreased (eventually saturating around 200×nominal
trigger), and the peak thrombin value increased such that the thrombin proﬁle resembled normal
coagulation. Butenas et al. performed an extensive in vitro study of rFVIIa-induced thrombin
generation under normal and hemophilic conditions [59]. They found qualitatively similar trends,

164
namely rFVIIa restored normal coagulation (even in the absence of TF) for large enough rFVIIa
doses, although rFVIIa-induced coagulation in hemophilia (even for large rFVIIa doses) lagged
the normal proﬁle. These results suggest that rFVIIa administration alone might not be able to
initiate normal coagulation in recurrent bleeding, unless the dosage is well above a critical threshold.
However, deﬁning this threshold, which is likely patient speciﬁc, is difﬁcult as there is tremendous
patient to patient variability even with a normal coagulation phenotype [60].
The hybrid model simulations of thrombin formation were qualitatively similar to other published
coagulation models. Many mathematical models of coagulation dynamics have been built upon the
Hockin-Mann model [26]. For example, Brummel-Ziedins and co-workers incorporated the Protein
C (PC) pathway into the original Hockin-Mann network to investigate thrombin generation in cases of
familial PC deﬁciency [61]. Simulations using this model showed that PC mutations caused elevated
thrombin levels without changing the initiation time or the slope of thrombin generation. This
trend was qualitatively captured by our reduced order model. For example, we showed decreased
peak thrombin concentration in the presence of PC pathway and similar thrombin generation slopes,
although the initiation time was different as these were different experimental trials. Danforth et al.
simulated normal thrombin generation using 5 pM tissue factor with all other factors at their mean
physiological level [60]. The initiation time in this simulation was approximately 4.4 min. When
predicting the normal thrombin generation curve using 0.2 nM of TF/FVIIa, we showed an initiation
time between 4–5 min in a platelet based system, and an initiation time of 3–4 min in a PCPS system
with 5 pM TF/FVIIa, although these times were largely dictated by the time delay parameter TD.
Thus, while were not able to explicitly predict initiation time, we did bracket the initiation time
predicted by the Danforth study. Mitrophanov et al. showed, in a study exploring the mode of
action of rfVIIa [62], that increasing amounts of rFVIIa accelerated the maximal slope of thrombin
generation, and both the peak thrombin and initiation times. While we failed to capture the effect of
rFVIIa on initiation time, we correctly predicted that changes in the rFVIIa concentration affected the
maximal thrombin slope and the propagation phase. Lastly, detailed mechanistic coagulation models,
for example the model by Luan and co-workers [24] or the recent model by Mitrophanov et al. [30],
often contain hundreds of proteins and interactions. Thus, it is unlikely that the reduced order hybrid
model will replicate all the rich behavior of these other models. However, for qualitatively different
cases such as normal versus hemophilia, the hybrid approach gave similar results. For example, akin
to the hybrid model, Luan et al. modeled the normal and hemophilia data from Allen [42]. However,
unlike the previous Luan et al. study, we used this data for validation rather than training. Hybrid
model simulations of the Allen et al. data set were surprisingly consistent with the Luan et al. model.
For example, the ampliﬁcation of a normal thrombin signal were comparable, and in hemophilia both
correctly predicted decreased thrombin ampliﬁcation. Taken together, the hybrid model performance
was similar to other full scale mechanistic models in the literature, although we consistently failed to
predict initiation times across data sets.
The performance of the proof of principle coagulation model was impressive given its limited
size. However, there are several issues that could be further explored. First, the prediction of
initiation time should be investigated. We were able to estimate initiation time within a data set,

165
but unable to predict initiation time across independent data sets. This suggested that we should
update the initiation module to distinguish between different triggers, e.g., TF/FVIIa versus rFVIIa
alone, and to include key biological milestones such as FXa activation (a prerequisite to thrombin
formation). Next, there are several additional biological modules that could be added to the core
model presented here. First, we could include thrombin-induced platelet activation and the role
of activated platelets in ampliﬁcation. We captured thrombin generation data in the presence of
platelets, however, the initial shape of the activation curve and the time-scale of activation was not
always consistent with the data. Platelets are activated by thrombin through the cleavage of the
extracellular domain of protease-activated receptors (PARs) on the platelet surface. Once activated,
platelets play an important role in ampliﬁcation, and are key mediators of the positive feedback
driving ampliﬁcation. Thus, this biology is a potentially important component of an expanded
model. We should also add the intrinsic pathway to the model. The intrinsic pathway is triggered
by contact activation of the plasma protease factor XI (fXI) by negatively charged surfaces and
by thrombin and upstream factors such as activated plasma protease factor XII (FXIIa) [63,64].
Activated platelets may also release polyphosphate which directly activates fXII [65]. Arguably a
minor player in acute bleeding, contact activation could also be important in other wound healing
contexts. Finally, to make the model more clinically relevant, we should include the biochemical
processes responsible for clot formation and clot dissolution (ﬁbrinolysis). Clot formation is driven
by thrombin activity, while ﬁbrinolysis is driven by plasmin activity, a key enzyme that cleaves ﬁbrin
(one of the main materials in a clot). Similar to coagulation, ﬁbrinolysis is managed by several
activating and inhibitory factors which control the balance between clot formation and dissolution.
Tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and urokinase activate plasmin, along with contact pathway
factors such as fXIa. On the other hand, thrombin activatable ﬁbrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) inhibits
the degradation of ﬁbrin by plasmin. Also, similar to coagulation, there is considerable ﬁbrinolysis
and contact pathway data sets that can be used to train the model. Lastly, the choice of max/min
integration rules or the particular form of the transfer functions could be generalized to include other
rule types and functions. Theoretically, an integration rule is a function whose domain is a set of
transfer function inputs, and whose range is v ∈ [0, 1]. Thus, integration rules other than max/min
could be used, such as the mean or the product, assuming the range of the transfer functions is always
f ∈ [0, 1]. Alternative integration rules such as the mean might have different properties which
could inﬂuence model identiﬁcation or performance. For example, a mean integration rule would
be differentiable, which allows derivative-based optimization approaches to be used. The particular
form of the transfer function could also be explored. We choose a Hill-like function because of
its prominence in the systems and synthetic biology community. However, the only mathematical
requirement for a transfer function is that it map a non-negative continuous or categorical variable
into the range f ∈ [0, 1]. Thus, many types of transfer functions are possible.

4. Materials and Methods
4.1. Formulation and Solution of the Model Equations
We used ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to model the time evolution of proteins (xi ) in
our reduced order coagulation model:
dxi 
=
σij rj (x, , k)
dt
j=1
R

i = 1, 2, . . . , M

(1)

where R denotes the number of reactions, M denotes the number of protein species in the model.
The quantity rj (x, , k) denotes the rate of reaction j. Typically, reaction j is a non-linear function
of biochemical species abundance, as well as unknown kinetic parameters k (K × 1). The quantity
σij denotes the stoichiometric coefﬁcient for species i in reaction j. If σij > 0, species i is produced
by reaction j. Conversely, if σij < 0, species i is consumed by reaction j, while σij = 0 indicates
species i is not connected with reaction j. The system material balances were subject to the initial
conditions x (to ) = xo , which were speciﬁed by the experimental setup.
Each reaction rate was written as the product of two terms, a kinetic term (r̄j ) and a control term
(vj ) that could depend upon many regulatory transfer functions:
rj (x, , k) = r̄j vj

(2)

We used multiple saturation kinetics to model the reaction term r̄j :
⎛
⎞
⎜
r̄j = kjmax i ⎝
s∈m−
j

xs
⎟
⎠
Kjs + xs

(3)

where kjmax denotes the maximum rate for reaction j, i denotes the enzyme abundance which catalyzes reaction j, and Kjs denotes the saturation constant for species s in reaction j. The product in
Equation (3) was carried out over the set of reactants for reaction j (denoted as m−
j ). The control
term vj depended upon the combination of factors which inﬂuenced the activity of enzyme i. For
each enzyme, we used a rule-based approach to select from competing control factors (Figure 2). If
an enzyme was activated by m metabolites, we modeled this activation as:
vj = max (f1j (Z) , . . . , fmj (Z))

(4)

where 0 ≤ fij (Z) ≤ 1 was a regulatory transfer function that calculated the inﬂuence of metabolite
i on the activity of enzyme j. Conversely, if enzyme activity was inhibited by m metabolites, we
modeled this inhibition as:
vj = 1 − max (f1j (Z) , . . . , fmj (Z))

(5)

Lastly, if an enzyme had both m activating and n inhibitory factors, we modeled the control
term as:
(6)
vj = min (uj , dj )

167
where:
(f1j (Z) , . . . , fmj (Z))
uj = max
+

(7)

dj = 1 − max
(f1j (Z) , . . . , fnj (Z))
−

(8)

j

j

The quantities j + and j − denoted the sets of activating and inhibitory factors for enzyme j. If
a process has no modifying factors, we set vj = 1. There are many possible functional forms for
0 ≤ fij (Z) ≤ 1. However, in this study, each individual regulatory transfer function took the form:
fi (Zj , kij ) =

kijη Zjη
1 + kijη Zjη

(9)

where Zj denotes the abundance of the j factor (e.g., metabolite abundance), and kij and η are control
parameters. kij was the species gain parameter, while η was a cooperativity parameter (similar to a
Hill coefﬁcient). Applying the general framework to the reduced coagulation network resulted in ﬁve
ordinary differential equations:

(13)

(14)

where x = (f II, F IIa, P C, AP C, AT III)T . The terms r∗ v∗ in the balance equations denote
corrected kinetic expressions for initiation, ampliﬁcation and inhibition processes. The rate of
initiation r̄init was modeled as:
x1
(15)
r̄init = kinit (trigger)
Kinit,f II + x1
where kinit , Kinit,f II are the rate and saturation constants governing initiation, respectively. The rate
of initiation was modiﬁed by vinit , the control parameter governing initiation. Initiation was sensitive
to the level of trigger (activator) and TFPI (inhibitor):
 −

+
(T F P I) , finit

(16)
vinit = min finit
where the transfer functions f took the form of Equation (9). The rate of thrombin ampliﬁcation was
given by:
x1
(17)
r̄amp = kamp (x2 )
Kamp,f II + x1
where kamp , Kamp,f II denote the rate and saturation constants governing ampliﬁcation, respectively.
The ampliﬁcation control term, which modiﬁed ampliﬁcation rate, was modeled as a combination of
multiple inhibition terms and one activation term:
 −

−
+
(T F P I) , famp
(x4 ) , famp
(Zamp )
(18)
vamp = min famp

168
+
where Zamp = f V ×f X ×f V III ×f IX. Although famp
(Zamp ) is an activating term, we included it
in the min integration rule; the factors in Zamp were essential for ampliﬁcation (if any of these factors
was missing the ampliﬁcation reaction would not occur). Thus, the factors in Zamp were required
components, a classiﬁcation that we implemented by the min selection rule. The rate activated protein
C formation was given by:

r̄apc = kAP C,f ormation (T M )

x3
Kf ormation,P C + x3

(19)

where kAP C,f ormation and Kf ormation,P C denote the rate and saturation constants governing activated
protein C formation, respectively and T M denotes the thrombomodulin abundance. We modeled the
control term which governed APC formation as a single thrombin-dependent activation term:
 +

(x2 )
(20)
vapc = max fapc
Lastly, we included direct irreversible inhibition of FIIa by ATIII:
r̄inh,AT III = kAT III,inhibition (x5 xγ2 )

(21)

where γ was estimated to be γ = 1.26. For ATIII inhibition of FIIa, the control variables vinh,AT III
was taken to be unity. The model equations were encoded using the Python programming language
and solved using the ODEINT routine of the SciPy module [66]. The model ﬁles can be downloaded
from http://www.varnerlab.org.
4.2. Estimation of Model Parameters From Experimental Data
Model parameters were estimated by minimizing the difference between simulations and
experimental thrombin measurements (squared residual):
2
T 
S 

x̂j (τ ) − xj (τ, k)
(22)
min
k
ωj (τ )
τ =1 j=1
where x̂j (τ ) denotes the measured value of species j at time τ , xj (τ, k) denotes the simulated value
for species j at time τ , and ωj (τ ) denotes the experimental measurement variance for species j at
time τ . The outer summation is with respect to time, while the inner summation is with respect to
state. We minimized the model residual using Particle swarm optimization (PSO) [67]. PSO uses
a swarming metaheuristic to explore parameter spaces. A strength of PSO is its ability to ﬁnd the
global minimum, even in the presence of potentially many local minima, by communicating the local
error landscape experienced by each particle collectively to the swarm. Thus, PSO acts both as a
local and a global search algorithm. For each iteration, particles in the swarm compute their local
error by evaluating the model equations using their speciﬁc parameter vector realization. From each
of these local points, a globally best error is identiﬁed. Both the local and global error are then used
to update the parameter estimates of each particle using the rules:
Δi = θ1 Δi + θ2 r1 (Li − ki ) + θ3 r2 (G − ki )
k i = k i + Δi

where (θ1 , θ2 , θ3 ) are adjustable parameters, Li denotes the local best solution found by particle i, and
G denotes the best solution found over the entire population of particles. The quantities r1 and r2 denote uniform random vectors with the same dimension as the number of unknown model parameters
(K × 1). In thus study, we used (θ1 , θ2 , θ3 ) = (1.0, 0.05564, 0.02886). The quality of parameter
estimates was measured using goodness of ﬁt (model residual). The particle swarm optimization
routine was implemented in the Python programming language. All plots were made using the
Matplotlib module of Python [68].
4.3. Global Sensitivity Analysis of Model Performance
We conducted a global sensitivity analysis, using the variance-based method of Sobol, to estimate
which parameters controlled the performance of the reduced order model [69]. We computed the total
sensitivity index of each parameter relative to two performance objectives, the peak thrombin time
and the area under the thrombin curve (thrombin exposure). We established the sampling bounds
for each parameter from the minimum and maximum value of that parameter in the parameter set
ensemble. We used the sampling method of Saltelli et al. [70] to compute a family of N (2d + 2)
parameter sets which obeyed our parameter ranges, where N was the number of trials, and d was
the number of parameters in the model. In our case, N = 10,000 and d = 22, so the total sensitivity
indices were computed from 460,000 model evaluations. The variance-based sensitivity analysis was
conducted using the SALib module encoded in the Python programming language [71].

A Quantitative Systems Pharmacology Perspective on
Cancer Immunology
Christina Byrne-Hoffman and David J. Klinke II
Abstract: The return on investment within the pharmaceutical industry has exhibited an
exponential decline over the last several decades. Contemporary analysis suggests that the rate-limiting
step associated with the drug discovery and development process is our limited understanding of
the disease pathophysiology in humans that is targeted by a drug. Similar to other industries,
mechanistic modeling and simulation has been proposed as an enabling quantitative tool to help
address this problem. Moreover, immunotherapies are transforming the clinical treatment of cure
cancer and are becoming a major segment of the pharmaceutical research and development
pipeline. As the clinical benefit of these immunotherapies seems to be limited to subset of the
patient population, identifying the specific defect in the complex network of interactions associated
with host immunity to a malignancy is a major challenge for expanding the clinical benefit.
Understanding the interaction between malignant and immune cells is inherently a systems problem,
where an engineering perspective may be helpful. The objective of this manuscript is to summarize
this quantitative systems perspective, particularly with respect to developing immunotherapies for the
treatment of cancer.

1. Introduction
Motivated by a desire to improve human health, the pharmaceutical industry leverages
biological discoveries to develop drugs that aim to restore health at significant financial investment.
Overall the costs associated with pharmaceutical research and development, as represented by the
US share of the market, has been increasing exponentially. The current estimate to bring a new
medical entity to market requires upwards of approximately a $1–2.5 billion investment in research
and development [1,2]. To recoup these financial investments, pharmaceutical companies are
provided with protection from competition for a limited time by patenting their inventions.
However, the estimated return on investment by the pharmaceutical industry has been experiencing
an exponential decline in the last several decades. This trend, sometimes referred to as the
innovation gap, presents a challenge for economic sustainability of the current model for
innovation within the pharmaceutical industry.
The cost of pharmaceutical development escalates as drugs progress further from bench to
market. In particular, Phase II clinical trials have become a key pinch point in the research and
development pipeline, as it combines both significant risk and cost. This phase is the first time the
efficacy of the drug is tested in real patients within the target disease and therefore has the highest
probability of failure. It is also one of the phases with the highest out-of-pocket cost for the
developer and other stakeholders [3]. Clinical trials are predicated largely on positive pre-clinical

176
studies using animal models of disease. Unfortunately, animal modeling, which presents lower
financial and human health hazards, may not always recreate the specific molecular and cellular
networks associated with the pathophysiology and adverse reactions in human subjects [4].
Therefore, to lessen the costs of development and risk to humans in clinical trials, it is important to
use appropriate models of the disease to maximize efficacy, safety, and benefit to patients.
In the last 50 years, computer-aided modeling and simulation has transformed a variety of
industries, including financial portfolio management and the aerospace industry. Modeling and
simulation in the financial sector has enabled real-time evaluation of economic performance
measures using a mathematical model of the particular business sector to predict future
performance and to optimize financial return [5]. In the aerospace industry, modeling and
simulation is used to design new airframes, which eliminates the need for multiple physical
prototypes constructed at intermediate points during design and reduces the time from concept to
production [6]. In both cases, mathematical modeling and simulation provide a quantitative
framework to capture our conceptual understanding of the modeled process and interpret
heterogeneous data acquired from the process. These two examples also represent extremes of our
conceptual understanding. Financial markets are complex systems that are influenced by a variety
of observed and unobserved factors. Assuming that the underlying structure of the market is not
changing, future behavior can be predicted using empirical mathematical models that are
constructed using historical data. At the opposite end of the spectrum, computer-aided design of
airframes captures physical principles such as the conservation of mass, which implies two physical
objects cannot occupy the same space, and the governing physics associated with the performance
objectives of the airframe. Similar to these industries, mathematical modeling and simulation has
been proposed as approach to improve our understanding of the biological mechanisms targeted by
a particular therapy [7]. This could help predict the outcomes of human clinical trials and, thereby,
help bridge the innovation gap between cell and animal models and human pathophysiology,
while also providing a cost savings in development, as computationally “expensive” modeling is
inherently more cost effective than additional physical and biological models of disease [8]. In a
2011 National Institutes of Health White Paper, recommendations for quantitative systems
pharmacology using quantitative experimental studies and model-based computational analyses
that also incorporate clinical “omics data” were given in hopes of addressing clinical Phase II study
failures in drug development and physiological, chemical, and biological disconnects in preclinical
research [9].
Given the oncology slice of pharmaceutical research and development and the recent shift
towards immunotherapies for cancer, the objective of this review is to summarize how modeling
and simulation has aided in the understanding of biological changes associated with oncogenesis as
it relates to immunity. In subsequent paragraphs, we provide a brief overview of the cancer and
immune systems, tumor somatic and clonal evolution properties, and how cancer cell heterogeneity
complicates therapeutic aims. We will also discuss recent immunotherapeutic advancements and
the computational models used to describe the interactions between cancer and the immune system.

177
2. Emerging View of Cancer as a System
Oncogenesis is attributed to the accumulation of genetic mutations that lead to uncontrolled cell
growth and proliferation. These mutations alter function of the modified gene through
overexpression of the corresponding protein or rearrangement of a gene to create an entirely new
protein that has dysregulated activity [10]. Mutations in specific genes that can, in isolation,
transform a normal cell into a malignant cell are called oncogenes. Cancer drug development over
the past several decades has been focused on targeting these oncogene mutations by inhibiting the
function of corresponding proteins using small molecule drugs [11]. Researchers have scrutinized
the altered signaling pathways in malignant cells in hopes of finding the key protein conserved in
oncogenesis and metastasis but that plays minimal role in normal cells [12]. However, these drugs
are rarely as efficacious in the clinic, where de novo and emergent drug resistance is common [13].
The small molecule inhibitor segment of the pharmaceutical industry is also associated with a
view of cancer as a disease driven by malignant alterations that are intrinsic to or driven by the
cancer cell [14,15]. This view can be represented by the six hallmarks of cancer discussed by
Hanahan and Weinberg 2000 [16]. The six hallmarks summarize how genetic alterations change
how a malignant cell senses and responds to extracellular signals in ways detrimental to the host.
Assuming cancer is driven by the autonomous actions of malignant cells, the in vitro study of a cell
line can be an appropriate model for identifying new therapeutic leads. This idea underpins using a
collection of cell lines as a way to screen drugs that inhibit cell proliferation of exhibit cytotoxic
activity in a high-throughput manner, such as the NCI-60 [17–20].
Previously to recent breakthroughs in immunotherapy, small molecule inhibitors were standard
of care for many non-resectable metastatic diseases. B-Raf, a Raf kinase member of the MAP
Kinase/ERK signaling pathway and involved in cell growth and proliferation, is a commonly
mutated gene in many human cancers, such as metastatic melanoma. Vemurafenib and Dabrafenib
are two FDA-approved B-Raf inhibitors used in the clinic that targets cancer with the B-RAF
V600E (valine at amino acid position 600 to glutamic acid) mutation. However, cancer cells
without the V600E B-Raf mutation may proliferate more in response to the vemurafenib drug [21].
Additionally, most metastatic melanoma patients become chemoresistant to both of these B-Raf
inhibitors within 6 to 7 months of treatment. Therefore, combination therapies, such as vemurafenib
with MEK-inhibitors like FDA-approved trametinib, are preferred to overcome the resistance
mechanism in advanced melanoma, and may extend progression-free survival in patients by an
average of about 3 months [22]. However, resistance will eventually reoccur and the patient will
fatally relapse.

178
More recently, cancer research has expanded to include factors external to the malignant cell
that contribute to oncogenesis. In 2011, Hanahan and Weinberg updated the hallmarks to include
four new “emerging hallmarks and enabling characteristics”, which focus on changes associated
with the malignancy that alter interactions among cells of the host [23]. The immune system was
identified as having an influential role on tumor progression, and changes in metabolism and
inflammation in the tumor microenvironment and throughout the body are known to have an effect
on clinical outcomes, as well. This shift in perspective represents a malignancy as part of an
integrated but dysfunctional system, rather than as an isolated mass of malignant clones. By
incorporating the emerging hallmarks into the collective understanding of carcinogenesis, the
ability of a malignant cell to manipulate its local environment and the immune system that it
interacts with are being recognized as integral to tumor development and support the description of
cancer as an evolutionary process (Figure 1). The ability of a malignant cell to maintain the tumor
microenvironment hinges on dysfunctional intercellular communication [24,25].
A tumor is comprised of a variety of cell types, including a heterogeneous collection of
malignant clones, various stromal cells that provide nutrients and facilitate remodeling of the
extracellular matrix, and immune cells. Heterogeneity among malignant clones can exist within
various morphologies or cellular phenotypes, producing cells originating from a similar origin, but
may yet exhibit various structural, gene expression, signaling network, proliferative, metabolic, and
metastatic differences (Figure 1). The existence of heterogeneity is a key element of evolutionary
process. Somatic evolution is thought to change the dynamics of tissues [26,27], while evolutionary
processes also maintains their own dynamics [28], both of which can influence development of
heterogeneity within a particular cellular population. Resolving the issues surrounding multiple
dynamics of biological systems and the influence of the immune and other cellular systems on
tumors is technically difficult to replicate, particularly in in vitro models of cancer. The dynamics
of cell communication can also influence the hallmarks of cancer of a potential malignancy and
emerging hallmarks can alter the fitness, adaptive, or phenotypic landscapes [29–31]. Timing of
response to signaling, especially that of the immune system, can mean the difference between
malignancy proliferation and tumor eradication [32].
As part of the evolutionary process, recognizing the heterogeneity of the environment is crucial
to understanding how alterations in cell signaling and immune response may promote tumors.
Cancer cell heterogeneity within some tumors is linked to epigenetic differences in tumor cell
genomes, perhaps from variances in cancer stem cells, while other examples of divergence from a
single phenotype can be accounted for through clonal evolution, or even a combination of the two
models of tumor propagation [33,34]. Therefore, we see that clonal evolution and heterogeneity are
directly proportional to one another and will determine impact of immunological eradication or
pharmaceutical treatment of the tumor. The remainder of this section will discuss models of
somatic and clonal evolution and influence of heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment on
metastatic progression from a systemic perspective of cancer.

integrated into the circulatory system, as represented by including blood vessels and
fibroblasts, as seen in Hanahan and Weinberg 2000; (C) The tumor microenvironment
becomes more complex. In addition to blood vessels and fibroblasts, immune cell types
of various kinds are introduced into the system, as seen in Hanahan and Weinberg
2011; (D) The emerging view of a malignancy as a heterogeneous and dynamic system.
Not only are blood vessels, fibroblasts, and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,
but there are distinct clonal populations of cancer cells intermingled with a variety of
different immune cells and other cell types.
2.1. Somatic Evolution
Somatic evolution, as distinct from classical Darwinian evolution, is a driving force for
carcinogenesis [35]. The majority of somatic mutations within the genome are neutral, but
accumulations of even non-deleterious mutations can alter the fitness landscape of an organism via
genetic drift [36,37]. Changes in the fitness landscape include alterations in cellular communication [38],
such as upregulation or downregulation of receptors, intermediate players, or downstream products,
alterations in pathway activity, or mutations in pathway protein partners. This can promote
selection of advantageous clones [39]. More importantly, these malignant clones can change the
fitness landscape in such a way that the local microenvironments become a favorable niche for
malignant cells. A particular case of somatic evolution is clonal evolution, which considers how the

180
environment influences the selection of pre-existing clones within a heterogeneous population and
neglects the influence of mutagens to further diversify the clonal population. Somatic and clonal
evolution may provide many benefits to a cell. Changes in the environment of the cell may force it
down a particular path, providing a fitness advantage for growth and proliferation. While most of
these particular mutations may provide benefit for survival of the host, these alterations can
promote further genomic instability, leading to tumorigenesis.
Reductionist theories and experimentation usually examines one input and one output of a
particular system, and therefore may be inadequate in describing cell processes with appropriate
models, especially in relation to somatic and clonal evolution within a population. A cell is eversensing of its microenvironment, ready to respond to relevant extracellular signals present in its
vicinity, whether the cues are coming from other cell types, other tissues, or from itself. These cues
can also have a profound impact on the evolution of a cellular population, depending on duration,
strength, and ability of the cell machinery to respond to the signal. This communication may come
in the form of a soluble ligand or direct cell contact and provide positive or negative feedback
to the cell.
As a heterogeneous environment, a variety of signals are occurring and being processed by the
target cell at any time and are difficult to observe with traditional models. Various factors, driven
by cellular communication, can affect the fitness of a particular population of tumor cells, such as
availability of nutritional or metabolic resources, presence and strength of immune system
influences, and ability of the cell to interact with the extracellular matrix. To combat this hurdle,
development of a hybrid-discrete continuum (HDC) model to examine tumor morphology and
metastatic potential was developed by Anderson et al. [40], which leverages the impact of multiple
factors of the tumor microenvironment on somatic or clonal evolution. This mathematical model
allows for “random” influence of particular set of variables, while retaining deterministic properties
of known inputs with known outputs.
Related to factors surrounding use of the HDC computational model is the “clonal dominance
theory” developed by Kerbel and colleagues. While clonal dominance was easily observed in vivo
in mammary tumors, replication under ideal growth conditions was difficult. The group examined
the growth of two subpopulations, non-metastatic SP1 and metastatic variant C1, of cells under
both ideal and non-optimal growth conditions. Under optimal conditions, both subpopulations of
cells grew at the same rate, while under the “stressed” conditions, emergence of the “dominant”
metastatic subpopulation C1 became evident. In addition, transforming growth factor-beta (TGFȕ)
and extracellular matrix-driven cell-to-cell communication between the two subpopulations was
indicated as being required for assistance of the dominant metastatic subpopulation to maximum
capacity [41]. This study highlighted the importance of culture conditions and physiological
dimensions, such as serum concentration and spheroid growth, for in vitro work to best replicate in
vivo tumors, given the importance of cell-to-cell communication in tumor development and
maintenance. However, researchers often overlook the effect of these conditions on clonal
evolution, and therefore, how these conditions may affect whether a certain model is appropriate
for judging efficacy of a treatment in in vitro or in vivo experiments.

181
Other features that impact clonal dominance in the evolution of cancer include consideration of
compartment size. All tissues can be viewed as “compartments”. Clonal expansion readily occurs
within these compartments and can be restricted by neighboring clones [42]. As shown by
Michor et al. in a mathematical modeling study, clonal expansion within a small compartment is
driven by genetic drift and is quickly dominated by a certain genetically unstable subpopulation.
However, the expansion is readily limited by boundaries of the compartment and is therefore likely
to be contained. Conversely, large compartments will contain a variety of subpopulations, some
tumorigenic; however, the effect of clonal expansion is diluted unless both alleles of a particular
gene are affected, or selective advantage favors the tumorigenic subpopulation [43]. Once a
tumorigenic subpopulation has taken over the compartment, success of the neoplasm and resulting
metastasis is a more probable scenario. This highlights the importance of cell-communication
through cell-to-cell contact and local regulation of homeostasis in limiting genomic instability.
Experimental cell models may reflect these effects, and therefore cellular confluency in vitro, or
tumor transplant location in vivo may affect treatment outcomes.
Driver mutations and passenger mutations are another area of investigation in regards to
computational models of the evolution of cancer. Driver mutations result in functional or
morphological differences of cells, while passenger mutations are a neutral consequence of the
evolutionary process [44]. In a meta-analysis study of lung and ovarian cancer, Youn and Simon
found that metastasis as a result of cancer evolution was related to the age of the tumor and number
of cell generations. The difference in metastatic potential as a function of generation or age of the
tumor was related to the ability of the parental lineage to self-renew. For example, more
generations were required for ovarian cancer to metastasize versus the lung cancer cell, which
self-renews more gradually. The study was conducted by using passenger mutations, which do not
confer a selective growth advantage in clonal expansion of the tumor, to estimate when the driver
mutation, developed in the early stages of tumorigenesis and linked to causation of the tumor, had
occurred and therefore, the approximate generational age of the tumor [45]. This study highlights
the tumor progression differences in cell line or cancer types are largely attributed to clonal
differences and how this may have an effect on treatment outcomes, not only in cell and animal model
experiments, but also in the clinic.
2.2. Heterogeneity of the Tumor Microenvironment
We have examined the effects of clonal expansion in tumorigenesis and how compartment size
and tissue dynamics may affect this process. Clonal expansion implies a somewhat homogenous
subpopulation of cells dominates a certain microenvironment, compartment, or tissue. However, the
heterogeneity of tumor microenvironments and tissues is well described [46]. Not only does the
tumor stroma contain different cell types, such as immune cells, and structural support cells, but
tumor cells themselves are part of a heterogeneous population. Different subpopulations of various
clones exist, each expressing a variety of biomarkers and each clone with their own signaling
dynamics, within the total tumor cell population.
Analysis of National Cancer Institute (NCI) and National Human Genome Research Institute
(NHGRI) TCGA (the Cancer Genome Atlas) Project has revealed that sequencing of human tumors

182
has provided a wealth of genomic information. The goal of this project was to determine common
genetic alterations in various cancer types and subtypes, and use this information to improve
clinical outcomes and tailor therapies to individuals. However, the impact of this data on improving
clinical outcomes or identifying successful drug targets within corresponding patient groups
remains limited. While the TCGA project was conceptually born out of the oncogene perspective,
recognizing that tumors contain a variety of heterogeneous tumor clonal populations and
prevalence within these clonal subsets of varying abundance could have a profound impact on the
information gathered and possibly skew data interpretation [12]. Molecular-targeted therapies
focusing on one set of genetic alterations would have little effect on a subpopulation expressing an
entirely different set of alterations, as seen within the heterogeneous tumor. This may be one reason
combination therapies have been so effective in treating certain types of cancer, as seen with the
synergistic effect of p53 vaccines and chemotherapy in an evolutionary double bind study
conducted by Anderson and colleagues [47].
As discussed previously, clonal evolution plays a critical role in the development of a tumor, but
tumor heterogeneity may be a critical aspect for tumor persistence. Different tumor clonal
populations may allow for evasion of the immune system. If tumor antigens produced vary from
cell to cell within the tumor, a targeted immune system response will become diluted, allowing
immunoescape of the tumor. This type of clonal selection provides for a phenomenon described as
immunoselective pressure. By allowing for targeted killing of a specific tumor cell population
expressing a given antigen, other tumor cell populations may be able to fill the tumor niche,
especially cell populations that do not express an immunogenic antigen. Tumor cells sensitive to
the inflammatory response, generalized apoptosis signals, or other factors in the microenvironment,
may also be eliminated, while more resistant cells are allowed to proliferate. Additionally,
cytokines may provide selective pressure to develop mutations that result in clones that are able to
overcome these immune signals targeting the cells for destruction [48]. This phenomenon is called
immunoediting. A deadly combination of elimination of immune-sensitive tumor cells, equilibrium
of tumor cells that have survived elimination, and escape of resistant clones limits tumor
eradication by the immune system [49].
Clonal heterogeneity can also provide survival advantages depending on the location of the
clonal subset within the tumor microenvironment. Mutations that promote angiogenesis, for
example, would provide a survival advantage in a tumor region not within immediate contact of the
vasculature and perfusion of blood and nutrient resources. Alternatively, mutations that upregulate
multidrug resistance transporters would provide a survival advantage in areas of the tumor that is
most susceptible to contact with chemotherapeutic agents, such as in the periphery of the tumor that
is most accessible to drug delivery. To explore this relationship between tumor heterogeneity and
persistence, a computational study by Michor and colleagues examined the effect of immune
system response and chemotherapeutic interventions in tumor escape [50]. They developed a
mathematical model to describe original tumor cell and variant tumor cell fitness and number,
mutation rate of the cancer cells, competition between variants, tumor cell elimination rate,
interactions between tumor cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), and the proliferation and
decay of CTLs. They found that the more variants that exist within a tumor, the more likely the

183
tumor will catastrophically or partially escape from immune system or chemotherapy attack.
However, a certain level of homeostasis in variation must be maintained to support a functional
genome for survival of the tumor.
In summary, a tumor is not only heterogeneous in its various clonal populations and expression
of various tumor antigens, but is also heterogeneous in terms of weaknesses. By directing therapy
at several weaknesses at once, instead of one at a time, or by targeting the interplay between tumor
and other systems it interacts with, this lessens the probability of a certain clonal population
gaining proliferative momentum in the tumor niche. Tumor heterogeneity is extremely important
for the success of a tumor cell in the microenvironment and relies on the dynamics between the
immune system, rates of genetic alterations, and sensitivity of variants to chemotherapeutic or
immune system attack.
3. The Re-Emergence of Cancer Immunotherapy
The immune system has long been suspected as influential on cancer development. In the early
1890s, Dr. William Coley noticed a reduction in tumor size of patients with bacterial infections. He
began injecting live bacteria into the tumors, and later developed a safer concoction, termed
“Coley’s toxins”, with mixed results [51]. Over time, the field shifted away from cancer
immunology research, as cytokines and immune cell types became well defined, yet cancer treatment
with interleukins and other cytokines yielded variable results. Interleukin-2 showed efficacy in
treating metastatic melanoma. However, its adverse side effects, inefficacy in large tumors, and
high rates of toxicity such as allergic reactions and seizures discouraged widespread use in
patients [52–55]. Interleukin-12 was also investigated as a cancer drug for its robust
anti-angiogenic and immune cell-promoting activity. Although it had shown promise in preclinical
trials, a patient death in a study designed to test safety diminished enthusiasm to pursue systemic
delivery of IL-12 as a potential therapeutic [56,57].
Most of the failures of immune cell-promoting cytokines to eradicate tumors in patients could be
attributed to inappropriate animal models and the lack of target specificity of these
immunotherapeutic agents, as seen with the inability of cytokines to possess the sensitivity and
specificity to function as appropriate biomarkers [58]. In an effort to gain specificity, antibodies,
such as Rituximab, were developed and approved for the treatment of cancer [59]. This
development of antibodies to target cancer has continued to this day, with the break-through of
ipilimumab in metastatic melanoma [60]. Through this process of repeated success and failures, the
view of cancer immunology has changed, and once considered a flame extinguished, has reignited
from the embers.
3.1. The Cancer Immunology System and Systems Therapeutics
The view of cancer and the immune system as an integrated system is an important perspective
to develop additional targets for cancer immunotherapy. Being cognizant of the interplay of
systems is the first step to developing an appropriate model to test hypotheses. As described by
Chen and colleagues, the “cancer-immunity cycle” involves an intricate process of cancer cell

184
antigen recognition by the immune system, immune cell trafficking and tumor infiltration, and a
localized immune response to eradicate the tumor [61]. At each step of the process, a variety of
cytokines may be expressed to promote or inhibit the immune response. Checkpoints in this process
exist to support a balance of effective activity to maintain tissue homeostasis and discourage
fluctuations that could lead to the extremes of immunosenescence or autoimmunity. The following
paragraphs, we will discuss oncolytic viruses, adoptive cell transfer, chimeric antigen receptors, and
immune checkpoint modulators, in context of their role in the cancer-immunity cycle. Each is able
to alter feedback mechanisms to promote the cancer-immunity cycle via various methods. The
advantages and disadvantages of each of these therapies will also be discussed.
3.1.1. Oncolytic Viruses
Oncolytic viruses are used to target and kill cancer cells. There are two methods used to target
the oncolytic viruses to kill only cancer cells, and they can be used in combination to promote
efficacy of tumor-targeted killing. Transductional targeting of oncolytic viruses entails modifying
the viral coat proteins of the virus to target malignant cells preferentially by inhibiting the entry of
the virus into non-cancerous cells. Non-transductional targeting genetically alters the virus so that it
may only replicate in the targeted cancer cell, whereby tumor-specific transcriptional promoters are
used [62]. However, the host immune response to oncolytic viruses may vary between individuals,
and mechanisms of resistance to and effective delivery of oncolytic viruses are poorly understood [63].
The variation among patients in immune response to oncolytic viruses provides a significant
clinical barrier to their use and efficacy. However, oncolytic viruses may be used as an
experimental tool to provide insight to mechanisms of cancer evolution and immune system
response in virally-mediated cancers.
3.1.2. Adoptive Cell Transfer and Chimeric Antigen Receptors
A number of approaches have been proposed to jumpstart the cancer-immunity cycle and
maintain its efficacy. Adoptive Cell Transfer (ACT) expands T cell immunity to a particular cancer
antigen in the patient through isolation of T lymphocytes, population expansion, and reinfusion.
Cells can be genetically modified to recognize certain antigens, to infiltrate tumors more readily, or
to respond more robustly to cytokine cues [64]. One example of genetic modifications that can be
integrated into T lymphocytes in ACT involves chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). These
receptors are engineered to recognize a specific antigen, which allows this treatment method to
become tailored to an individual type of cancer and the antigens it expresses [65]. Use of CARs in
conjunction with ACT also overcomes a potential barrier with ACT and other immune modulation
therapies, which assumes that a patient’s T lymphocytes or that of a donor will recognize the
patient’s cancer cells and target them for killing. As shown by Chacon et al. [64], using
tumor-infiltrating CD8+ lymphocytes in ACT can also have an impact on the rest of the tumor
microenvironment, expanding a dynamically regulated and more competent T cell population for
killing of the tumor.

185
ACT and CARs can be modeled mathematically in two ways: (1) through mathematical
modeling of the system effects and response of directed ACT and CAR activity; and (2) by
modeling molecular level CAR interactions. When designing CARs, it is important to remember
the effect of this type of therapy on the host’s system. The plasmids used to express classical CARs
use a signaling fragment, an extracellular spacer, a co-stimulating domain, and an antibody to
direct a specific response against the tumor. However, using single-chain fragment variable (scFv)
antibodies can cause activation of the immune system in an undesirable manner. Single variable
heavy chain domains (VHH) have been shown to avoid immunogenicity. However, changing any
component of the CAR can lead to poor interaction of the receptor with its target. To improve CAR
targeting, molecular modeling can be used to predict interactions between targets and the CAR
with various components, such as a VHH directed against a particular target [66]. At the system
level, a recent study by James and colleagues modeled the target lysis achieved by alterations in
chimeric T cell receptor (cTCR) expression density, target antigen density, and activation of the
cTCR. They found that approximately 20,000 cTCRs per cell was an ideal density of expression of
the surface of the T cell. Anything above this did not increase target lysis or increase sensitivity to
the target antigen, and anything below this expression impaired target lysis activity, perhaps by
causing antigen-induced T cell death [67].
3.1.3. Immune Checkpoint Modulators
Based on remarkable clinical success, the current immunotherapies that hold the most promise
are immune checkpoint modulators. Immune checkpoints are considered natural negative feedback
mechanisms that limit an adaptive immune response to minimize the risk of autoimmunity.
Investigation of immune checkpoint modulators has been on the rise in academia, biotechnology
group, and pharmaceutical company research [68]. It is also known that in late stage cancers, the
immune system appears to be turned “off”. Part of this “immune switching” phenomenon can be
credited to the tumor actively evading the immune response through its clonal evolution of certain
cellular subpopulations [69]. As an example, metastatic melanoma is arguably one of the hardest
cancers to treat and has very few treatment options in the clinic. As an immunogenic cancer, it is
known the immune system plays a role in progression of the disease [70]. Therefore, the immune
system was targeted as a potential solution to molecular inhibitor resistance in metastatic
melanoma and other cancers. The particular proteins currently being examined for targeting include
CTLA-4, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4, and PD-1, programed death receptor-1, two regulatory
molecules on the surface of T cells [71].
A neutralizing antibody against CTLA-4, called ipilimumab, improved overall and progressionfree survival in metastatic melanoma [72] and was the first FDA-approved therapy to target cancer
through an immune checkpoint blockade. While clinical benefit was observed in only a subset of
patients, ipilimumab demonstrates an important proof-of-principle especially in metastatic
melanoma. Anti-CTLA4 immunotherapy, such as found with ipilimumab, is able to target
senescence of CD8+ cytotoxic and CD4+ T cell populations. It does this by blocking the effect of
CTLA4, a T cell inhibitory molecule similar in function to costimulatory protein CD28, on the
surface of the T lymphocyte that limits clonal expansion [73]. As this therapy globally increases T

186
cell numbers, serious adverse side effects, such as autoimmunity, are directly linked to this
function, by causing over-activation of the immune system. Ipilimumab is currently being
investigated for potential treatment of other cancer types, while other immunotherapies targeting T
cell response are also being tested for efficacy against melanoma and other cancer types to improve
efficacy and safety [68].
Similar to the actions of CTLA-4, PD-1 is also an inhibitory protein expressed on the surface of
chronically activated T cells, which show decreased TCR-mediated proliferative and cytokine-releasing
ability. Its expression is increased, compared to peripheral blood cells, on tumor-infiltrating
T-lymphocytes [74,75]. PD-1, along with its ligand that is also upregulated in the tumor
microenvironment, PD-L1, is currently being investigated as a potential immunotherapy target in
clinical trials. An anti-PD-L1 antibody was administered to patients with melanoma, colorectal,
renal-cell, ovarian, pancreatic, gastric, breast, or non-small-cell lung cancers. Patients were treated
for an average of 12 weeks and evaluated. A durable tumor regression response was recorded at
6%–17%, while 12%–41% of patients experienced prolonged disease stabilization over a period of
24 weeks [76]. Drugs targeting PD-1 or PD-L1 seem to have a slightly better safety profile compared
with anti-CTLA4 and may prove to be more effective as combination therapies [32,77].
3.1.4. Summarizing the Rise of Immunotherapies
Overall, immune system modulators, ACT therapies, and oncolytic viruses all show promise
clinically, but their considerable development and clinical costs, safety profiles, and limited
efficacy in certain patient populations are a substantial obstacle to a broad clinical impact on
patient response and management. However, these technologies and molecular targets may not only
be useful as therapeutics to treat patients in the clinic, but can be used as preclinical tools to
investigate and better define the interplay between cancer and immunology systems for further
pharmaceutical development. To ensure these tools are used in a way that minimizes financial and
patient risk in pharmaceutical development, it is necessary to use these tools in appropriate
preclinical models for investigation and success of future cancer immunotherapies. In the next
section, the use of appropriate system models that should be used with these potential preclinical
and clinical tools for cancer treatment will be discussed.
3.2. Modeling the System for Pharmaceutical Aims
Knowing the particular causal suppression mechanisms at work in a cancer from observations of
biological state is one of the most pervasive problems in the analysis of physiological systems.
In engineering, this problem is called an identification problem, where causal relationships between
system elements are inferred from a set of input cues and output responses [78]. In context of
cancer, an input cue may be antibodies against tumor-specific epitopes and an output response may
be tumor regression. Many approaches exist for the identification of simple-input-simple-output
(SISO) systemsʊwhere a change in input causes a unique change in output.
As a consequence of reductionist methods, there is a wealth of experimental data that
characterize how isolated elements of physiological systems respond to inputs. However,

187
approaches for identifying causal relationships among elements of more complex integrated
closed-loop systems, like the immune system, are less well developed. Typically, a closed-loop
system is defined as a multi-element system where the output (i.e., response) of one element
provides the input (i.e., biochemical cue) to another element. A schematic diagram of a closed-loop
system comprised of two cell types is shown in Figure 2. Closed-loop systems are particularly
challenging as it is impossible to identify the relationships among cells of a system based upon
overall input (e.g., tumor vaccines) and output (e.g., tumor regression) measurements. One of the
reasons for this is that changes in the internal state of the system may alter the response of the
system to a defined input, such that there is not a direct causal relationship between overall system
input and output.

Figure 2. Studying open-loop cellular systems, as indicated by the red open-dash box,
involves directly examining at a target cell or a cell population, without regard to the
other cells, inputs, or outputs that may be affecting the behavior of that particular cell.
Closed-loop systems examine multiple components of the overall system, including
cues going into the system, interactions within the cellular environment, and outputs
resulting from the multiple dynamics of cellular signaling and communication.
Historically, the causal mechanisms underlying the behavior of closed-loop systems in
physiology have been identified via ingenious methods for isolating elements within the integrated
system (i.e., “opening the loop”). A classic example of this is the discovery of insulin and its role in
connecting food intake to substrate metabolism. As insulin is only produced by the endocrine
pancreas, measuring plasma insulin provides a direct measure of the organ-level communication
between food intake and substrate metabolism in the peripheral tissues. The pancreas can then be
approximated as a SISO system where the glucose concentration in the portal vein is the input and
insulin release into the plasma is the output, as depicted in the Minimal Model for the regulation of
blood glucose [79]. Measuring changes in insulin in the blood in response to changes in plasma
glucose provide the basis for partitioning alterations in system response (e.g., diabetes) into

188
deficiencies in insulin production (i.e., type 1 diabetes) and insulin action (i.e., type 2 diabetes).
Treatment for diabetes is tailored to the deficiency in component function that exists in the patient.
In diabetes, “opening the loop” means identifying organ-level cross-talk using blood
measurements. In contrast, the cell-level cross-talk between tumor and immune cells occurs locally
within the tumor microenvironment and may not reach a titer sufficient enough to detect using
blood measurements.
3.2.1. Methods to Quantify and Characterize Cross-Talk: Developing Appropriate Models
Because biological systems are dynamic and require inputs from a variety of sources to maintain
homeostasis, pathway cross-talk is essential for regulation of equilibrium. Biologists have often
depended on methods to quantify this cross-talk that introduce scientific bias. Immunohistology,
for example, requires the researcher to know what they are probing for. The same concern exists in
Western blotting, classical reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), ELISAs, and
flow cytometry, which require labeling or probing for a specific molecular component. Because
levels of gene expression and proteins are dynamic in that they change with respect to both time
and response to a stimulus, it is difficult to say with certainty that a particular stimulus is direct
cause of protein expression or whether cross-talk between molecular pathways is involved and
causing an upregulation or downregulation of a particular gene and its translation into protein gene
product. This requires the researcher to have extensive knowledge of “known” pathways and relies
on previous data to support the hypothesis and conclusions.
Discovery-based research, using high-throughput methods to monitor expression level changes
in a wide variety of targets, was one way to combat this “known pathway” requirement in cancer
biomarker research. Discovery-based research, because it looks at a variety of targets, which may
or may not be known to have pathway association, may be thought of as a way to combat
methodological bias. However, in his Nature opinion paper regarding biomarker research,
Ransohoff argued target-driven discovery-based research methods still portray a bias component,
as “cancer group” samples may be handled in a particular way or undergo particular procedures
during collection and storage, whereas “normal tissue” would not. In sensitive assays, which
themselves may have these molecular pathway biases, this can make data interpretation, statistical
analyses, and conclusions difficult and a technical bias may be inadvertently contributed to the
protocol. Ransohoff also discusses “fitting” of the model during biomarker research and how this can
become a bias in data analysis and conclusions [80]. We expect certain associations of molecules or
patterns in signaling, and the researcher then tries to fit these patterns to a certain disease.
However, as protein and mRNA expression levels are highly variable and individual samples or
subjects can have divergent baselines, fitting the data to a certain model of gene or protein expression
may not be a dependable method of determining disease status conclusions.
One of the great challenges of biochemical research is that the biological activity of many gene
products are unknown, and therefore, it is unclear as to how they may influence cellular response
mechanisms. Proteomics workflow methods may remove some of the bias of probing for known
protein products. Studies conducted by our laboratory on the secretomes of a “normal” breast
epithelial line compared to the breast cancer lines BT474 and SKBR3 provided a wealth of

189
information on protein products that may be selectively secreted by breast cancers. We performed
this workflow by isolating and enriching the secretomes from the cell lines, running the samples on
a 2DE-gel and using MALDI-TOF analysis to identify proteins secreted [81]. To gain insight into
common mechanisms for altering local intercellular communication in breast cancer, we used
computational tools to identify common pathway alterations an as a way to counter uncertainty due
to the inherent variability among samples and limits to sensitivity of this experimental approach.
An alternative approach to identify alterations in intracellular communication is to develop
phenotypic screening assays. While the contemporary focus has largely been on target-based drug
discovery, phenotypic screening produced greater than 60% of first-in-class small molecule drugs
approved by the FDA between 1999 and 2008 [82]. Phenotypic screening assays are one method of
discover-based research that does not rely on target-based screening, as do many discovery-based
research methods, and is making a return to the field of pharmaceutical research [83]. Phenotypic
screening assays rely on observing the effects of a particular stimulus on a given outcome, rather
than the players that may cause that outcome. It allows for some uncertainty on what particular
pathways are involved to effect disease status and can give insight to unknown molecular
interactions and molecules acting via previously undiscovered mechanisms. To illustrate the
approach, we developed a phenotypic screening assay to identify biochemical cues responsible for
local immunosuppression in vitro, validated these mechanisms in human tumor biopsy specimens,
and correlated these putative immunosuppressive mechanisms with clinical outcomes [84,85]. The
phenotypic screening assay also incorporated a mathematical model that provides a quantitative
prediction of a T cell response to Interleukin-12 in terms of cytokine production and cell fate. As
multiple factors were observed in the phenotypic screening assay, the mathematical model
provided a quantitative context to determine whether the observed factors were sufficient to explain
the observed changes in T cell response or whether there were additional behaviors that were
unexplained.
3.2.2. Computer Simulation Provides a Translational Bridge Across Model Systems
Even after defining signaling pathway components, it is still difficult for scientists to predict the
overall behavior of the system. Animal models are most commonly used to predict the human
response to a particular therapy and to replicate human systems. However, success of therapeutic
interventions seems to be more easily attained in animals and brings to question the translational
viability of animal models of disease [86]. As discussed previously, methodological bias may play
a role in these discrepancies. Moreover, humans are known to have fundamental differences in
biology, regardless of whether molecular components are conserved, and animal models are usually
made of clones of a particular population. Therefore, this does not account for the heterogeneity of
the human population, which will attribute different clinical responses. Additionally, it is unclear
how conserved cellular signaling networks across different model systems. The heterogeneity of
tumor cell populations and individual metabolic and disease state differences may further cloud this
issue, even when “normal” human cellular networks are well-defined.
Novel drug targets are often difficult to predict, due to the interplay of multiple genes and
systems and the differences between human and animal models. To overcome these barriers to

190
disease modeling, computer simulation using previous molecular interaction and human clinical
data may be able to elucidate these signaling network differences [9,87]. Quantitative systems
pharmacology is now being used to analyze drug interactions and provide insight to adverse effects,
and has been suggested as a method of selecting better drug candidates for development [9]. Two
recent studies highlight the different functions computer modeling may perform in aiding in
drug development.
In a study examining prostate cancer malignancies, human and mouse model data was analyzed
to determine master regulators of prostate cancer using the Algorithm for the Reconstruction of
Accurate Cellular Networks (ARACNe), which uses microarray data to predict direct molecular
interactions [88,89]. A Master Regulator Inference algorithm (MARINa) was then used to
determine gene regulators of prostate cancer. Co-expression of FOXM1 and CENPF was
determined to promote prostate cancer malignancy by synergistically acting via the PI3K and
MAPK pathways. This suggests a complicated feedback system that may be therapeutically difficult
to target with current treatments [88]. Using this analysis could serve as a way to determine gene
interactions in tumor development and to help to better classify tumors based on their phenotypes
and genotypes.
Knowing gene regulators of malignancy could also be helpful in finding new targets for therapy
and determining adverse effects before they are observed in the clinic. In a study regarding druginduced peripheral neuropathy, data from DrugBank and Therapeutic Target Database was used to
create pharmacological networks of peripheral neuropathy-inducing drugs, their known targets, and
the diseases for which they are used to treat. The Database for Annotation, Visualization, and
Integrated Discovery (DAVID) was then used to identify connections between drug targets and
cellular pathways. Regulation of two genes, MYC and PAF15, were found to be correlated with a
higher incidence of drug-induced peripheral neuropathy and suggested drugs that may produce this
adverse effect, as well as targets for future studies to alleviate neuropathy symptoms in the clinic [90].
4. Conclusions
One of the most costly decisions a pharmaceutical company can make in regards to a cancer
immunotherapy is selecting the patient population to conduct the clinical trial. Success of the drug
is often determined by which patient populations the study is conducted in. If an inappropriate
cancer phenotype is selected for the study, adverse events or inefficacy can stop the study and
discourage the drug from continuing in the development pipeline. Troubleshooting and optimizing
the drug could prove more costly than developing an entirely different drug. Most cell lines do not
contain heterogeneous populations of cancer cells, let alone T cells and other stromal cells, which
can lead to misleading results in preclinical trials for determining optimal cancer phenotypes.
Given validation of these computational methods, and by combining methods to investigate both
drug response and molecular signaling, we can begin to properly examine cellular networks to infer
on whether our biological experimental methods correctly forecast patient outcomes and portray an
accurate representation of biological activity of a certain therapy or whether that therapy is
appropriate for use in a certain patient population. Using computational tools to model relevant
signaling networks and cancer immunity may also remove some of the bias associated with sample

191
processing and inappropriate biological method selection. To improve the translational value of
these approaches, they should account for clonal evolution and heterogeneity of the system.
Combining system-targeting drugs with system modeling and phenotypic assays is in line with NIH
recommendations for more quantitative and systems pharmacology research, and could prove to be
our best resource in engaging host immunity in the fight against cancer. Given our currently known
limitations and the recent developments in cancer immunotherapy research, the pharmaceutical
industry can reinvigorate their model for innovation with the help of quantitative and systems
pharmacology techniques and focusing on a systems perspective with respect to cancer.

Network Analysis Identifies Crosstalk Interactions Governing
TGF-ȕ Signaling Dynamics during Endoderm Differentiation
of Human Embryonic Stem Cells
Shibin Mathew, Sankaramanivel Sundararaj and Ipsita Banerjee
Abstract: The fate choice of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) is controlled by complex
signaling milieu synthesized by diverse chemical factors in the growth media. Prevalence of
crosstalks and interactions between parallel pathways renders any analysis probing the process of
fate transition of hESCs elusive. This work presents an important step in the evaluation of network
level interactions between signaling molecules controlling endoderm lineage specification from
hESCs using a statistical network identification algorithm. Network analysis was performed on
detailed signaling dynamics of key molecules from TGF-ȕ/SMAD, PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK
pathways under two common endoderm induction conditions. The results show the existence of
significant crosstalk interactions during endoderm signaling and they identify differences in
network connectivity between the induction conditions in the early and late phases of signaling
dynamics. Predicted networks elucidate the significant effect of modulation of AKT mediated
crosstalk leading to the success of PI3K inhibition in inducing efficient endoderm from hESCs in
combination with TGF-ȕ/SMAD signaling.

1. Introduction
Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are a promising raw material for regenerative medicine
applications because of their potential for directed differentiation into clinically relevant cell types.
In differentiating hESCs to lineages of pancreas, liver, etc., an important first step is the induction
of Definitive Endoderm (called endoderm henceforth) [1]. The quality of later stage maturation is
dictated by the initial pathway of endoderm differentiation [2]. Extensive research over a decade
have given rise to alternate protocols for endoderm induction of hESCs that employ unique
combinations of growth factors and small molecules [3–7]. These protocols aim to recapitulate
signaling dynamics mimicking in vivo development of endoderm. Among these signaling
mediators, activation of TGF-ȕ/SMAD2,3 pathway by ligand molecules like Activin A (called
Activin henceforth) has been identified as necessary to induce endoderm differentiation of hESCs [8].
Additionally, secondary modulation of parallel pathways have been shown to enhance endoderm
specific differentiation; these include inhibition of PI3K pathway [4], or activation of FGF + BMP4
pathways [3], or activation of WNT pathway [6]. Among these commonly used supplementary
constituents, inhibition of PI3K pathway has been consistently reported to enhance endoderm
differentiation of hESCs in conjunction with Activin induction [9]. The resulting endoderm cells
show good potential to transform into pancreatic ȕ-like cells with continued differentiation [2,10].

198
The process of differentiation is induced by activation of specific signaling molecules by growth
factors and small molecules. Activin in culture media binds to type 1 and type 2 receptors on the
cell surface to form active heteromeric complexes [11]. These receptors then regulate downstream
signals using the same mechanism as TGF-ȕ receptor complexes. Briefly, the ligand receptor
complex is responsible for C-terminal phosphorylation of regulatory SMAD molecules, namely
SMAD2 and SMAD3 [12]. Active regulatory SMADs form homomeric complexes and they also
complex with co-regulatory molecules like SMAD4 to form heteromeric complexes. These
complexes shuttle to the nucleus to orchestrate a host of gene transcriptional events that maintain
homeostasis and activate developmental programs [13]. Previous studies have shown that SMAD
molecules play a major role in fate choice of hESCs [14–16]. However, the context of survival
pathways like PI3K/AKT and mitogen activated pathways like MAPK/ERK ultimately decides
whether active SMAD complexes support self-renewal or differentiation of hESCs. This is because
of critical crosstalk interactions between TGF-ȕ/SMAD and these other pathways participating in
development [14,17].
Multiple experimental reports have shown the existence of significant crosstalk interfering with
the TGF-ȕ pathway during endoderm differentiation [17,18]. The efficiency of endoderm
differentiation is consequently diminished without appropriate removal of interaction with parallel
pathways. In spite of several experimental reports, there has not been a thorough mathematical and
network level analysis of the existing interactions, which is the focus of the current paper. The
primary goal of this work is to quantitatively evaluate the existence of network interactions and the
direction of interaction from signaling dynamics of hESCs differentiating to endoderm. Due to the
high variability associated with hESC systems, it is also necessary to infer robust connections from
noisy data. Bayesian models provide a natural framework to investigate the causal dependence
between nodes in a network and derive probabilistic relationships that most likely explain
experimental observations [19]. These models have proven successful in network reconstruction
from noisy signal transduction data [20,21]. Among the different Bayesian models, non-stationary
Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) provide the best representation of the adaptive nature of
signal transduction networks [22].
In the present work, interactions between the signaling molecules belonging to the TGF-ȕ/SMAD,
PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK pathways controlling endoderm differentiation of hESCs were
identified. The nature of interactions present in the signaling network and the sequence of signal
propagation events are cumulatively captured in the dynamics of key molecules in a signaling
pathway [23]. As a first step, a multiplex measurement platform was used to measure detailed
dynamics of multiple signaling molecules of the TGFȕ pathway along with key crosstalk
molecules. The measurements were made under Activin induction condition along with a perturbed
case where PI3K pathway was simultaneously inhibited. DBN analysis conducted on the entire
time series of key signaling molecules from these pathways elucidated the presence of multiple
crosstalk interactions regulating the endoderm induction conditions. The results show that the
receptor levels play an important role in controlling majority of the intracellular signaling
molecules in the early and late phases of the signaling dynamics. Further, molecule from
PI3K/AKT pathway (p-AKT) shows significant crosstalk interactions in the high PI3K condition,

199
which is removed in the low PI3K condition. The early signaling dynamics contained enough
information to recapitulate the key crosstalk interactions. Overall, the analysis provided
explanations for the network level differences between the Activin alone and Activin + PI3K
inhibition condition used for endoderm induction. The DBNs showed the key crosstalk interactions
removed under Activin + PI3K inhibition providing an explanation for its good endoderm
differentiation potential at the signaling level.
2. Methods
2.1. Cell Culture and Treatment
2.1.1. Human ESC Maintenance
H1 hESCs were placed on hESC certified Matrigel (BD Biosciences, Billerica, MA, USA)-coated
tissue culture plate for 5–7 days in mTESR1 (Stemcell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) at
37 °C and 5% CO2 before passaging. Cells were examined under the microscope every day and
colonies with observable differentiation were picked and removed before the media changes. The
maintenance protocol was adopted from our previous studies [2,9,10].
2.1.2. Experimental Induction of Endoderm from hESCs
Human ESCs were allowed to grow to 60%–70% confluency before experiments were started.
Once confluency was reached, endoderm differentiation was induced by adding 100 ng/mL Activin
A (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) in the presence or absence of 1 ȝM Wortmannin
(PI3K inhibitor; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 24 h (or otherwise indicated).
The differentiation media were made using DMEM/F12 (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NE,
USA), supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,
USA) and 1xB27 (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NE, USA). The induction protocol for
endoderm was adopted from our previous study [2,9].
2.1.3. Measuring Experimental Dynamics of Signaling Molecules
Intracellular expression of signaling proteins were measured by MagPix analysis using the
TGFȕ Signaling Pathway Magnetic Bead 6-Plex Cell Signaling Multiplex Assay (EMD Millipore,
Catalog no.: 48-614MAG) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The detailed protocol for
MagPix is described in our previous study [10]. Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was measured
using the xMAP (Luminex, Madison, WI, USA) instrument. Measurements were obtained for 6 analytes,
namely total TGFȕ receptor 2 (t-TGFȕRII), total SMAD4 (t-SMAD4), phosphorylated SMAD2
(p-SMAD2 Ser465/Ser467), p-SMAD3 (Ser423/Ser425), p-AKT (Ser473) and p-ERK
(Thr185/Tyr187). The time points selected for analysis were: 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 h
(10 time points, each from a different well of tissue culture plate). Three repeats were conducted
per experimental condition and quantitative analysis was performed on each repeat separately.

200
Total protein content of the sample was measured using BCA total protein kit (Thermo Scientific,
Grand Island, NE, USA), according to manufacturer’s instructions.
2.2. Identification of Network Interactions from Experimental Time Series Signaling Data
A DBN analysis was performed to identify the network structure that can explain the dynamics
of signaling molecules during endoderm differentiation. Bayesian networks are probabilistic
graphical models that relate nodes via directed edges, with the direction showing the causal
relationship between the nodes [19]. These relationships are stronger as compared to correlative
methods. Graphical models have nodes that represent entities that can interact (here molecules) and
edges show how the nodes influence each other. The node where the edge originates is commonly
called a parent node and the node where the edge ends is called a child node. Each node in the
network is described by conditional probabilities as tables or functions. In continuous space, the
relationship is represented by conditional probability distributions, and Gaussian distributions are
commonly used to model the relationships [19,24]. Bayesian networks however cannot represent
cyclic loops like feedbacks that are common in signal transduction networks. The problem of cyclic
loops can be overcome by use of a generalization of Bayesian networks via DBNs [25].
2.2.1. Details of DBN Algorithm
DBNs relate variables between adjacent time points such that a child node at a given time point
is related to the parent nodes at a previous time point, thereby expanding the network in time.
Based on the system and the dynamics, the relationship can go back one or several time steps. A
common approach to construct DBN is by using score equivalence criterion [24]. Here, a scoring
metric (for example, maximum likelihood (ML) estimate in combination with regularization
strategies) is used to evaluate how well a graph reconstructs the experimental data. Although DBNs
provide good representation of biological networks, they are computationally expensive. Recently
Grzegorczyk et al. developed a computationally efficient algorithm to identify non-stationary
DBNs [25]. Specifically, in non-stationary DBNs, the network structure is kept constant between
different time points, but the model parameters are allowed to vary between different time
segments. The method has been successful in discovering biologically relevant interactions from
diverse biological data sets including times series of gene expression and Milliplex protein
concentrations across species [25–31]. The model systems are diverse, including circadian rhythms in
A. thaliana, morphogenesis in D. melanogaster, synthetic metabolic networks in S. cerevisiae, serum
inflammatory cytokine mediators in pediatric acute liver injury etc. [27,32]. Full details of the
algorithm are presented in the manuscript and supplementary material of Grzegorczyk et al. [25]. A
brief discussion of the algorithm based on the original manuscript is presented below.
Consider a set of N interacting nodes of a signaling network represented by X1, X 2 ,....., X n and a
directed graph structure G. An edge pointing from Xi to X j in a DBN with time lag equal to one
time step shows that the realization of X j at time step t is dependent on the realization of its parent
Xi at time step t í 1. It is commonly assumed that a time lag equal to one time step is sufficient to
represent the relationship, indicating that the data have to be sampled at the right time intervals for

201
the dynamics to be represented correctly. The parent node set, π j , of a node X j is the set of all
nodes from which an edge points to X j in G . Grzegorczyk et al. proposed a non-stationary
generalization of the Bayesian Gaussian with score equivalence model (called BGe), and it is a
node-specific mixture of BGe models [25]. A linear Gaussian distribution is chosen for the local
conditional distributions. The non-stationary DBN is based on the following Markov chain expansion:

where, D is the time course data, δVn(t ),k is the Kronecker delta, V is a matrix of latent variables
that indicate which BGe mixture component generates a data point, K = ( ț1 ,...,țn ) is a vector of
mixture components, m is the total number of time points. Vectors and matrices are denoted by
single underbars in the symbols of all the equations of this manuscript. Each column of matrix V is
the vector V n , which divides the time series for a node into different time segments. The endpoints
of these time segments are called as change-points. Each time segment between change-points is a
different BGe model with parameters θ nk , which includes the mean and covariance matrix of the
conditional dependences for the mixture component. The allocation scheme in Equation (1)
provides representation of a nonlinear regulatory process by a piecewise linear process. From
Equation (1), the marginal likelihood conditional on the latent variables is given by:

Equation (4) is the local change-point BGe score (called as cpBGe) for node n. In this work, a
Gibbs MCMC sampling scheme was followed to sample from the local posterior distributions.
Although, the location of change-points is inferred, the actual values of the parameters are not
directly obtained since they are integrated out as seen from Equation (3). In this manuscript,
correlation analysis was used in selected time segments to evaluate the nature of influence. In the
algorithm, the change-points were sampled from a point process prior using dynamic programming
and the graphs were sampled by sampling parent node set (restricted to 3 parents per node) from a
Boltzmann posterior distribution using the cpBGe score. Additional details of the sampling
procedure is given in [25]. The codes provided online by Grzegorczyk et al. were used in this
work [25]. The sampling parameters were kept at nominal values suggested by Grzegorczyk et al.
All simulations were performed in MATLAB® (Natick, MA, USA) on Linux 64-bit platform and
single core of INTEL® (Santa Clara, CA, USA) Core™ 2 Quad CPU (Q8400 @ 2.66 GHz).

2.2.2. Constructing the DBNs
The DBN analysis was performed on each of the two experimental conditions separately to
identify the network interactions that exist in each condition. The data were preprocessed as
described in the results section prior to the DBN analysis (see Section 3.2). To construct the DBN,
the marginal edge probability was monitored for each Gibbs sampling step. The marginal edge
probability for a given edge denotes the fraction of the graphs in which that edge was present. Each
Gibbs sampling step represents an instance of the network that can best explain the experimental
time series. In the early phases of the simulation, the network is not yet stabilized and hence, the
likelihood scores and the marginal edge probabilities fluctuate. The marginal edge probabilities of
the final network were calculated after a burn-in phase when the distributions have stabilized. The
DBN algorithm was applied to each repeat of the three available for each condition. The marginal
edge probability scores from networks obtained for the three repeats were averaged to obtain a
consensus network for a given condition or time zone. Finally, only those edges that were present
in more than 50% of the sampled graphs were kept in the consensus DBN, a criterion used in the
study by Azhar et al. [27]. Any value less than 50% indicates that the number of samples in which
the associated edge was absent is more than the number of samples in which it is present. Specific
details of the application of DBN for the dataset evaluated in this paper are explained in Section 3.2.
3. Results and Discussion

3.1. Dynamics of Signaling Molecules during Endoderm Induction
Figure 1 shows the dynamics of six signaling molecules after Activin A addition in the presence
(shown by blue dashed line) and absence (shown by red continuous line) of PI3K inhibitor, called
as low and high PI3K conditions respectively. The original data was normalized by time 0 values to
obtain the fold change. The mean levels and standard deviation from 3 experimental repeats are
plotted here. The time points selected for the study include: 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 h.
The high PI3K condition represents the differentiation protocol where only the TGF-ȕ/SMAD2,3
pathway is externally activated while the PI3K/AKT pathway is left unperturbed. In this condition,
p-AKT levels are maintained near the basal levels, only slightly lower (Figure 1A). For the purpose
of this manuscript, the basal levels are defined as the protein levels at time 0. It is seen that the
mean levels of p-AKT fluctuate in the early time points (<6 h). Levels of t-TGFȕRII (Figure 1B)
also remain close to basal levels under high PI3K signaling. For p-SMAD2 (Figure 1C), an
overshoot behavior is seen with levels reaching the maximum within 2–3 h and settling at
intermediate levels by 6 h. For p-SMAD3 (Figure 1D), the dynamics shows a different behavior
than p-SMAD2 even though both are activated by the same ligand-receptor complex. In general,
the dynamics shows a continuous increase instead of the overshoot behavior seen for p-SMAD2.
t-SMAD4 (Figure 1E) is maintained near the basal levels for this condition. p-ERK shows a
minimal and delayed increase (Figure 1F) under high PI3K.

Figure 1. Dynamics of key molecules from the TGF-ȕ/SMAD, PI3K/AKT and
MAPK/ERK pathways for two endoderm induction conditions. (A–F) p-AKT, t-TGFȕRII,
p-SMAD2, p-SMAD3, t-SMAD4 and p-ERK dynamics under high and low PI3K
conditions. H1 hESCs were treated with 100 ng/mL Activin A in the presence or
absence of 1 ȝM Wortmannin (PI3K inhibitor) for 24 h. The protein levels were
quantified using Multiplex MagPix Assay. The mean and standard deviation (number
of repeats = 3) in protein levels are represented here as fold change over time 0 levels.
The low PI3K condition represents a modulation over the high PI3K condition with the
PI3K/AKT pathway externally inhibited in addition to activation of TGF-ȕ/SMAD2,3 pathway. In
this condition, we see a considerable decrease in p-AKT levels since it is a downstream effector of
PI3K signal (Figure 1A). However, interestingly this decrease is short-lived. Even after continued
inhibition of PI3K, the levels of p-AKT start increasing from 3 h with the levels reaching near basal
levels by 12 h. The levels of t-TGFȕRII in this condition are lower than high PI3K condition at
time points from 6 h (Figure 1B). The dynamics of p-SMAD2 is similar to the high PI3K condition
(Figure 1C) with slightly higher fold-change at early time points. The fold-change in p-SMAD3 is
higher compared to high PI3K signaling and it also shows substantial increase at later time points.
t-SMAD4 (Figure 1E) shows fluctuations at early time points and a slight reduction at later time
points (from 6 h). p-ERK (Figure 1F) shows a slow rise as compared to p-SMAD2,3 and the
increase is substantial as compared to high PI3K signaling. Thus, overall, the low PI3K condition
results in higher fold-changes in levels of phosphorylated SMAD3 and ERK than high PI3K
condition. Further, low PI3K results in higher expression of two important endoderm genes, SOX17
and CER (Figure S1, also see [9] for more marker comparisons).
The dynamics shown in Figure 1 is the first detailed study of signaling dynamics obtained for
hESCs under endoderm induction conditions. Two unique features are observed for hESCs, namely

204
the rise in p-AKT levels under continued PI3K inhibition and the divergent dynamics of p-SMAD2
and p-SMAD3 under high Activin levels. Further, as is typical for hESC system, there is high
degree of variability in the levels of most molecules and the degree of variability is different at
different time points. The variability is higher for low PI3K condition, a possible effect resulting
from high degree of cell death observed in this condition since PI3K is an important cell survival
pathway. The differences in the levels and dynamics of molecules between high and low PI3K
conditions indicate existence of crosstalk interactions between the TGF-ȕ/SMAD2,3, PI3K/AKT and
MAPK/ERK pathways. Previous reports from the Dalton group has indicated interactions between
these pathways using static end-point analysis [17]. Here, we use a computational framework to
identify all possible interactions from the information contained in the signaling dynamics.

3.2. Predictions of Network Interactions by DBN Analysis on Entire Time Series
We employed DBN algorithm developed by Grzegorczyk et al. for network identification [25].
As detailed in Section 2.2.1, the algorithm infers a causal relationship (hence directed graph)
between the nodes in the network across any two adjacent time points from a given time series
data. To apply the algorithm to the high and low PI3K data, the data were preprocessed by
normalizing the raw MFI values of each protein by its maximum MFI value for the given time
series. The data consists of 10 time points, namely 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 h for 6 nodes
in the network and 3 experimental repeats per condition. The normalized data are presented in the
supplementary figures, Figures S2 and S3 for high and low PI3K conditions respectively. A
common concern with biological datasets is the inherent variability arising from batch-to-batch and
well-to-well variability. This is further enhanced in hESC systems, used in the current work, due to
inherent variations in differentiation, which cannot be conveniently controlled in the current
experimental setting. However, even though the individual repeats elicited high variability in
measured MFI values, many features of the overall protein dynamics was largely conserved (see
Figures S2 and S3). Hence we performed the DBN on normalized data for each individual repeats
separately. Figure 2 presents the directed graphs (or digraphs, used interchangeably in this
manuscript) obtained from the DBN analysis.
3.2.1. DBN Analysis and Consensus Graph
Figure 2A,C shows the consensus digraphs for the high and low PI3K data. To construct the
graph, DBN is first performed for each of the three repeats separately. This gives rise to three
DBNs for each condition. The consensus graph in Figure 2 is constructed by averaging the edge
probability across the repeats and keeping the edges that occur  50% of the times. The
convergence diagnostics for the DBNs for each repeat is presented in Figure S4. The log likelihood
score stabilized very early in the sampling runs for both conditions (see Figure S4A,B). For the
current data, it was found that 250 Gibbs sampling steps were sufficient to converge to the
marginal edge posterior distribution (see Figure S4C,D). This was confirmed over independent
sampling runs, due to stochastic nature of the algorithm. Then, 500 sampling steps were performed to
obtain enough samples in the converged region to calculate the marginal edge probabilities. At the

205
end of 500 Gibbs sampling steps, the final marginal edge probabilities were calculated using the
latter half of the 500 samples (the early half belongs to the burn-in phase of the simulation). The
mean marginal edge probabilities from the three samples are presented in Figure 2B,D. Any edge,
which was present in less than 50% of the samples, was removed from the consensus graph. Note
that the DBN for each sample represents the network that can explain the entire time series of that
sample, with only network parameters allowed to vary between time segments.

parent node is the node whose value at time step (t í 1) affects the value of child node
at time step t; (C) Consensus graph for low PI3K data; (D) Marginal edge probability
table for low PI3K data.
3.2.2. High PI3K Condition
The consensus graph shows the average interactions that are present for the given experimental
condition across the three samples. As seen from Figure 2A, the dynamics of the receptor
influences all the other molecules in the network, both molecules of the TGF-ȕ pathway G
(p-SMAD2,3, SMAD4) and molecules of parallel pathways (p-AKT and p-ERK). The receptor is
also self-regulated. The mean marginal edge probabilities in Figure 2B show that these edges are
present in 100% of the sampled graphs (t-TGFȕRII as the parent node and all the other molecules
including the receptor being the child node). Next common edges include p-ERK regulation by

206
p-AKT and p-AKT regulation by p-SMAD3 present in 97% and 96% of the graphs respectively.
Remaining possible interactions include: Regulation of the receptor levels by p-AKT (74%), tSMAD4 by p-AKT and t-SMAD4 (60%–70%), p-SMAD3 by p-AKT (55%), p-AKT selfregulation (52%), p-SMAD3 and p-ERK by t-SMAD4 (57%). The graphs for the individual repeats
are presented in Figure S5.
3.2.3. Low PI3K Condition
For the low PI3K condition, the edges originating from the receptor are similar to the high PI3K
case and are also reflected in 100% of the graphs (Figure 2C,D). Next highly represented edges
include p-SMAD2 regulation by t-SMAD4 (94%) and t-SMAD4 self-regulation (81%). Remaining
possible interactions include: t-SMAD4 as a parent node for p-SMAD3 (77%), p-AKT (76%),
p-ERK (56%), p-ERK as the parent node for t-TGFȕRII (71%) and p-AKT (50%), p-SMAD2 as a
parent node for t-TGFȕRII (77%), p-SMAD2 (76%), t-SMAD4 (58%) and p-ERK (51%). The
graphs for the individual repeats are presented in Figure S6.
3.2.4. Comparison between Digraphs of High and low PI3K Conditions
Influence of Total Receptor Levels
The DBN analysis identified several similarities and differences in the interactions present in the
two conditions. Firstly, the dynamics of the total receptor levels affect the downstream molecules
in both the conditions. This influence of total receptor levels is reflected in all the individual
samples across both the conditions (Figures S5 and S6). This indicates that the changes in the
receptor levels are important in influencing the downstream molecules during endoderm induction.
Interactions between Intracellular Molecules
Among the TGF-ȕ pathway molecules, p-SMAD2 has increased regulatory interactions in the
low PI3K condition, especially influencing the receptor levels. Further, p-SMAD2 shows influence
on p-SMAD3 and p-ERK in sample 1 of high PI3K (Figure S5). p-SMAD3 shows interactions with
p-AKT in the high PI3K condition. This interaction is removed in the low PI3K condition. The low
PI3K condition also shows increased role for t-SMAD4 in influencing the p-SMAD2 and
p-SMAD3 dynamics. p-AKT shows striking differences in the connections between the
two conditions. For example, p-AKT interacts with and regulates majority of the nodes in the high
PI3K condition. However, in the low PI3K condition, p-AKT does not regulate other nodes, but
instead acts as a child node for all of its interactions. This is an interesting prediction, because the
levels of p-AKT increased back in spite of continued inhibition in the low PI3K condition. The
current analysis indicates that a short-term decrease in p-AKT levels is sufficient to remove the
influence of p-AKT on TGF-ȕ pathway molecules. Next important difference is in the regulatory
role of p-ERK. p-ERK is not regulating any of the other nodes in the high PI3K condition. This is
also reflected in each of the repeats in high PI3K condition (Figure S5). Interestingly in the low
PI3K condition, p-ERK takes an important role in regulating the receptors. p-ERK shows increased

207
regulatory role on p-SMAD3 and t-SMAD4 in one of the samples (see sample 3 in Figure S6). This
sample also had the highest increase in p-ERK by 24 h among all the samples (data not shown),
indicating that this specific sample is crossing the threshold for p-ERK mediated regulation of
SMAD molecules.
3.2.5. Change-points Inferred by cpBGe Model
During DBN analysis, the algorithm segments the time series data in a non-supervised,
node-specific manner. The ends of these time segments are called as change-points.
Mathematically, the parameters of the distribution change at a change-point, but the specific
structure of the network is not allowed to vary. Therefore, the nature (strength and/or direction) of
the regulatory relation between the nodes for all the time points of a segment remains the same but
different from the time points in the preceding and succeeding segments. Currently, the algorithm
fits a Gaussian mixture model for each node separately and assigns the time points in the data to a
specific mixture component. Two time points belonging to the same mixture component of a node
will show the same regulatory relation with its parent nodes at these two time points. The algorithm
also calculates the posterior probability of pairs of time points being co-allocated in this way. The
co-allocation matrices for the time steps of high and low PI3K condition for each repeat are shown
in Figure 3. The axes of each plot represent the time step (whose actual value is given at the bottom
of the figure). The black/white shading of the plot shows the posterior probability of two time
points being assigned to the same mixture component of the cpBGe model. Black region shows 0
probability while white region shows a probability of 1. This plot can be made for each node in the
network. For the current data, it was observed that all the nodes showed identical change-points,
indicating that these nodes are regulated together. The co-allocation plot in Figure 3 is
representative of all the nodes in the network.
Based on Figure 3, many of the adjacent time points are well correlated as the high probability
regions fall along the diagonals of the plot. This is an important observation given that each time
point is obtained from different tissue culture well in the same experiment. More importantly, here
we concentrate on those time segments that maintain the same regulatory relation for at least three
consecutive time points. The high PI3K condition shows four main segments for each repeat
(Figure 3A). Out of these, (0.5, 1, 1.5 h) and (6, 12, 18 h) are the segments containing three time
points in at least two of the repeats. In each of these time segments, the parent node is active for the
first two time points and the associated child node is active for the last two time points. Hence, the
same regulatory relation between the parent and child node is active for at least two time points.
Although the regulatory relation is changing frequently along the time series, the most repeated
network edges are not changing along the time series, as they are kept fixed by the algorithm. The
low PI3K data shows more variability in the number of change-points. Repeats 1, 2 and 3 show
four, five and three time segments respectively. Of these, repeat 2 contains very short time
segments. Only one of the time segments, containing (0.5, 1 and 1.5 h) is repeated twice in
repeats 1 and 3.
The presence of many change-points in the same condition may be because of high variability in
data, which is common for hESC systems. However, the presence of highly likely interactions

208
identified by the DBNs indicates that there is a high degree of correlation between the nodes in
spite of the variability in the data. In addition, the presence of correlation between many of the
adjacent time points indicate that in spite of the uncontrolled variations, the dynamic information of
signal transfer is still maintained.

Figure 3. Co-allocation matrices for the high and low PI3K time series. (A) High PI3K
condition; (B) Low PI3K condition. The axes represent time step. The actual time
values corresponding to the time step are given below the plots. The black/white
shading indicates the posterior probability of two time points being assigned to the
same mixture component, ranging from 0 (black) to 1 (white). As seen from the figure,
there are several time segments inferred from the data, 4 for the high PI3K condition and
3–5 for the low PI3K condition. All nodes show identical change-point behavior (data not
shown), although this was not pre-fixed in the algorithm. The crosses indicate the time
segments selected for network inference in different time zones.

3.3. Changes in Regulatory Structure across Time Zones
Previous section showed that the same regulatory relationship is maintained within some of the
early and late time zones. This includes (0.5, 1, 1.5 h) which for both conditions is taken as early.
The time points (6, 12, 18 h) are taken as late for high PI3K data and (12, 18, 24 h) for the low
PI3K data. Since these early and late time segments have a consistent sampling interval of 0.5 and
6 h respectively, they were selected for further analysis to check if the regulatory interactions
existing in the early and late time zones of the dynamics is the same (these segments are marked by
crosses in Figure 3). This is necessary to check if the crosstalk interactions exist throughout the
24 h time series, or only in certain time zones. Therefore, DBN analysis was done on each zone
separately. It is important to note that each of the resulting networks is particular to the time segment
of interest since the algorithm has not seen data from the other zone. Nevertheless, the regulatory

209
structure identified in each segment will confirm if these segments contain similar information as
any other portion of the dynamics.
3.3.1. High PI3K Condition
Figure 4A,B presents the consensus graph and marginal edge probabilities respectively for the
early time points averaged over repeats 2 and 3. The network is very similar to the network
obtained using the entire time series of high PI3K condition (Figure 2A), with some minor
differences. The key regulations by the receptor as well as supplementary crosstalk interactions are
identified from the early time points. Figure 4C,D presents the consensus graph and marginal edge
probabilities respectively for the late time points, averaged over repeats 1 and 2. The network
obtained only contains regulation by the receptor and some repeats contain the regulation by
p-AKT on the receptor and p-ERK levels.

The performance of DBN algorithm is dependent on the sampling resolution of the dataset, and
increased time points to a certain extent have been shown to reduce falsely identified
connections [33]. Since in our current analysis in Figure 4 we are restricted to low number of time

210
points, we further verified our prediction by artificially increasing the sampling resolution of the
dataset by linear interpolation of the original experimental data. It is important to note that the
original sampling time points were based on the fact that the TGF-ȕ signaling pathway shows a
slow response (with dynamic changes of the order of hours in many cell lines [34]) and at the
current sampling resolution, the key dynamic features like slow increase/decrease, first order and
overshoot behavior are captured fairly well. Hence, a linear interpolation is a good assumption for
the current analysis. The resulting consensus graphs obtained by tripling the data points (Figure
S7A) shows that the most repeated connections involving the receptor mediated and p-AKT mediated
dependences are re-captured in the resolved data-set. However, some of the less represented
connections (mostly those with edge probability less than 0.58) originating from p-SMAD3 and
t-SMAD4 are lost and p-SMAD2 regulation is regained. When additional time points were added,
no further changes in the graph were observed (data not shown), as also seen by Yu et al. where the
number of true and false positive connections reached a plateau after a certain point [33]. Similar
conclusions are seen for the late time points (Figure S7B). Hence this increases confidence on the
current predictions, indicating the robustness of the more repeated connections.
3.3.2. Low PI3K Condition
Figure 5A,B presents the consensus graph and marginal edge probabilities respectively for the
early time points, averaged over repeats 1 and 3. The network is very similar to the network
obtained using the entire time series of low PI3K condition (Figure 2B), with some minor
differences. The key regulations by the receptor as well as supplementary crosstalk interactions are
identified from the early time points. Figure 5C,D presents the consensus graph and marginal edge
probabilities respectively for the late time points. Here late time points of 12, 18 and 24 h for repeat
3 were chosen based on Figure 3. It is seen that only the receptor-mediated regulation is identified
in this region with no additional crosstalk interactions identified. When the sampling resolution is
increased to contain triple the current number of time points in the early and late phases each,
similar conclusions (see Figure S8) are obtained as the high PI3K case, with most represented
connections from Figure 5 retained and some less represented connections (<0.51 in early
and <0.63 in the late phase) lost.

3.4. Correlation between Molecule Pairs in the Early and Late Time Zones
The DBNs do not directly infer the strength and direction of regulation (positive or negative).
This is because the parameters are integrated out during the calculation of the cpBGe scores (see
Equation (3)). Alternately, this can be investigated by using correlation metrics. Since the algorithm
here fits a linear Gaussian mixture model at each time segment between the change-points, the
nature of interaction between pairs of nodes (parent and child nodes) within a time segment can be
measured using linear correlation coefficients. For the purpose of comparison, Pearson correlation
coefficient between pairs of molecules was calculated at the early and late time zones for each
condition and averaged over the time zones for repeats selected from Figure 3. These coefficients are
presented in Figure 6. Note that in Figure 6 the influence of a selected node on all the other nodes in

211
the network (not just the child node) is presented. Based on the identified DBNs, the correlation
coefficients are presented in three major groups showing the influence of receptors, p-AKT and
p-ERK on the nodes in the network.

(D) Marginal edge probability table for low PI3K data, late dynamics.
3.4.1. Influence of Total Receptor Levels
As seen from Figure 6A, most of the molecules show positive and strong correlation with the
receptor in the early and late time zones of both conditions. This indicates that the receptor is
positively influencing the downstream molecules. It is interesting to note that the correlation is
heavily dependent on the interaction with parallel pathways. For example, presence of high PI3K
weakens the correlation between the receptors and downstream molecules both in the early and late
time points. Suppression of PI3K significantly increases most of the correlation coefficients.
3.4.2. Intracellular Regulation by p-AKT
As shown from Figure 6B, p-AKT shows negative correlation with the p-SMAD2,3 molecules
in the high PI3K condition. Among the p-SMADs, the correlation is stronger for p-SMAD3. The

212
correlation is weak in the low PI3K case and from the DBNs, it is seen that edges from p-AKT to
p-SMADs are absent in this condition. Therefore our results show that in the low PI3K condition,
although the p-AKT levels increase to basal levels at later time points, the influence of p-AKT on
p-SMADs is lost. A mostly negative correlation is also seen between the p-AKT and t-SMAD and
positive correlation between p-AKT and the receptors in the DBNs. For p-ERK, DBN analysis
showed regulation by p-AKT. Correlation coefficients show that the regulation is negative in the
early time zone and positive in the late time zone.

Figure 6. Correlation tables for high and low PI3K condition. (A) Receptor mediated
regulation; (B) p-AKT mediated regulation; (C) p-ERK mediated regulation. The
Pearson correlation is calculated between the parent nodes at time step (t í 1) and all
other nodes at time step t. The early time points 0.5, 1, 1.5 h (both conditions) and the
late time points correspond to 6, 12, and 18 for high PI3K and 12, 18, 24 for low PI3K.
The average correlation coefficients across 2 repeats (selected in Figure 3) are used for
high and low PI3K. However, for the low PI3K late time points, only repeat 3 is used.
3.4.3. Intracellular Regulation by p-ERK
The consensus DBNs from all the conditions showed that p-ERK has a minor role in regulating
the levels of most molecules. The influence if it exists is mainly for the low PI3K condition as seen
from some samples in this condition. Based on correlation analysis, the correlation coefficients are
weak in the high PI3K condition (Figure 6C). But, comparatively stronger correlation coefficients
are seen in the low PI3K condition. The type of regulation is however mixed. The correlation with
p-SMAD2 is positive in the early time zone and negative in the late time zone. The correlation with
p-SMAD3 and t-SMAD4 are negative. In the early low PI3K condition, p-ERK shows a positive
correlation with p-AKT.

3.5. Network Regulation during Endoderm Differentiation
This work is the first account in identifying specific signaling interactions governing endoderm
differentiation of hESCs using network analysis tools. The DBNs inferred for the high and low
PI3K data accomplished two major tasks: (1) They identified molecular interactions within the
TGF-ȕ pathway along-with crosstalk interactions with parallel pathways; and (2) They identified
distinct pathway regulations during the early and late phases of the signaling dynamics. One key
prediction from the entire analysis is the influence of receptor levels on downstream molecules
including SMAD, AKT and ERK. In the canonical pathway, TGFȕRII is known to activate SMAD
molecules after formation of the ligand-receptor complex [35]. TGFȕ signaling also participates in
several non-canonical signaling leading to activation of PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK pathways in
many cell lines [35,36]. Our analysis indicates that the levels of the receptors (TGFȕRII) are still in
the regime where they are limiting and any change in their level is reflected downstream. In
addition, it is interesting to note that in each repeat, we repeatedly obtain the receptor-mediated
edges, indicating that the connections are maintained in spite of sample variability.
Several important interactions from p-AKT were identified indicating the existence of p-AKT
mediated crosstalk in high PI3K condition and its removal under low PI3K. Ours is the first
systematic study to identify these crosstalk interactions in differentiating hESCs. The regulation of
p-SMAD3 by p-AKT is well known in other cell lines, mainly inhibition of p-SMAD3
phosphorylation by mTORC1 and sequestration of non-phospho SMAD3 by p-AKT [37–41]. The
regulation of p-SMAD2 by p-AKT is observed only in one sample of the high PI3K condition
(Figure S5). Literature shows that most negative regulation of p-AKT is on p-SMAD3 and not
p-SMAD2 [39], however some reports indicate negative regulation of both p-SMAD2 and p-SMAD3
by p-AKT in neuroblastoma and CHO cell lines [42,43]. The removal of crosstalk interactions with
p-AKT in the low PI3K condition is interesting although the actual mechanism needs further study.
One possibility is that the SMADs have undergone predominant nuclear translocation under
inhibition of p-AKT and p-SMAD is no longer accessible to p-AKT [37,38,40]. The regulation of
the receptors and t-SMAD4 by p-AKT was also seen but these interactions are not as widely
studied as those of p-AKT and p-SMADs.
The DBNs showed regulation of p-ERK by p-AKT in the high PI3K condition. It is well
reported that p-ERK is inhibited by p-AKT and many of its downstream effectors (via mTORC1)
in multiple cell lines [44]. Previous study has shown the interaction between AKT1 and cRAF in
hESCs leading to inhibition of RAF/MEK/ERK signaling [17]. Our experiments show that the
levels of p-ERK are higher in low PI3K condition and the influence of p-AKT on p-ERK is also
absent from the low PI3K DBNs. This indicates that this interaction negatively influences
endoderm induction. However, a positive correlation was seen between p-ERK and p-AKT in the
early low PI3K condition. ERK is known to influence the AKT pathway based on the context [44]
indicating that this interaction may be seen during endoderm differentiation via additional networks
interactions in these pathways.

4. Conclusions
Network inference is an area of active research in systems biology, with a multitude of methods
currently being explored, starting from correlative and clustering methods to more involved
algorithms utilizing Boolean, Bayesian and Differential Equation frameworks [45–50]. Many
attempts to compare different approaches have led to the conclusion that there is no true gold
standard method currently available that can identify all true positive connections (those present
and inferred) with minimal false positive (not present but inferred) and false negative (present and
not inferred) connections [51,52]. During benchmarking tests on in silico signal transduction
dataset to check the network reconstruction accuracy of the DBN algorithm used in this work,
Grzegorczyk et al. obtained favorable values for several measures of accuracy for datasets with
wide range of signal to noise ratio (SNR) [25,32] and these measures were comparable to other
methods for similar node numbers, connectivity and SNR [51]. Due to the success on a variety of
datasets, the algorithm by Grzegorczyk et al. was used to determine the network connections in this
work. Significant care was taken to infer connections from independent repeats of the same
experimental condition due to high variability of the system and emphasis was given to most
repeated connections across independent repeats. While current analysis indicates robustness of the
predictions across independent repeats, verification of such robustness is only possible by running
selective perturbation experiments [53,54], which will be considered in our future work.
Precise control of differentiation of hESCs is a difficult problem due to the high variability and
multiple signaling mediators associated with this process. While experiments have identified
features of signal transduction that orchestrate this process, rational design using network level
properties is not well studied. This work is an important contribution in this direction. Using
network analysis methods, we uncovered signaling interactions existing amongst the common
mediators of endoderm differentiation of hESCs. One of the most common predictions across all
conditions and repeats was that the receptor levels are most influential in governing the
downstream pathway molecules in most cases. The TGF-ȕRII levels correlated well with the
canonical and non-canonical molecules. The influence of receptor levels on downstream signals
provides an avenue to understand the origins of variability that is common in hESC system and it is
reasonable to expect that cell-to-cell variability in receptor levels will lead to variability of
downstream signals and eventually cell fate specification. In mouse ES cells, it was previously
shown that variability in the activity of TGF-ȕ pathway (Activin/Nodal and BMP) controlled the
variability in the level of pluripotency marker, NANOG, in the self-renewal state and modulation of
receptor activity using small molecule inhibitors influenced the heterogeneity of NANOG in
subpopulations [55].
A significant observation was the strong crosstalk interactions of p-AKT with the mediators of
TGF-ȕ pathway during Activin induction condition and complete removal of any of these
interactions under PI3K inhibition. The introduction of p-AKT mediated interactions and their
removal is captured in the independent repeats of the high and low PI3K conditions. Importantly,
p-AKT levels could not be continuously suppressed experimentally by continued inhibition of
PI3K pathway, and it regained its basal expression. However in spite of the increase in p-AKT

215
expression levels, the correlation remained weak with most molecules like p-SMAD2,3 and
p-ERK, indicating continued removal of crosstalk. This is counter-intuitive and demonstrates the
necessity of network level analysis to comprehend experimental data, in particular for such complex
and dynamic systems. The influence of p-AKT on p-ERK was seen in the high PI3K condition.
Report from Dalton Lab has shown increases in p-ERK under p-AKT inhibition in hESCs leading to
activation of WNT signaling supporting endoderm differentiation [17]. This can explain the increase
in p-ERK levels under PI3K inhibition in our system. In addition, a weaker regulatory role for
p-ERK was predicted in the high PI3K condition, with some enhancement under the low PI3K
condition. Possibility of p-ERK mediated interactions under low PI3K signaling is interesting. It is
known that p-ERK has additional roles in linker phosphorylation of SMAD molecules which can
affect the nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling and ultimately their dynamics as modeled by Liu et al. in
this issue of the journal [56]. This could be the reason for seeing increasing p-ERK influence on
SMAD molecules under low PI3K condition in some samples. But, since this was observed in only
some samples of low PI3K that used the entire time series information, additional investigation
needs to be done. Future studies of long-term p-ERK dynamics (>24 h) and perturbation
experiments will enable further exploration of this portion of the network. Overall, the identified
DBNs demonstrate significant biologically relevant interactions. Such agreement with literature
observations along with prediction of additional interactions prove the applicability of quantitative
methods for teasing out the network level properties of complex systems like hESCs.
Another important result from DBN analysis was inference of time zones (change-points) where
the network parameters changed thereby, indicating an adaptive nature of the network. The nature
of the data indicated multiple change-points, with two major change-points in the early and late
phases of the dynamics. Application of DBN analysis in the early and late segments showed that
the early dynamics is more informative and could adequately identify the network inferred by using
the entire time series. This hints at the importance of measuring early dynamics of signal
transduction. Further, the late time segments showed strong influence of the receptors levels on
other molecules with weaker influence of any crosstalk interaction. It was also seen that the
performance of the DBN algorithm in each time zone was better when the number of time points
was increased. However, there was no change in the most representative connections, but it enabled
loss of some less represented connections.
We recognize that the additional interactions identified here require further testing by
perturbation experiments. Further, the interactions identified by DBN need not be direct
associations from a biological standpoint, but the resulting effect via intermediated processes. The
interacting molecules are solely dependent on the molecules tracked in the experiments. These
observations, however, need further investigation in hESCs. An important point to note is that
DBN analysis is a useful tool to generate hypothesis based on existing experimental data. The
identified networks can inform future experimentation and the network themselves may undergo
refinement, a common workflow in systems biology. Hypotheses provided by DBNs can be
utilized by detailed modeling approaches like differential equations to investigate the kinetics of
the process.
