Preface
Immediately after the first drafts of the human genome sequence were reported almost
a decade ago, the importance of genomics and functional genomics studies became
well recognized across the broad disciplines of biological sciences research. The
initiatives of Leroy Hood and other pioneers on developing systems biology
approaches for evaluating or addressing global and integrated biological activities,
mechanisms, and network systems have motivated many of us, as bioscientists, to reexamine or revisit a whole spectrum of our previous experimental findings or
observations in a much broader, link-seeking and cross-talk context. Soon thereafter,
these lines of research efforts generated interesting, fancy and sometimes misleading
new names for the now well-accepted “omics” research areas, including functional
genomics, (functional) proteomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics, glycomics,
lipidomics, and cellomics. It may be interesting for us to try to relate these “omics”
approaches to one of the oldest omics studies that we all may be quite familiar with,
and that is “economics”, in a way that all “omics” indeed seemed to have meant to
address the mechanisms/activities/constituents in a global, inter-connected and
regulated way or manner.
The advancement of a spectrum of technological methodologies and assay systems for
various omics studies has been literally astonishing, including next-generation DNA
sequencing platforms, whole transcriptome microarrays, micro-RNA arrays, various
protein chips, polysaccharide or glycomics arrays, advanced LC-MS/MS, GC-MS/MS,
MALDI-TOF, 2D-NMR, FT-IR, and other systems for proteome and metabolome
research and investigations on related molecular signaling and networking
bioactivities. Even more excitingly and encouragingly, many outstanding researchers
previously trained as mathematicians, information or computation scientists have
courageously re-educated themselves and turned into a new generation of
bioinformatics scientists. The collective achievements and breakthroughs made by our
colleagues have created a number of wonderful database systems which are now
routinely and extensively used by not only young but also “old” researchers. It is very
difficult to miss the overwhelming feeling and excitement of this new era in systems
biology and computational biology research.
It is now estimated, with good supporting evidence by omics information, that there
are approximately 25,000 genes in the human genome, about 45,000 total proteins in
the human proteome, and around 3000 species of primary and between 3000 and 6000

X

Preface

species of secondary metabolites, respectively, in the human body fluid/tissue
metabolome. These numbers and their relative levels to each other are now helping us
to construct a more comprehensive and realistic view of human biology systems.
Likewise, but maybe to a lesser extent, various baseline omics databases on mouse,
fruit fly, Arabidopsis plant, yeast, and E. coli systems are being built to serve as model
systems for molecular, cellular and systems biology studies; these efforts are projected
to result in very interesting and important research findings in the coming years.
Good findings in a new research area may not necessarily translate quickly into good
or high-impact benefits pertaining to socio-economic needs, as may be witnessed now
by many of us with regard to research and development in omics science/technology.
To some of us, the new genes, novel protein functions, unique metabolite profiles or
PCA clusters, and their signaling systems that we have so far revealed seemed to have
yielded less than what we have previously (only some 5 to 10 years ago) expected, in
terms of new targets or strategies for drug or therapeutics development in medical
sciences, or for improvement of crop plants in agricultural science. Nonetheless, some
useful new tools for diagnosis and personalized medicine have been developed as a
result of genomics research. Recent reviews on this subject have helped us more
realistically and still optimistically to address such issues in a socially responsible
academic exercise. Therefore, whereas some “microarray” or “bioinformatics”
scientists among us may have been criticized as doing “cataloging research”, the
majority of us believe that we are sincerely exploring new scientific and technological
systems to benefit human health, human food and animal feed production, and
environmental protections. Indeed, we are humbled by the complexity, extent and
beauty of cross-talks in various biological systems; on the other hand, we are
becoming more educated and are able to start addressing honestly and skillfully the
various important issues concerning translational medicine, global agriculture, and the
environment.
I am very honored to serve as the editor of these two volumes on Systems and
Computational Biology: (I) Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems, and (II)
Bioinformatics and Computational Modeling. I believe that we have collectively
contributed a series of high-quality research or review articles in a timely fashion to
this emerging research field of our scientific community.
I sincerely hope that our colleagues and readers worldwide will help us in future
similar efforts, by providing us feedback in the form of critical comments,
interdisciplinary ideas and innovative suggestions on our book chapters, as a way to
pay our high respect to the biological genomes on planet earth.

1. Introduction
Development of massively parallel “next generation” sequencing technology (NGS) has
dramatically revolutionized biological studies. Among the many applications of NGS, RNASeq is one of the most important uses of this technology. RNA-Seq enables investigators to
accurately probe the current state of a transcriptome and assess many biologically important
issues, such as; gene expression levels, differential splicing events, and allele-specific gene
expression. Compared with previous technologies (e.g., microarrays, etc.) NGS has the clear
advantage of not being limited to experimental systems having well characterized genomes
or transcript sequence libraries. This positions RNA-seq approaches as important and
versatile techniques for experimental systems and species where specific genetic
information may be limited or altogether lacking.
A major goal of most transcriptomic studies is the identification and characterization of all
transcripts within a developmental stage or specific tissue. NGS techniques have made the
massive amount of data required to carry out such studies both inexpensive and available to
an unprecedented extent. Clever computer algorithms have made the assembly of these
massive data sets the work of one or two people with reasonably powerful workstations or a
moderate analytical server.
Once a reference transcriptome has been assembled, analyses can be carried out that involve
several steps, such as; mapping short sequence reads to transcriptome, quantifying the
abundance of genes or gene sets, and comparing differential expression patterns among all
samples. Herein we outline the processes from obtaining raw short read data to advanced
comparative gene expression analysis and we review bioinformatic programs currently
available, such as Tophat, Cufflinks, DESeq, that are specifically designed to address each of
the above steps. We will discuss both accuracy and ease of use of these tools by biologists
beginning to pursue these types of analyses. In addition to individual programs, we will
also discuss integration of multiple programs into pipelines for more rapid and complete
expression analyses. Overall, the future applications of RNA-Seq will open new avenues for
transcriptome analyses of less well-studied and/or wild caught species that could not have
previously been approached. This will yield a wealth of new comparative data highlighting
the many ways plants and animals have developed to survive in this rapidly changing
environment.

2. De Novo sequence assembly and expression analysis with NGS data
There are many phases to an NGS research project where the end goal is expression analysis
in a non-model organism. This chapter is dedicated to the many phases and options
available to the researcher. In general however, bioinformatic analyses at some point begin
with gathering raw sequence data from a biological sample of interest and having it
sequenced. The raw data will often need to be filtered for quality. If any pre-existing
sequences are available from a closely related species, their use as a reference should be
considered, but is not necessary. Assembling the short reads derived from one or more of
the NGS platforms comes next, but should not be considered a definitive, terminal process.
Most frequently assembly of short read data entails an iterative refinement phase in which a
wide range of parameters are modified in the search for a sufficiently contiguous and
complete assembly. Analyzing the assembly can entail searching for signatures of assembly
errors and trying to identify the assembled contigs. Once a satisfactory group of transcripts
is produced they are locked for the expression level analysis. Mapping the short reads to the
assembled transcripts is the first step in assessing gene expression levels. The next is
determining the expression levels of each contig based on the number of short reads
mapped to it. Generally a comparative gene expression analysis will follow in which two or
more samples are compared and alternate regulation patterns or profiles determined. We
end the chapter with a specialized comparative expression study in F1 hybrid organisms in
which differential expression may reveal evolutionary divergence in gene regulation
mechanisms.
2.1 Next-generation sequencing
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques produce millions of reads per run but each
read may be as short as 25 bp. Using NGS allows one to apply complex samples (i.e., total
DNA or RNA libraries) on the NGS instrument. These mixed samples contain fragments of
larger molecule targets sheared to some pre-set fragment length distribution. NGS
techniques allow the sequencing of completely unknown samples in a massively parallel
fashion. In order to perform massively parallel sequencing most NGS instruments require a
run time of days to weeks in carefully controlled conditions for complete data acquisition.
There are many competing technologies, and new challengers are in constant development
to increase both the speed and quantity of NGS per sample run. It is beyond the scope of
this chapter to examine all of the current and upcoming techniques so we will briefly focus
on two most common NGS instruments currently in use: the Illumina Genome Analyzer
and ABI SOLiD platforms. Each of these platforms has its strengths and weaknesses that are
very important to understand when designing research strategies.
2.1.1 The ABI SOLiD platform
The SOLiD system produces short sequencing lengths (i.e., termed “reads”) ranging from 35
to 75 bp and has run times of between one and seven days depending on the amount and
type of reads desired. Typically, instruments will have 6 or 12 independent lanes available
per run and samples can be multiplexed in each of those for up to 96 unique barcodes.
Product literature states the daily sequencing throughput is between 10-30 Gbp.
The SOLiD sequencing process begins by fragmenting high molecular weight DNA into
smaller fragments to be sequenced (Fig 1A). Fragments are size selected in a narrow range,
typically around 200 bp, and primers are ligated to both ends of the fragments (Fig 1A).

Glass beads coated with complimentary primers are mixed with the fragments (Fig 1A) and
emulsified in such manner that an aqueous droplet will contain a single bead and a single
fragment along with the biochemistry necessary for PCR (Fig 1B). Several rounds of
emulsion PCR later each bead is coated with sequences identical to the original fragment
(Fig 1B). The DNA coated beads are then released from the emulsion, and washed into tiny
wells in a plate sized to admit a single bead per well (Fig 1B). Finally the cyclic sequencing
phase begins during which each position is iteratively read (Fig 1C).

Fig. 1. A simplified outline of the ABI SOLiD sequencing procedure. A) Sample preparation
and the addition of glass beads decorated with primers. B) Emulsion PCR amplifies a single
template so that its copies are primed by primers bound to a glass bead. C) The sequencing
reaction repeats through five extension cycles where the primers are offset by one position
in each cycle so that each position in the template is interrogated twice.
The most distinctive feature of SOLiD data is the fact that during the sequencing phase
nucleotides are added in dinucleotide probes. In each cycle a nucleotide pentamer is added
in which the two 5’ bases are determined by the attached dye (Fig 1C). Once the plate is
imaged, the dye is removed leaving the newly added pentamer (Fig 1C). Each cycle therafter

6

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

interrogates two more bases offset by three positions from the previous cycle (Fig 1C). As
the growing fragment reaches the desired length the entire fragment is washed off and a
new primer bound at an offset of one so that a different set of bases are interrogated as this
new strand grows (Fig 1C). This process is repeated five times, each one offset by one base
from the last so that each position is ultimately interrogated twice (Fig 1C).
Four fluorescent dyes are used but each dye can be carried by one of four nucleotide dimers.
As each color is read, the recorded data corresponds to a sequence of colors coded by 0, 1, 2,
or 3; this is called color-space. This arrangement means that for any given string of numbers
there are four possible nucleotide sequences that it may encode. Given knowledge of the
first base it is possible to determine the most likely nucleotide sequence encoded by the
entire read. However, to do this prior to assembly of the reads into contiguous sequences
(i.e., contigs) for comparison or alignment to a reference genome would result in losing the
advantage of SOliD’s built-in error checking (afforded by reading each base twice). For
example, If a read was determined to possess a position that does not match a consensus
reference sequence, it would be ambiguous in other technology platforms whether it were a
real difference or sequencing error. With the double-coverage afforded by SOLiD colorspace the same “error“ is not likely to be made twice in subsequent cycles and it is much
more likely that a real variation has been identified instead of a sequencing error.
It should be noted the SOLiD color-space, in which short reads are reported, can be difficult
to work with for some assembly applications. Most assembly programs are initially
designed to work with nucleotides and require special pre- and post-processing programs to
properly assemble color-space reads and these are not always available. Many, but not all, of
the specialized alignment programs that can align short reads to a reference library are also
able to handle color-space reads but require special options to be enabled.
2.1.2 The illumina genome analyzer platform
The Genome Analyzer (GA) platform typically produces read lengths in the range of 35-150
bp and requires 2 to 14 days for a sequencing run depending on the amount of data desired.
Each flow cell contains 8 lanes each of which can produce 80 million reads or more. Daily
throughput is estimated at 6.5 Gb for a run in which both ends of fragments (i.e., paired
end) are sequenced to 100bp.
The Illumina process also begins by shearing sample DNA (or cDNA) into fragments that
are size selected in a target range, often around 200 bp (Fig 2A). These fragments then
have short adaptors ligated to both ends of the sample fragments such that unique primer
sequences are ligated to either end (Fig 2A). The fragments are then washed onto the flow
cell that has sequences complimentary to the two unique primers bound to its surface (Fig
2A). The concentration of fragments on the flow cell is controlled such that they bind
sparsely enough on the surface to be optically distinguished from neighboring fragments.
Template sequences are only bound by base-paring to primers covalently bound to the
flow cell. An initial PCR step produces a complimentary copy of the template now
covalently bound to the flow cell, and following this the original template is removed by
washing.
The next steps (Fig 2B) are repeated several times to produce a colony of copies of the
sequence via ‘bridge’ PCR. The free end of the template pairs with one of the primers
covalently bound to the flow cell and a PCR cycle produces a new copy bound by one end to
the flow cell a short distance from the first. After several bridge PCR cycles, a cluster of
copies is built up around the originally bound sequence.

and attachment to the flow cell. B) Bridge PCR amplifies each bound fragment producing a
cluster of copies. C) The sequencing reaction extends the growing strand by one nucleotide,
excites attached fluorophores which are read optically, and removes the terminator and
fluorescent dye before repeating with the next nucleotide.
When spots have reached sufficient density to produce clear signals (Fig 2C) the cyclic
sequencing reaction can begin. One of the two unique primers is attached to the free ends
and nucleotide addition cycles commence. Each nucleotide contains a different fluorescent
reporter tag and a reversible terminator. During each cycle all four bases are flowed onto the
reaction chamber, but since each contains a replication terminator only a single one can be
incorporated into any elongating sequence (Fig 2C). Laser sources excite the fluorescent
reporter of the added nucleotide and an optical sensor detects the wavelength of light
emitted. The color of each spot is tracked with each cycle and interpreted directly as a
nucleotide base (Fig 2C). This cycle is repeated until the reads reach the desired length and
the entire sequencing process is then repeated using the other unique primer to sequence the
complementary copies of the DNA.

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

We have briefly covered two popular NGS sequencing techniques to introduce the
capabilities of the technologies and what types of data are produced. There are several other
sequencing technologies and many recent reviews covering them are available (Metzker,
2009; Voelkerding et al., 2009; Bräutigam and Gowik, 2010; Nowrousian, 2010). The reader is
encouraged to seek out the latest reviews as these technologies are advancing with immense
speed and published information quickly becomes outdated.
2.2 Sequence assembly algorithms
When the human genome project first began capillary sequencing base on Sanger
technology was the primary sequencing tool employed (Lander et al., 2001). It was
extremely labor intensive yet at the time an amazing amount of sequence data was being
produced. The Sanger reads produced where about 700 bp in length. Some current NGS
techniques are now able to produce reads close to this length, while others hold the promise
of producing several hundreds to thousands of base pair length reads.

Table 1. Several overlap assembly programs.
The basic strategy for assembling sequences of this length is to use an overlap graph. In
an overlap graph nodes represent whole reads and connections represent overlap
between the reads. In this case the reads are large and a significant amount of unique
information is held in each overlap. Many repetitive features and similar sequence
properties that would stymie a short read assembler are easily resolved by long reads and
an overlap strategy. Still, assembly problems are not trivial and many packages have
continued to mature and acquire a variety of tools. A listing of overlap-based assemblers
is given in Table 1.
2.2.1 De Bruijn graph assemblers
As NGS data became available it was quickly apparent that new algorithms were needed to
assemble the very short sequences being produced. This problem was addressed by
application of discoveries made independently by both De Bruijn and Good in 1946 (de
Bruijn, 1946; Good, 1946). All of the most successful short sequence assembly programs in
use today utilize the De Bruijn graph as a central data structure and then leverage other
aspects of the data to improve upon the assembly process.
The first step in a De Bruijn based assembler is to build the graph. To do so, each short read
is broken into k-mers where k is a pre-defined integer length; each k-mer will be a node in

Gene Expression Analysis Using
RNA-Seq from Organisms Lacking Substantial Genomic Resources

9

the graph (Fig 3A). The k-mers are defined by recording the sequence in a window of size k
and sliding that window down by one position for the length of the short read – producing a
new k-mer at each position (Fig 3A). If a short read has a length of L, it will contribute L-k+1
k-mers to the graph. The number of occurrences of each k-mer is also counted and will come
into play in a subsequent step.

Fig. 3. Outline of a De Bruijn graph based assembler
The edges (or connections between nodes) represent a k-1 overlap between the connected
nodes. Thus, we see that each node can have 8 possible connections (Fig 3B). Connections
are recorded as they are observed in the raw read data. As reads are passed into the graph
building algorithm discrete seed graphs begin to expand and are joined as the reads
connecting them are found. In the end several thousand discrete, internally connected
graphs exist in the working memory of the computer. An idealized example of one is given
in Fig 3C. This is a very simple example but several complicating features are represented
here. At this stage a simplified graph can be constructed in which linear stretches
(underlined in green in Fig 3C) are condensed into nodes and edges are still k-1 overlaps.
The resulting simplified graph is given in Fig 3D, and some of the problems can begin to be

10

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

addressed. The leftmost is a ‘tip’; a dead end likely caused by a sequencing error near the
beginning or end of a short read. A bubble is also present in the center of the graph
indicating two alternative possible paths through the k-mer space are present in the short
read data. This also could be the result of a sequencing error or a genuine sequence variant.
The depth of coverage for each simplified node is indicated by a red number above each
node. This information can be used to trim off any tips and remove bubbles with low
coverage. Higher coverage anomalies may merit incorporation into alternately assembled
contigs depending on the application.
The right-most feature in this graph is a cyclic node. This creates a problem for short read
assemblers when repetitive sequence regions are encountered. It could be the sequence has
only 4 guanines in a row, or 40, it is impossible to tell from the information generated. This
sort of assembly problem is more difficult to resolve by addressing coverage alone and
usually results in breaks in contigs. Paired-end information can rescue some of these
repetitive situations but scaffold contigs may be broken for many other reasons as well.
However, if sufficient paired-end sequences are available that join two contigs it is possible
to estimate the size of the gap between them given the expected fragment size (Fig 3E).
One major practical drawback of De Bruijn graph based assemblers is the amount of
memory (RAM) required to build, and traverse the graph during an assembly. For example,
the Velvet assembler package may require use of 70-100 GB of physical memory to build a
vertebrate transcriptome assembly from 100 million reads. Although single machines with
such large amounts of memory are not as rare and expensive as they once were, they remain
somewhat difficult to find and gain access to. There are several assembler packages that
have attempted to address this requirement for large memory. For example, a distributed
approach has been implemented in the Abyss assembler and this spreads the workload
across several nodes in a computer cluster. Optimizations in the SOAPdenovo package first
seek to reduce the amount of memory required by attempting to correct erroneous k-mers
produced by sequencing errors. In one study, this approach allowed the number of 25-mers
in an assembly of the human genome to be reduced from 14.6 billion to 5.0 billion (Li et al.,
2010a).
An alternative to purchasing computer capability with very large memory is use of a cloud
computing services, such as the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (aws.amazon.com/ec2/).
For a fee, computer time is available in dynamically generated computing environments.
Several instance types are available including some with up to 68.4 GB of memory and two
cluster instance types optimized for traditional compute nodes or GPU nodes. While no
assembly process has yet been reported as having used this resource several similarly
complex analyses have reported favorable experiences (Afgan et al., 2010; Di Tommaso et
al., 2010; Wall et al., 2010).

2.3 Overview of sequence assembly process
We have discussed the basic workings of assembly algorithms in order to provide a
foundation for further discussion of assembly and the effects that different choices can have
on the outcome. We now turn to a larger view of the practical assembly process. At each
step we will give recommendations based on our experience and mention other sources for
information and help.
2.3.1 Sequence filtration
Prior to NGS read assembly it can be beneficial to remove reads that are more likely to carry
erroneous sequences. This is most important for De Bruijn graph based assemblers because
each erroneous base call creates up to k erroneous nodes in memory. Thus, large data sets can
very quickly exceed even very large memory systems. There are many types of sequencing
errors that may need to be removed and some are unique to certain types of techniques. For
example, sample DNA can become contaminated by bacterial or vector sequences and so
screening reads against appropriate libraries can help to remove some of these contaminants.
Short reads produced by the Illumina GA platform tend to decrease in quality as they are
lengthened as well as have an increased error rate in the first few bases. To deal with this
some tools (built in options in BWA and Bowtie short read alignment programs) will
allow one to trim all reads by a certain length from either end in a set after measuring
average quality scores across a read set. Other tools such as the FASTX-Toolkit
(hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/) are more adaptive and deal with each read
individually. Another strategy that attempts to correct short reads is to enumerate all the
k-mers defined by a set and modify those with very low occurrence frequencies (Schröder
et al., 2009; Li et al., 2010b; Shi et al., 2010). Few papers primarily address this issue but
the quality of the final assembly can only be as good as data you begin with.

2.3.2 Use of a reference library
Reference sequences can be used in many ways to aid in assembly. The most straight
forward is to map reads onto a set of closely related reference sequences (using a tool such
as BWA, Bowtie, Tophat, etc. section 2.4), then derive a consensus sequence from the reads
aligned to each reference sequence. Among others, the samtools pileup or mpileup tools can
aid in this approach. This limits the resulting sequences to the set of previously known
reference sequences but that is not necessarily a problem. The Cufflinks tool is a unique take
on reference based assembly. It is specifically designed to find exons and intron-exon
junctions by mapping transcript sequence to a reference genome.
Reference sequences can also be used to guide a de novo assembly. It is possible there are
other tools which enable this procedure but here we describe the use of the Columbus
extension in the Velvet package. In this case short reads are again aligned with a separate
tool to reference sequences which may be genome or transcript seqeunces. The resulting
alignment file and reference sequences are then given as input to Velvet which will initially
carry out its de novo assembly process as normal. The reference sequences are treated in a
sense as long reads and are used to scaffold together appropriate contigs that resulted from
the initial assembly process. This technique uses known sequences to extend assembled
contigs while also allowing for the discovery of novel sequences.
2.3.3 Sequence assembly
While many NGS assembly packages utilize the De Bruijn graph to represent k-mer
connectivity, each has a slightly different algorithm to traverse the graph, prune it, and
extract contigs. Most of the freely-available, academically-developed assembly packages
have extensive manuals and, more importantly, active communities of users and
developers. An extensive listing of the settings and options that can be modified in even one
of these packages is far beyond the scope of this discussion. Some considerations however
transcend all of these software packages and are discussed here.
The selection of k (k-mer size or hash length) will have a huge impact on assembly. Short kmers allow for the assembly of low coverage regions since for any two reads to be linked in
k-mer space they must overlap by at least k-1. Conversely a too-short k-mer size could allow
contigs to be linked in k-mer-space which are not truly linked; thus leading to a chimeric
assembly. Very high k-mer sizes significantly cut down on chimeric contigs but impair the
assembly of low expression level transcripts and reduce the contiguity overall. A good
approach is to scan a range of k-mer sizes and compare the results of several assemblies to
determine a k-mer size that gives the best balance.
Another important parameter to consider is how the assembler uses the coverage levels to
assemble contigs. In Velvet, for example, the minimum coverage cutoff and expected
coverage parameters define a range of coverage levels to consider. This is fine for genomic
sequences where coverage levels should be much more consistent, but is extremely
problematic for transcript assembly. The Oases extension in Velvet is designed to adapt to
varying coverage depth levels and is allowed to report alternative contigs instead of
selecting only high coverage paths through the graph.
The diverse range of De Bruijn graph-based assemblers each take different approaches to
traversing the graph and pre- and post-processing the data. Software documentation is an
excellent place to begin to understand the various assembly parameter modifications and
settings allowed. As previously mentioned most of the academically developed packages
have an associated community that communicate via e-mail listserv (many of which are
archived online) or internet forum.

2.3.4 Assessing assembly quality
This is likely to be the most challenging step in an assembly. A set of basic statistics that are
often seen in literature are the N50 value, overall length, number of contigs, and largest
contig. The N50 is the length-weighted median length. Another way to think about it is to
say that at the N50 length, half of the length in the set of assembled contigs is in contigs
equal to or shorter than this value. It is a measure of contiguity since the N50 length
increases as sequence length is shifted into longer contigs. The overall length is simply the
sum of the lengths of all contigs, and the number of contigs and largest contig are selfexplanatory. These are basic statistics often seen in literature but they are fairly limited in
assessing assembly quality.
It is generally desirable to quantify correctly assembled contigs, but this is a very tricky thing
to do especially with novel transcriptomes. There is no one good approach to assess this easily
so we will present several and discuss advantages and disadvantages of each. One approach is
to use BLAST or other similarity search tool to compare the assembly to a well-annotated
transcriptome of a closely related species if available or a large curated set like the nonredundant (nr) database maintained by the NCBI. A tool like Blast2Go (Conesa et al., 2005;
Conesa and Götz, 2008; Götz et al., 2008) can be used to analyze the BLAST results and select a
good match for each contig. Trying to maximize unique hits may be a useful indicator but the
annotation by BLAST may give different results for alternate splice forms.
Another useful metric is to measure how completely a reference transcriptome from a
closely related species is covered by the assembled contigs. This depends heavily on the
quality of the reference transcriptome and may not tell very much about the contiguity of
the assembled contigs.
A third indication that contigs have been properly assembled is their ability to map to a
reference genome. A tool like gmap (Wu and Watanabe, 2005; Wu and Nacu, 2010) can
quickly map a large set of contigs to a large genome and report its results in a variety of
formats including some basic statistics for each mapping. This would seem like the best
method but some software development may be necessary to extract full meaning from such
an alignment.
Analyzing the assembly often leads to another round of refinement possibly reaching all the
way back to doing more sequencing. More stringent or different filtering, replacing the
reference with the assembled contigs, or modifying assembler settings can all help to refine
an assembly. Usually this process continues until a ‘good enough’ transcriptome is reached
and that is defined by each researcher for their specific needs.
2.4 RNA short read mapping
After a reference transcriptome or background genome sequence has been efficiently
assembled, the next step in many experimental designs is to accurately map RNA-seq reads
derived from specific cell or organisms states to it as a method to profile global gene
expression (Fig 5). Generally speaking, programs designed for EST mapping [i.e., MUMmer
and BLAT(Kent, 2002; Kurtz et al., 2004)] are suitable for reads generated from Roche 454
platfoms, but are not nearly efficient enough for use with short reads generated by Illumina
Gene Analyzer or ABI SOLiD NGS platforms. Alignment algorithms designed specifically for
NGS short reads are necessary to map reads from latter two platforms. Over the past two
years, a wide variety of different programs have been developed to meet the challenge of
efficiently mapping millions of short reads and the number of available programs seems to be
continuously growing. The challenge for biological scientists is how to choose the best

14

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

program that is optimally suited to their specific project. Table 3 shows five currently popular
programs available for short read mapping that will be evaluated herein.

Fig. 5. RNA-Seq project pipeline and commonly used programs. (see;
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sequence_alignment_software#ShortRead_Sequence_Alignment)
To evaluate these programs, we used an X. maculatus reference transcriptome [for
description of the species see section 2.7 and (Walter and Kazianis, 2001; Kallman and
Kazianis, 2006; Meierjohann and Schartl, 2006)] built from over 200 million paired-end reads
sequenced from the brain, heart, and liver tissues of mature individuals using the Illumina
GAIIx platform (Expression Analysis® Inc. Durham, NC). We used the Velvet assembly
package (Zerbino and Birney, 2008) to integrate the combined read set with a hash length (kmer size) of 43. Oases (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~zerbino/oases/) was used to perform the
final assembly and resulted in a final transcriptome having 110,604 transcripts with an
average length of 2,197 bp, and a total size of 243 Mb. In addition, we employed 34 million
60 bp paired-end reads (GAIIx, no custom filtration) sequenced from RNA isolated from X.
maculatus liver tissue and mapped them back to the reference transcriptome described above
to test and compare all five programs in terms of RAM usage, computing time and mapping
sensitivity (e.g., the percent of mapped reads).
As shown in the Table 3, the five different programs required different amount of RAM and
produced different mapping efficiencies. Bowtie is currently one of the most popular
mapping programs and has a reputation for very rapid mapping speeds. It employs a
Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) and full-text minute-space index (for review of

Gene Expression Analysis Using

15

alignment algorithms, see (Li and Homer, 2010), which greatly reduces both the memory
usage and computational time. In our test, Bowtie proved to be the fastest mapping
program and also used a modest amount of RAM. The small RAM usage and speed of
Bowtie allows it to run on a standard desktop computer. However, Bowtie’s fast
performance speed is not without cost. Bowtie only allows non-gapped alignments between
reads and references, thus sacrificing some sensitivity for faster mapping speed. Therefore,
it was not surprising that Bowtie had the lowest mapping percentage of all tested programs.
In addition, using genomic sequences as the reference for mapping RNA-seq reads with
Bowtie might not be appropriate since reads spanning two exons cannot be mapped without
the support of gap alignment.

An alternative to Bowtie is BWA (Li and Durbin, 2009), which also uses a full-text minutespace index based algorithm but supports gapped alignments. In our test, BWA used least
amount of RAM and was comparable to Bowtie in computing time. The gapped alignment
feature of BWA makes it more suitable should variations (i.e., small insertion/deletion or
InDels) exist between the reference genome or transcriptome and the RNA-seq reads being
mapped. This serves to increase the mapping sensitivity of alignments. In our test, BWA
reported more reads properly mapped than Bowtie, suggesting BWA is more sensitive in
identifying possible alignments between short reads and reference sequences.
Two other programs tested were Novoalign and SHRiMP. They were both noticeably slower
than Bowtie or BWA programs. Both Novoalign and SHRiMP programs use a hashing
reference based algorithm, which can be traced back to BLAST searching but is optimized
for alignment of short reads. For Novoalign, we tested the free version and thus only one
thread was used while in all other cases four threads were used during the read mapping
trials. Therefore it is likely the licensed version of Novoalign, employing fully multi-thread
functions, will exhibit greatly reduced computation time. Novoalign showed the highest
mapping percentage in all tested program, indicating the excellent sensitivity of the hashing
reference based algorithm. Unlike Novoalign, SHRiMP employs a k-mer hashing index and
Smith-Waterman algorithm which gives it robust mapping sensitivity and specificity (David

16

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

et al., 2011). However, SHRiMP requires large amounts of RAM and was the slowest
program tested. The increased computational time and RAM requirements make SHRiMP
less attractive for projects needing high-throughput data analyses.
The final program we tested is Tophat (Trapnell et al., 2009). Tophat is a splice junction
mapping program quite different from the previous four programs. Tophat is designed to
align RNA-seq reads to a reference genome. Using Tophat, RNA-seq reads can be analyzed
to identify novel splice variants of genes. Tophat first employs iterative rounds of Bowtie
mapping to identify genomic regions with RNA-seq read mapping, and then to generate
potential splice donor/acceptor sites flanking the sequence. Unmatched reads are then
mapped to these splice junction sequences again by Bowtie to confirm possible splice
junctions. Tophat prefers a genome sequence as a reference and mapping results may not be
reliable if only a transcriptome reference is used. Of all five programs tested, Tophat
required the most RAM for alignment processing. Thus, Tophat may be best used in a highperformance computing environment.
Overall, the choice of which alignment program to use should be based on both the
available computer resources and experimental design. If the alignment process is to be
performed on a standard desktop computer (e.g., about 4G RAM), SHRiMP and Tophat
should be avoided due to memory constraints. However, Bowtie, BWA, and Novoalign can
map reads efficiently on standard office computers. On the other hand, if a genome
sequence is available for a reference, or the purpose of study is to identify InDel’s between a
reference and reads, Bowtie may not be the best choice since it lacks gap alignment
capabilities. Tophat is preferred when a genome sequence is present because it fully
considers potential donor/acceptor sites in the genome and allows the alignment to cross
splice junctions accurately, compared to the other programs. However, should a
transcriptome be used as mapping reference, Tophat should be avoided as it is designed for
use with genome sequence data. Finally, although all programs tested herein fully support
both Illumina and SOLiD single or paired ends reads, SHRiMP and BWA (through its BWASW module) also support mapping of mixed RNA-seq short reads with longer Sanger or 454
Roche based reads. In such situations, where mixed reads are to be used, employing a single
program saves both time and effort in the subsequent analyses.
Overall, with the continuous increase in throughput for recently developed sequencing
technologies, new algorithms are becoming available almost monthly; while older programs
are continually refined to reduce computational time and memory demands. However, there
is not a perfect program suited for all experimental designs and hardware requirements. The
choice of programs will need to be reviewed and evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
2.5 Quantification of gene expression level
Currently most short read alignment programs adopt SAM (or its binary version, BAM) as
the alignment output format. SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map format) is a tab-delimited
text format designed for recording short read alignment information. Although it is human
readable, a typical SAM file will consist of millions of lines of mapping information that is
required for downstream analyses. In the next steps of data processing, most RNA-Seq
projects aim to utilize read mapping as a means to quantify gene expression levels across
entire reference transcriptomes or genomes (Fig 5).
An early approach of using RNA-seq to quantify gene expression relied on simply counting
the total number of reads mapping to each transcript in sample. However, since the total
number of reads varied between each sample, read counts could not be use for direct

Gene Expression Analysis Using
RNA-Seq from Organisms Lacking Substantial Genomic Resources

17

comparison or determination of differential expression between samples. In addition to total
read count numbers between samples, the length of transcripts within each sample may
vary and longer transcripts are generally more likely to have more reads mapped to them
than shorter ones. Thus, performing tasks such as finding the highest expressed genes in a
sample via direct read counting proved to be inaccurate. In an effort to normalize the
sample size and transcript lengths for head-to-head read count comparisons, Mortazavi and
coworkers (2008) developed the term Reads Per Kilobase per Million of mapped reads
(RPKM) as a standard to compare different genes within or across different samples
(Mortazavi et al., 2008). RPKM and its derived term FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase per
Million of mapped reads) for paired end reads, have been widely adopted in RNAseq
studies employing various experimental systems.
Since RPKM is easy to calculate and understand, it provides a platform to facilitate
comparison of transcript levels both within and between samples. However, since the
purpose of most studies involving RPKM is to compare differential gene expression, one
must be aware that RPKM values may be affected by both experimental and computational
issues. Experimental issues such as the quality of RNA, contamination of ribosomal RNA
and length of output reads (Pepke et al., 2009; Costa et al., 2010) and computational
influences including accuracy of gene modeling, and inclusion/exclusion of multiple
mapped reads, may all affect the results obtained. One issue deserving special attention is
the diminished statistical power one accepts when using RPKM to detect differential
expression of longer transcripts (Oshlack and Wakefield, 2009). Employing RPKM, where
the number of reads from a given transcript is divided by the length of the transcript, serves
to deflate statistical power by producing a large sample size (more reads). To illustrate this,
assume a 1000 bp gene (gene A) has 5 and 10 mapped reads in sample 1 and sample 2,
respectively. In the same samples, a 10,000 bp gene (gene B) has 50 and 100 mapped reads,
respectively. By definition of RPKM, since gene B is 10 times longer and has 10 times more
reads mapped, both genes have identical RPKM values and fold changes in the two
samples. Thus one would assume the confidence of gene A and gene B being differentially
expressed is exactly same. However, since gene A has a much smaller sample size (15 reads
in total) compared with gene B (150 reads), gene A is more prone to statistical error when
trying to identify a 2 fold-change in expression between samples 1 and 2. Therefore,
although RPKM is widely used to provide a scalable value to quantify gene expression
levels, it is affected by variation in a transcript length dependent manner and should not be
used to directly compare gene expression.
2.6 Comparison of differential expression
One common goal of many large-scale transcriptome studies is to identify differentially
expressed genes between two or more samples. While microarrays have been widely used
for over a decade to assess transcriptome-wide gene expression levels, RNA-seq
technologies have displayed several advantages over microarrays, such as the ability to
identify novel transcripts and to assess quantitative allele-specific gene expression.
However, it is still debatable which tool is better to accurately assess gene expression values.
In a recent study (Bloom et al., 2009), microarray and RNA-seq results were compared using
quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assays and it was determined that both methods performed
similarly in measuring differential gene expression. The microarray had an advantage over
RNAseq in better measure of low-abundance transcripts (Bloom et al., 2009); however, when
results of microarray and RNA-seq were further assessed with 2D LC-MS/MS the

18

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

expression values estimated by RNA-Seq appeared to be better correlated with the
proteomics data (Fu et al., 2009). Overall, these studies prove that RNA-Seq may serve as a
reliable method to accurately estimate absolute transcript levels.
Since both microarray and RNA-seq are used to quantify expression levels of transcripts,
statistical methods developed for microarrays have been adopted to compare gene
expression using RNA-seq. However, there are notable differences between the two
technologies and methods successfully used for microarray analysis might not be
appropriate for RNA-seq data (Costa et al., 2010). First, the gold standard for any microarray
studies is to have at least three replicates in each condition while many RNA-seq projects
lack the luxury of replicates due to the relatively expensive cost of sequencing RNA-seq
libraries. Methods that have been used in microarray analysis range from simple t-testing to
more complicated statistical modeling; but all these techniques rely on having multiple
replicates to identify differentially expressed genes. The absence of multiple replicates
greatly reduces the statistical power of RNAseq methods. Secondly, for microarray analysis,
fluorescence intensity is utilized as the measurement of transcript levels and these data may
be treated as continuous data. However, RNA-seq studies utilizing read counts (or RPKM)
to gauge the expression of a particular transcript generate discrete data. Thus, statistical
models developed for continuous data might not be effective when applied to data
generated from an RNA-seq experiment.
Many studies have utilized different statistical tools to identify differentially expressed
transcripts in RNA-seq experiments. Simple approaches such as classical Z-test and
Fishers exact test have been employed for this purpose (Bloom et al., 2009; Hashimoto et
al., 2009). Although these methods are appropriate for hypothesis testing of discrete data,
they do not consider the global variations of all genes, thus less robust than more
advanced approaches discussed below. There are several studies reported where more
sophisticated microarray based methods have been modified and made suitable for RNAseq projects. One of the pioneering reports involved RNAs extracted from liver and
kidney of the same individual that were separated into seven aliquots for each sample
and sequenced in individual lanes of a Illumina genome analyzer (Marioni et al., 2008).
The variations of these technological replicates were then calculated and were found to fit
the variance predicted by a Poisson model. Using the Poisson model allowed the authors
to identify 30% more differentially expressed genes than a standard statistic analysis and
employing microarrays with the same samples (Marioni et al., 2008). Based on the notion
that a Poisson distribution can predict the variations in RNA-seq data, DEGseq, a
Bioconductor software package, has been developed for examining differential expression
of RNA-seq read count data (Wang et al., 2010). DEGseq modeled the number of reads
derived from a gene into a Poisson distribution and used the Fisher’s exact test and
likelihood ratio test to identify differentially expressed genes (Wang et al., 2010).
However, it has been argued the Poisson distribution will underestimate actual variations
in replicated samples and tends to predict smaller variations than are actually present in
the data (Nagalakshmi et al., 2008). As a result, methods based on the Poisson distribution
do not control false discoveries very well. In addition to Poisson distributions, two other
Bioconductor packages, DESeq and EdgeR, both take read counts as input and use
negative binomial distributions to estimate variations of RNA-seq data (Anders and
Huber, 2010; Robinson et al., 2010). EdgeR employs negative binomial distributions to
account for variability and assesses differential expression based on Empirical Bayes
methods (Robinson et al., 2010). The DESeq package models distributions of read count

Gene Expression Analysis Using
RNA-Seq from Organisms Lacking Substantial Genomic Resources

19

data by negative binomial distribution, with variance and mean linked by local regression
(Anders and Huber, 2010). Compared with previous Poisson based program, both DESeq
and EdgeR control the probability of false discoveries and produce good fits when the
number of replicates is small (Anders and Huber, 2010).
In addition to the Bioconductor packages discussed above, another standalone tool
termed “Cufflinks”, written by same research group that developed Bowtie and Tophat,
may be used to read SAM files produced from Tophat directly and compare differential
expression in pair-wise manner (Trapnell et al., 2010). The program extracts read count
information from SAM files and computes the entropy of the average distribution minus
the average of the individual entropies [Jensen-Shannon divergence; see (Menendez et al.,
1997)] and the difference between abundances of transcripts in two conditions may be
calculated as the square root of this divergence. Cufflinks can be easily integrated with
Bowtie/Tophat workflow and outputs FPKM values for two samples and the significance
level of the statistics tests. In addition to transcript expression, Cufflinks may also be used
to find significant changes in transcript splicing and promoter usage between two
samples.
2.7 SNP identification and allele specific gene expression
One major advantage of RNA-seq technology over microarray based approaches is that one
may quantify not only total gene expression, but also allele specific gene expression (ASGE)
at same time. To study allele specific gene expression using microarrays, one must have
very detailed characterization of genome polymorphisms and then specifically design
probes to assess the abundance of each allele independently on the array. Therefore, it is
difficult to study ASGE in less well-characterized species or genetic models that possess
little information of known polymorphisms. With rapid progress in next generation
sequencing technologies (NGS), RNA-Seq has been shown to provide single-base resolution
and quantitative information for thousands of genes simultaneously (Pastinen, 2010).
Notably, this approach does not rely on previous knowledge of known variations and can
be used for both identifying polymorphisms and quantifying ASGE. Using both 454 and
Illumina sequencing platforms respectively, allelic expression imbalances have been
assessed in Drosophila hybrids, Xiphophorus fishes, and in humans (Serre et al., 2008;
Daelemans et al., 2010; Fontanillas et al., 2010; Shen et al., 2011).
Here we demonstrate our recent ASGE study using Xiphophorus interspecies hybrid fishes.
The genus Xiphophorus has at least 27 species of live-bearing fishes found from northern
Mexico south into Belize and Guatemala (Kallman and Kazianis, 2006). The Xiphophorus
genus couples extreme genetic variability among Xiphophorus species with the capability of
producing fertile interspecies hybrids that have allowed chromosomal inheritance of
complex traits to be followed into individual F1 and backcross hybrid progeny (Kazianis et
al., 2001; Walter and Kazianis, 2001; Meierjohann and Schartl, 2006). Using interspecies
hybrids provides a unique opportunity to reveal underlying mechanisms of genetic
variation.
We have assembled the transcriptome of X. maculatus Jp163 A, a highly inbred line species
of Xiphophorus (Fig 6) using RNA-seq sequencing from brain, heart, and liver tissues (see
section 2.5). We first investigate transcriptome-wide SNP polymorphisms between two
highly inbred Xiphophorus species: X. maculatus Jp 163 B and X. couchianus. To do this RNAseq reads sequenced from X. maculatus Jp163 B were mapped to the reference transcriptome
of X. maculatus Jp163 A by Bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009) and SNPs were called by

20

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

Samtools (Li et al., 2009). The density of intraspecific SNPs was about 1 SNP/49 kb of
transcriptome [Figure 7; (Shen et al., 2011)].

Fig. 6. Fishes used in this study. X. maculatus Jp 163 A carrying the Sd pigment pattern is the
species utilized for deep transcriptome development and eventual assembly of the reference
transcriptome. F1 interspecies hybrids utilized in these studies were produced by crossing
the X. maculatus Jp 163 B (Sp pigment pattern) and X. couchianus parental species. RNA-seq
reads analyzed in this study were sequenced from X. maculatus Jp 163 B, X. couchianus and
their F1 interspecies hybrids respectively.
We wished to ascertain ASGE between X. maculatus Jp 163 B, X. couchianus and an F1 hybrid
produced from crossing these two species (Fig 6). Thus, we first determined that the 90,788
SNPs, identified between the X. maculatus reference transcriptome and X. couchianus were
also polymorphic between the X. maculatus Jp 163 B strain and X. couchianus. To improve the
accuracy of ASGE analysis in the hybrid, we scored only genes that exhibited greater than 20
SNP supporting reads. These constraints resulted in 38,746 SNPs between X. maculatus Jp
163 B and X. couchianus that could be clearly assigned to one or the other parental alleles and
were unambiguously mapped to 6,524 Xiphophorus transcripts in the reference
transcriptome.
After identification of SNPs, ASGE can be calculated as number of reads mapped to each
allele in the F1 hybrid (for a diagrammatic illustration of the process, see Fig 7). Since most
short alignment programs only allow a limited number of base mismatches (i.e., 2 in case
of Bowtie) between reads and reference sequences, the reads representing the X.
couchianus alleles possessed natural disadvantages in mapping efficiency since they
carried an extra mismatch (i.e., the SNP) compared with X. maculatus reads. In the F1
hybrid, we found many transcripts showed more X. maculatus mapped reads than X.
couchianus ones when the mapping was back to the X. maculatus reference transcriptome.
To eliminate this read mapping bias and create an environment where reads from both X.

Gene Expression Analysis Using

21

maculatus and X. couchianus alleles had equal chances of mapping to the transcriptome, we
first duplicated the X. maculatus reference and then introduced all X. couchianus specific
SNP’s into it to produce an in silico X. couchianus reference transcriptome (based on X.
maculatus transcriptome with masked SNPs). The induction of X. couchianus reference
transcriptome allowed reads with X. couchianus alleles to have comparable likelihood of
being mapped in ASGE study.

Fig. 7. A diagrammatic example of identification of SNPs and measurement of ASGE in F1
interspecies hybrids. Red bars represent RNA-Seq reads mapped to the reference
transcriptome. Most reads from X. maculatus Jp 163 B match perfectly to the Jp 163 A
reference transcriptome. RNA-seq reads from X. couchianus were also mapped to X.
maculatus Jp 163 A reference transcriptome and SNPs sites were identified by comparing
consensus bases of RNA-seq reads (C in this case) to the corresponding base in the
reference transcriptome (A in this case). In the hybrid, reads mapped to SNPs sites are
classified by the bases they carry and counted separately as the measurement of ASGE. In
this SNP, 4 X. maculatus allele reads and 3 X. couchianus allele reads were counted in the
hybrid.
As shown in Fig 8, using the corrected reference transcriptome allowed both X. maculatus
and X. couchianus alleles to exhibit a more balanced expression pattern (Fig 8b) in the hybrid
genetic background than without normalization (Fig 8a). Without proper normalization, we
found over 84% of genes in the transcriptome were biased toward over-representation of the
X. maculatus allele (fraction > 0.5, Fig 8a). After production of the in silico reference
transcriptome and tolerating 5 mismatches, analyses of the distribution of ASGE in F1
hybrids indicate that most genes (5,980 of 6,524 genes or 92%) exhibit relatively balanced
allele expression in the hybrid genetic background (<70% of preference of one particular
allele, those between 0.3 and 0.7 in Fig 8b). Overall, employment of high throughput
sequencing technology and proper normalization approaches allow direct and accurate
assessment of ASGE in the interspecies hybrids.

3. Conclusion
The bottleneck of large-scale NGS projects has shifted from obtaining experimental data to
downstream bioinformatic analyses. With the continuous development of software
infrastructure to suit the needs of RNA-Seq analyses, there are several competent programs
in each of the analysis step; such as transcriptome assembly, read mapping, and
identification of differential gene expression. The real challenge facing many biologists is to
find the right tool to use and carefully weighing the strength and weakness of each tool. The

Gene Expression Analysis Using

23

constant advance in sequencing technology will continue to increase the amount of data
produced, urging the use of the most efficient tool within the capacity of available computer
resources. The combination of the carefully designed experiment and right methodology
utilizing NGS data will open a new era for studying species with little historical background
genetic information available.

1. Introduction
Sequencing of bacterial genomes has become a common technique of the present day
microbiology. Thereafter, data mining in complete genome sequence is an essential step to
uncover the uniqueness and evolutionary success of microorganisms. Oligonucleotide usage
(OU or k-mer) statistics provides invaluable tools to get insight into genome organization
and functionality.
The study of genome OU signatures has a long history dating back to early publications by
Karlin et al. 1995, 1997, 1998, who focused mainly on dinucleotide compositional biases and
their evolutionary implications. Statistical approaches of OU comparison were further
advanced by Deschavanne et al., 1999, who applied chaos game algorithms; and by Pride et
al., 2003, who extended the analysis to tetranucleotides using Markov Chain Model
simulations. Later, a number of practical tools for phylogenetic comparison of bacterial
genomes (Coenye & Vandamme, 2004; van Passel et al., 2006); identification of horizontally
transferred genomic islands (Mrázek & Karlin, 1999; Pried & Blaser, 2002; Nakamura et al.,
2004; Azad & Lawrence, 2005; Dufraign et al., 2005; Becq et al., 2007) and assignment of
unknown genomic sequences (Abe et al., 2003; Teeling et al., 2004) based on OU statistics
became publicly available. These approaches exploited the notion that genomic OU
composition was less variable within genomes rather than between them, regardless of
which genomic regions had been taken into consideration (Jernigan & Baran, 2002). A
general belief was that if a significant compositional difference was discovered in genomic
fragments relative to the core genome, these loci most likely can be assigned to horizontally
transferred genetic elements (transposons, prophages or integrated plasmids). This
approach was criticized by several researchers (Koski et al., 2001; Wang 2001), who pointed
out that codon bias and base composition are poor indicators of horizontal gene transfer.
Therefore, there is a need for more informative parameters which also take into account
higher order DNA variation. An overview of the current OU statistical methods based on
di-, tetra- and hexanucleotides has been published recently (Bohlin et al., 2008). The
conclusion of the review was that all methods were context dependent and, though being
efficient and powerful, none of them were superior in all applications. Thus, the major

28

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

motivation of our work was to develop more flexible and informative algorithms seamlessly
integrating di- to heptanucleotides OU analysis for reliable identification of divergent
genomic regions.

2. Linguistic approaches for genomics and metagenomics
Genome linguistics is respectively known as the analysis of frequencies of k-mers in genome
wide DNA sequences. The basic hypothesis is that biased distribution of oligonucleotides in
bacterial genome is genome specific and may serve as a signature. Each OU pattern may be
characterized by a number of OU statistical parameters, namely: local pattern deviation (D),
pattern skew (PS), relative variance (RV) and several others that will be explained below.
The requirements for the OU statistics are as follows: i) distances between patterns of
different word length (from di- through to heptanucleotides) calculated for the same
sequence must be comparable; i.e. one may use longer word patterns to perform a large
scale analysis and then switch to shorter word patterns for a more detailed view; ii) OU
patterns calculated for sequences of different lengths must be comparable provided that the
length of the sequence is longer than the specified thresholds; iii) alterations of OU patterns
may be analyzed by different non-redundant parameters (D, PS and RV with different
schemes of normalization by frequencies of shorter constituent words). Superimposition of
these OU characteristics allows better discrimination of divergent genomic regions.
2.1 Oligonucleotide usage pattern concept
OU pattern was denoted as a matrix of deviations [1…N] of observed from expected counts
for all possible words of length N. Oligonucleotides or words are distributed in sequences
logarithmically and deviations of their frequencies from expectations may be found as follows:

 w    1... N

where n is any nucleotide A, T, G or C in the N-long word; C[1…N]|obs is the observed count
of a word [1…N]; C[1…N]|e is its expected count and C[1…N]|0 is a standard count
estimated from the assumption of an equal distribution of words in the sequence:
(C[1…N]|0 = Lseq  4-N).
Expected counts of words C[1…N]|e were calculated in accordance to the applied
normalization scheme. For instance, C[1…N]|e = C[1…N]|0 if OU is not normalized, and
C[1…N]|e = C[1…N]|n if OU is normalized by empirical frequencies of shorter constituent
words of length n. The expected count of a word C[1…N]|e of the length N in a Lseq long
sequence normalized by frequencies of n-mers (n < N) is calculated as follows:

C[1 ...l

29

Where the F[1…n] values are the observed frequencies of a particular word of length n in the
sequence and  is any nucleotide A, T, G or C. For instance, the expected count of a word
ATGC in a sequence of Lseq nucleotides normalized by frequencies of trinucleotides would
be determined as follows:
C ATGC  Lseq  FATG 

FTGC
FTGA  FTGT  FTGG  FTGC

(3)

Two approaches of normalization have been exploited where the F values are calculated for
the complete genome (generalized normalization) or for a given sliding window (local
normalization).
The distance D between two patterns was calculated as the sum of absolute distances
between ranks of identical words (w, in a total 4N different words) after ordering of words
by [1…N] values (equation 1) in patterns i and j as follows:
4N

D(%)  100 

 rank
w

w ,i

 rankw , j  Dmin

Dmax  Dmin

(4)

Application of ranks instead of relative oligonucleotide frequency statistics made the
comparison of OU patterns less biased to the sequence length provided that the sequences
are longer than the limits of 0.3, 1.2, 5, 18.5, 74 and 295 kbp for di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, hexaand heptanucleotides, respectively (Reva and Tümmler, 2004).
PS is a particular case of D where patterns i and j are calculated for the same DNA but for
direct and reversed strands, respectively. Dmax = 4N  (4N – 1)/2 and Dmin = 0 when calculating
a D, or, in a case of PS calculation, Dmin = 4N if N is an odd number, or Dmin = 4N – 2N if N is
an even number due to the presence of palindromic words. Normalization of D-values by
Dmax ensures that the distances between two sequences are comparable regardless of the
word length.
Relative variance of an OU pattern was calculated by the following equation:
4N

RV 



4

where N is word length; Δ2w is the square of a word w count deviation (see equation 1); and
σ0 is the expected standard deviation of the word distribution in a randomly generated
sequence which depends on the sequence length (Lseq) and the word length (N):

 0  0.02 

2.2 Compositional polymorphism of bacterial genomes
Biased distribution of k-mers may be explained by selective forces of DNA reparation
enzymes of microorganisms, which may sense stereochemical properties of DNA
fragments. A strong correlation was discovered between frequencies of oligonucleotides

30

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

and their physicochemical properties such as base stacking energy, propeller twist angle,
bendability, protein deformability and position preference in the DNA helical repeats
(Fig. 1) calculated by the additive scale approach proposed by Baldi & Baisnée, 2000. It
looks plausible that proteins of the replication-reparation system may sense the
stereochemical properties of the DNA molecule and allow higher mutation rates in
atypical regions; however, it has not yet been proved experimentally. The latter may
explain the pervasive properties of genomic signatures that are reported for bacterial
genomes (Jernigan & Baran, 2002). Despite a significant conservation of the OU pattern in
genomic core DNA sequences, every bacterial genome contains loci of DNA which differ
significantly from the core sequence. These loci usually contain gene clusters for
ribosomal RNA and ribosomal proteins, horizontally transferred genomic islands, DNA
fragments with multiple repeats and some other features. Superimposition of different
OU parameters allows discrimination of divergent genomic regions. Briefly: rRNA
operons are characterized by extremely high PS and low RV; giant genes with multiple
repeated elements have high or moderate PS and high RV; horizontally transferred
genetic elements are characterized by increased divergence between RV and GRV
accompanied by high D; and genes for ribosomal proteins show a moderate increase of D,
PS and RV above genomic averages. In the examples given above D denotes the distance
between a local pattern calculated for a sliding window and the global pattern determined
for the complete genome; PS is local pattern skew; and RV and GRV are variances of local
OU patterns normalized by GC-content of the sliding window and the complete genome,
respectively.
A Web-based applet SeqWord Genome Browser (SWGB) was developed and available online at www.bi.up.ac.za/SeqWord/ to visualize DNA compositional variations in precalculated bacterial and viral genomes. The SWGB is basically comprised of two views,
denoted by the ‘Gene Map’ and ‘Diagram’ tabs. The ‘Gene Map’ tab offers a simple view of
an entire genome at a glance and gives users access to a number of important pre-calculated
OU statistics superimposed on the gene map (Fig. 2). The ‘Diagram’ tab allows flexible
filtering of the underlying data based on the criteria chosen by users. Although the
underlying data is pre-calculated, the user may, by simply changing selected parameters,
generate many alternative plots, which give different insights into the natural genomic
variation. On the dot-plot diagram, each genomic fragment selected by the sliding window
is represented by a dot with X and Y coordinates, which correspond to values of OU
parameters chosen from X and Y drop-down lists, respectively. The Z axis parameter may
be set as well. In this case, the dots are coloured by values of OU parameters selected for the
Z axis, and the colour range is displayed on the vertical colour bar on the left of the plot area
(Fig. 3).
Several routines have been developed to identify horizontally transferred genomic islands,
genes for ribosomal RNA and proteins, non-functional pseudogenes and genes of other
functional categories. All these routines are described in detail with illustrations in
supplementary web-pages (use the ‘Help’ link in the applet window). Take for example the
genome of Pseudomonas putida KT2440, a known mosaic genome with 105 genomic islands
above 4000 bp in length (Weinel et al., 2002). Many of these features can be visualized at a
glance using the SWGB without any in depth analysis (see Fig. 2). On the ‘Diagram’ view
the parameters n1_4mer:RV, n1_4mer:GRV and n0_4mer:D were selected for the X, Y and Z
axes, respectively, as we showed previously (see Fig. 3).

Comparison of Prokaryotic Genomes and Environmental Sequences

Plotting local relative OU variance (RV) against global relative variance (GRV) basically
shows the effect of normalization by global mononucleotide content. The core genome is
then represented on the dot plot as the positive linear correlation line where RV  GRV
(Fig. 3). In other words, these fragments exhibit such compositional closeness to the core
genome that normalizing by local mononucleotide content does not have any effect
compared to normalizing by the global content. These genomic fragments also exhibit
compositional similarity to the genomic average; and are therefore coloured blue. Scattered
dots lying peripheral to the expected strong linear correlation do not belong to the core
genome and also have a higher distance from the genomic average and are hence coloured
green and red.

Fig. 1. Tetranucleotide usage patterns calculated for genomes of four different organisms.
The deviations Δw of observed from expected counts are shown for all 256 tetranucleotide
permutations (16×16 cells) by a colour code (right bar) depicting overrepresented
(red) and rare (blue) words. The words are grouped into 39 equivalence classes and
ordered by decreasing base stacking energy row-by-row starting from the upper corner
(class 39).

regions. In this example a part of the chromosome of Pseudomonas putida KT2440
(127-774 kbp) is displayed in the applet window. A genomic fragment was highlighted
using the function ‘Select region’ and a giant gene, PP0168, was selected by ‘Select gene’.
A pop-up window ‘Gene Details’ was opened by double-clicking the gene on the map.
Genes are indicated by red and grey (for hypothetical) bars. The black horizontal line
separates genes by their direction of translation.
Changing of the set of parameters as shown on Fig. 4 allows separation of core
housekeeping genes from clusters of genes encoding ribosomal proteins and ribosomal
RNA, vestigial regions with pseudogenes and giant genes with multiple repeats.
SWGB is linked to a database of pre-calculated OU patterns of bacterial genomes (2243
complete sequences, including bacterial chromosomes, plasmids and some viruses were
available at the time of writing of this chapter and new sequences are regularly being
added). The SWGB allows tentative annotation of the various divergent regions and
provides overviews for use in comparative genomics. Users may download the command
line version of the OligoWords program to analyze locally their own sequences. A packaged
version of the SWGB allows users to view and manipulate their OligoWords results locally
using a compatible web-browser.

all selected regions. In this example the genomic regions of Salmonella typhimurium LT2
(NC_003197) which correspond to horizontally transferred genetic elements were
selected.

2.3 Signature words and identification of environmental sequences
In genomic and metagenomic literature the occurrences of 2 to 7 bp oligonucleotides have
been studied extensively. Patterns of short oligomers (words) have been used successfully
for DNA read clustering (Chatterji et al., 2008; Kislyuk et al., 2009; Saeed & Halgamuge,
2009). However, short oligonucleotide patterns usually do not provide enough information
for binning DNA reads to bacterial species or higher taxonomic units. Longer words of 8 to
14 nucleotides generally are more specific. Nevertheless, it was illustrated that the approach
based on the analysis of frequencies of all the permutations of oligonucleotides of a given
length such as discussed above is not effective for analysis of 8 to 14 letter words (Bohlin et
al., 2008). Furthermore, an analysis of all possible permutations of 8 to 14 bp words would
be computationally expensive because the total number of possible permutations of words is
4L where L is the word length. For words of length 8 to 14 bp, this quantity becomes very
large. Additionally, the random changes in the frequencies of such a large number of words
obscure the genome specific information present in a few signature words. According to
Kirzhner et al., 2005, less than 1% of 10-mers are informative in a large-scale comparison of
bacterial genomes.
A first investigation into exploiting the information present in 8 to 14 letter words in 13
strains from the genus Pseudomonas was made by Davenport et al., 2009. It has been shown
as well that certain profiles of signature words may help to distinguish DNA fragments that
originated from different genomes (Saeed & Halgamuge, 2009).

Linguistic Approaches for Annotation, Visualization and
Comparison of Prokaryotic Genomes and Environmental Sequences

35

In this work an attempt was made to standardize the linguistic approaches of binning
metagenomic DNA reads by creating a database of signature words of Eubacteria and
Archaebacteria represented in GenBank. The first step was to develop methods for
summarizing the large amounts of data associated with these words. To avoid using the
words that do not provide any taxonomic information, the most divergent words were
selected and stored in the database. Currently, the frequencies of 172,636 signature words
calculated in 768 bacterial chromosomes are stored in a binary database file available for
download from the SeqWord project Web-site at www.bi.up.ac.za/SeqWord/oligodb/.
Furthermore, scoring functions were designed, which measure the likelihood that a given
DNA fragment originated from a given taxonomic group.
This tool also may be used to identify the origin of DNA sequences or whole clusters of
DNA sequences. There are a number of programs such as LikelyBin (Kislyuk et al., 2009),
CompostBin (Chatterji et al., 2008) and some others that cluster DNA sequences, but there is
no default methodology for inferring the taxonomic affinity of these clusters. Typically,
BLAST is used to compare these clusters to the databases of DNA sequences. Frequently
these clusters consist of several short sequences that cannot be easily assembled, which
makes using BLAST complicated. TETRA identifies long unknown DNA sequences by
comparison of the whole patterns of frequencies of tetranucleotides (Teeling et al., 2004). A
tool based on occurrences of 8 to 14 letter words is expected to work equally well both on
clusters of sequences and single long sequences.
2.3.1 Statistical background of selection of signature words
To identify prospective signature words, the distribution score coefficients were calculated
for each 8 to 14-mer permutation as follows:

DS 

100000

2  2

(7)

where µ indicates the average length of spans (in base pairs) between the repeated words in
the sequence (i.e., µ = sequence_length/number_of_words); and σ is the standard deviation
of the span lengths. The DS for a word increases in value when there is a high frequency of
occurrence (µ is minimal) and the words are evenly distributed (σ tends to 0). The DS
coefficient assigns low scores to infrequent words and to local repeats while giving higher
scores to words occurring frequently and evenly distributed throughout the genome. The
words that have DS above the threshold value of 0.3 in at least one genome were included in
the template of signature words. Furthermore, their frequencies were recalculated for all
genomes. The threshold value was empirically determined to ensure that the template
contained similar numbers of words for each different word length and that an appropriate
ratio between template size and word specificity is obtained. The final template contains
172,636 signature words; that is approximately 0.1% of the total number of all possible
permutations of 8 bp to 14 bp oligonucleotides. Note that in this work each oligonucleotide
and its reverse complement were considered as the same word so that the two different
strands of the DNA molecule will be assigned identical scores.
To improve maintenance and operational flexibility of the database, the numeric frequencies
of words may be replaced by percentile values without any significant loss of information.
The empirical cumulative distribution of the frequency of occurrence of the words in the
template was studied and the following non-linear regression model was fitted to the data:

36

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

f 

exp3 p  9
L4.5

(8)

where f is the frequency of a word per 100 Kbp, L is the word length and p is the probability
that the word occurs at a frequency less than or equal to f. For example, according to
equation 8 for 50% of words of the length 8 bp (p = 0.5; L = 8) the frequency f is in the range
from 0 to 3.13 words per 100 Kbp of the given sequence; and 90% (p = 0.9) of 8-mers have
frequencies from 0 to 10.41. Four categories were designated for rare (p < 0.1), common (0.1
≤ p <0.5), frequent (0.5 ≤ p < 0.9) and abundant (0.9 ≤ p) words. The borders of the percentile
categories calculated by equation 8 are shown in Table 1.
The performance of a signature word to separate DNA reads of different origins or to bin a
cluster of reads to a taxonomic unit depends on the set of taxonomic units to be
differentiated and the task formulation. Several scoring algorithms were used in this study.
All the scores were normalized to a range from 0 to 10. The scores were used to order the
words in the database and to select the ones with the highest scores.
Word divergence is scored by the variance of percentile values (see Table 1) in the selected
genomes normalized by the maximum possible variance. The most diverse word would be
rare in one half of the selected genomes and abundant in the other half of the genomes.
To select the words, which are rare or abundant in all selected genomes, the following score
was used:
Score = 10 × (Av – 0.05)/0.9

(9)

where Av is the average of the percentile values calculated for a word in selected genomes.
To select rare words (10 – Score) was used.
The perfect word to distinguish between taxa is one that is similarly distributed in genomes
belonging to the same taxon but is differently distributed in different taxa. The scores were
assigned in the spirit of ANOVA by computing the ratio of the sums of square deviations
over the average values between taxa and within every taxon.
Another practical task may consist in distinguishing one taxon (outgroup) from a number of
other taxa (counterparts) by diverse, abundant or rare words. In our study this approach
was termed as confronted comparison. Three scoring algorithms were used:
DiversityScore  Av0  Av g

1  Var0 n

(10)

AbundanceScore  10  Av0  Av g  2 1  Var0 n

(11)

ScarceScore  10  Av g  Av0  2 1  Var0 n

(12)

where Av0 and Avg are average frequencies of the word in genomes of the outgroup and
counterpart taxonomic units, correspondingly; Var0 is the variance of the word
frequencies in the outgroup genomes and n is the number of genomes in the outgroup
taxonomic unit.
Computer simulation of metagenomic datasets was done by the MetaSim program (Richter
et al., 2008). DNA reads were clustered by the LikelyBin algorithm (Kislyuk et al., 2009). The
database of signature words and the OligoDBViewer program are available for download
from www.bi.up.ac.za/SeqWord/oligodb/.

2.3.2 OligoDBViewer and the database of signature words
The main window of OligoDBViewer is shown in Fig. 5. The functionality of the
OligoDBViewer is described in detail on the project Web site. The program allows selecting
genomes or taxonomic units from the list and searching for the best discriminative words by
using the program functions accessible through the toolbar and the ‘Command’ menu. The
resulting list of ordered words will be shown in the pop-up panel on the right hand side as
in Fig. 6. In this example the diverse words were searched with the goal of separating the
genomes of Mycobacterium avium k10 [NC_002944] and M. tuberculosis F11 [NC_009565]. The
divergence scores are shown in column ‘C’. The number of times an oligomer falls into the
categories of rare, common, frequent or abundant words is shown respectively from left to
right in column ‘Stat’.
The list of the words returned by OligoDBViewer may be highly redundant. For example,
words that only differ by a single nucleotide may be expected to have similar distributions
in genomes. To reduce the redundancy of the selected words, several filter options may be
set. The filter settings in Fig. 6 removes all the words that differ from the words with the
highest scores by less than 30 % similarity (another option is available to set the minimal
number of mismatches) as well as the words that are left or right shifted sub-words or
shorter constituents of longer words that have higher scores. Then the list is cut off so that
only the top 10 words remain. Additionally, the list of selected words may be filtered by the
word length and the score threshold. All word filtering settings is reversible.

2.3.3 Algorithms of binning of clusters of DNA reads to taxonomic units
To estimate the similarity of a cluster of DNA reads to bacterial taxonomic units the
percentile values were used (Table 1). All DNA reads of the cluster were concatenated in an
artificial sequence and the frequency of the words normalized per 100 Kbp were counted (fvalue). Then the f-values were converted to percentiles:

p

ln  f   4.5 ln L   9
3

(13)

Note that equation 13 is the inverse of the equation 8. The meanings of the coefficients were
explained above.

Comparison of Prokaryotic Genomes and Environmental Sequences

39

Fig. 6. The top 10 most diverse words which separate M. tuberculosis from M. avium. The
filter was set to reduce the redundancy of the selected words.
Next, the distance values D between an unknown sequence and the taxonomic units were
calculated as follows:
2

D  10 



 pi ' pi     1 
 mi  pi 

2

pi ' pi 

2  pi 



m  pi 
  1  i

2  pi 


(14)

where pi is the percentile value from the OligoDB database for the word i in a bacterial
genome, or the average of the percentile values for the genomes of a taxonomic unit; pi' is
the percentile value of this word in the query sequence as calculated by equation 13; and mi
is an indicator variable equal to 0 if pi ≥ 0.5 and equal to 1 if pi < 0.5. Thus, the denominator
is the maximum possible distance. D values fall in the range from 0 to 10.
Consider the following example: let the 10-mer TTAAAGAAAA be distributed in the
concatenated cluster sequence with the frequency 2.81 words per 100 Kbp and let the 8-mer
TCTTTTAA occur 6.35 times per 100 Kbp. According to equation 13, the percentile value of
the word TTAAAGAAAA is:
p

ln(2.81)  4.5ln(10)  9
 .79
3

(15)

and for the word TCTTTTAA the percentile value is:
p

ln(6.35)  4.5ln(8)  9
 .74
3

(16)

Next D is calculated by equation 14. The motivation for using D values rather than Euclidian
distances is based on the fact that the observed frequency of occurrence of words in the

40

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

clustered reads is frequently lower than in the original genome due to asymmetric
distribution of word frequencies. Another factor that contributes to this observation is that
the clusters of metagenomic DNA reads often contain fragments from more than one
organism. This leads to false similarity of metagenomic sequences to taxa where the
signature words are uncommon. To remove this bias, the equation 14 was constructed so
that the difference between pi’ and pi is given less weight if pi’ is smaller than pi than if pi’ is
larger than pi.
To evaluate the discriminative power of the algorithms, several simulated metagenomic
datasets were prepared using MetaSim. Then DNA reads were clustered by LikelyBin.
The first set was a simple random selection of 50 DNA fragments of the chromosome of
Bacillus subtilis 168 [NC_000964]. The total length of all the fragments was 691 Kbp. The
OligoDB program was used to compare the compositional similarity of these randomly
selected sequences with the original chromosome and the closely related organisms of the
genus Bacillus and class Firmicutes. The obtained distances are shown in Table 2.

*In this and the following tables the filter settings for the program were as follows: only the top 100
words of 8 to 12-mers with the sequence similarity ≤ 30 % were considered. Further, one nucleotide
shifted words and one nucleotide shorter constituent words were filtered out as in the filter setting
window in Fig. 6.

Table 2. Identification of DNA fragments generated from the B. subtilis chromosome.
For the next test, two quite distant organisms were selected: Burkholderia cenocepacia AU1054
[NC_008062] and Psychrobacter arcticus 273-4 [NC_007204]. 552 genomic fragments with an
average length of 500 bp were generated randomly by MetaSim from the B. cenocepacia
chromosome and 448 fragments of the same average length were obtained from the
P. arcticus chromosome. All these fragments were mixed together and used as the input for
LikelyBin. These randomly generated genomic fragments were then grouped by DNA
composition similarity into 13 clusters. The two biggest clusters contained DNA fragments
that were generated exclusively from one origin: 347 of the fragments generated from
B. cenocepacia were grouped into cluster A and 437 of the fragments from the P. arcticus
chromosome were in cluster B. Now, the OligoDB algorithm was used to identify the
organisms most similar to the cluster. For the comparative analysis several representatives
of - and -Proteobacteria were selected (Table 3).

Table 4. Identification of a chimerical cluster A that contains DNA fragments from
P. haloplanktis and S. enterica, and a monophyletic cluster B containing fragments of the
S. enterica genome.
The clusters were identified correctly; however, the separation of genomic fragments of
P. arcticus (Cluster B) from other close relative organisms of genera Psychrobacter,
Psychromonas and Pseudoalteromonas was not reliable. An additional round of identification is
needed where the signature words are selected specifically to distinguish between these
organisms.
The next set of DNA fragments was generated from two genomes of -Proteobacteria:
Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC125 [NC_007481] and Salmonella enterica CT18 [NC_003198].
LikelyBin clustered the fragments into 49 clusters. Half of the clusters contained sequences
generated from both chromosomes. The two biggest clusters were selected for analysis by the
OligoDB algorithm. Cluster A contains 166 fragments of the P. haloplanktis chromosome and 9
sequences originating from S. enterica. Cluster B contains 195 DNA fragments generated from
S. enterica only. Results of the identification are shown in Table 4.
Both of these clusters were identified correctly. The mix of two organisms in Cluster A
yields D values that are higher than all other examples in this paper. D values calculated for
more complex chimerical clusters were around 5; indicating that it will be difficult to
associate such a set of sequences with a specific taxonomic unit.

2.4 Stratigraphic analysis of bacterial genomes
DNA molecules encoding functional enzymes, transcriptional regulators and virulence
factors are fluxing through the bacterial taxonomic walls. They endow environmental and
clinical strains of bacteria with new unexpected properties. Lateral genetic exchange,
particularly of drug tolerance genes has been recognized for a long time; however the
ontology of genomic islands and their donor-recipient relations remain generally obscure
because of methodological problems. Horizontally transferred genes are highly mutable and
the mobilome entities having been inserted into host chromosomes undergo multiple events
of fragmentation, partial duplications and deletions. Even prediction of insertion sites in
host chromosomes remained to be a challenge.
Genome linguistics methods are applicable to study and visualize intrinsic relationships
between mobile genetic elements in bacterial genomes. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a
bacterial pathogen which is a leading cause of human death worldwide, was selected as a
subject for this study. Emergence and evolution of this deadly pathogen are still ambiguous
and not fully understood even after having done the sequencing and comparative studies on
multiple strains of this genus.

Fig. 7. GIs identified in Mycobacterium genomes and other organisms share compositional
similarity. GIs identified in Mycobacteria are represented by white nodes and species of
other genera by grey nodes. Each node represents one GI tagged by NC number of the host
organism as in NCBI followed by the reference number of GIs as in GEI-DB. The edges
depicted by green halo link GIs sharing similar DNA sequences longer than 100 bp

incorporates executable files of Graphviz 2.26.3 for Windows.

2.4.1 Identification and grouping of mycobacterial genomic islands
Linguistic methods were applied to study the distribution of genomic islands (GIs) in
complete genome sequences of Mycobacterium. GIs were identified by SeqWord Gene Island
Sniffer (SWGIS available at www.bi.up.ac.za/SeqWord/sniffer/). The identified GIs were
grouped by compositional similarity of oligonucleotide usage (OU) patterns (Fig. 7). They
were further pair-wise compared by blast2seq and the proteins encoded by GIs’ genes were
searched by BLASTp through the local databases of bacterial, plasmid and phage proteins.
The latter analysis was performed to check if the GIs that cluster together share syntenic
genes and to also deduce the types of genes that are most frequently transferred
horizontally across species and genus borders.
In genomes of virulent and environmental Mycobacterium multiple genomic islands were
identified which share both sequence and OU similarity (Fig. 7). An exception is M. leprae
which genomic islands were unrelated to GIs of other Mycobacteria (data not shown but check
http://anjie.bi.up.ac.za/geidb/geidb-home.php). In Fig. 7 GIs identified in M. tuberculosis, M.
bovis, M. marinum, M. vanbaalenii, M. abscessus and M. smegmatis are represented by white
nodes and those of species of other genera by grey nodes. Each node represents one GI tagged
by NC accession number of the host organism as in NCBI followed by colons and reference
numbers of GIs as in GEI-DB (http://anjie.bi.up.ac.za/geidb/geidb-home.php). Furthermore,
six GIs identified in M. tuberculosis, M. bovis and M. marinum (framed in Fig. 2) share similarity
in both DNA sequence and OU with GIs distributed among -Proteobacteria, particularly to
those of Rhizobium and Agrobacterium.
2.4.2 Stratigraphic analysis of genomic inserts
To determine the relative time of GI insertions, the similarity in OU patterns of GIs and
corresponding host chromosomes was calculated for all organisms. The results are
depicted by grey gradient colors in Fig. 8. GIs that significantly deviate from their hosts
(recent inserts) are shown dark grey; and those that already underwent genomic
amelioration (Lawrence & Ochman, 1997) are shown light grey. Most mycobacterial GIs
revealed to be ancient inserts that is in consistence with the fact that they are shared by
different species. Few of the GIs that showed to be in possession of OU patterns similar to
GIs of Rhizobium and Agrobacterium are relatively recent acquisitions. Comparison of the
patterns of the GIs and host genomes was revised in order to determine donor-recipient
relationships between these organisms (Fig. 9). The analysis revealed that these
mycobacterial GIs are compositionally more similar to the chromosomes and mobilomes
of Agrobacterium and that they are most likely originated from this source as indicated in
Fig. 9.
43 Mycobacterial GIs (unframed in Fig. 2) contain 910 annotated genes among which 386
were hypothetical or unknown. Functional genes are listed in Table 5. Predominance of
phage related genes suggests that these GIs are mostly prophages. Genes that are harboured
by the GIs of the -Proteobacteria origin (framed in Fig. 2) encode several transferases,
esterases, mmcH proteins and hypothetical proteins organized into operon structures
(Fig. 10), which may be involved in the biosynthesis of some yet unknown compounds.

Table 5. Proteins encoded by genes in ancient GIs of Mycobacterium.
Protein BLAST analysis of Mycobacterial GIs retrieved similarities in proteins shared with a
great variety of bacterial plasmids and phages, particularly in the plasmid pSOL1 from
Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824. Acquisition of genetic materials from intracellular
parasitic and symbiotic species of -Proteobacteria by an ancestral strain of Mycobacterium
may be an event that had triggered the evolution of former saprophytic organisms towards
the parasitic lifestyle.

2.4.3 Overview of the horizontal gene transfer in the bacterial world
The exchange of genetic material was found to have occurred in different domains of life:
Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya (Choi and Kim, 2007). Horizontal gene transfer, defined as a

46

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

mechanism that promotes the transfer of foreign genomic segments between lineages was
found to be relatively common in prokaryotes and less common in higher-order organisms.
The transfer of operational genes is a continual process and is far more important in
prokaryotic diversity of different sources (Jain et al., 1999; Ochman, 2000). For horizontal
gene transfer to become a success, the acquisition of foreign DNA segments must be
counterbalanced by DNA loss. Acquired DNA providing functions that are beneficial to the
host may be maintained, while DNA providing less beneficial functions may be lost
(Lawrence, 1999). Mobile genetic elements possess genes that contribute to bacterial
speciation and adaptation to different niches, but also carry with them factors that
contribute to the bacteria’s fitness traits, secondary metabolism, antibiotic resistance and
symbiotic interactions (Dobrindt et al., 2004; Mantri & Williams, 2004) that are of medical
and agricultural importance.
The transfer of GIs occurs through three mechanisms: transformation, conjugation and
transduction. These mechanisms mediate the movement and transfer of DNA segments
intercellularly. Conjugation and transduction are the common players in genetic transfer.
They require mobile elements such as plasmids and bacteriophages to transfer genetic
elements along with the sequence features of their donor to recipient cells (Hacker &
Carniel, 2001). Upon transfer, these genetic elements get established into the recipient cell
either as self replicating elements or by getting integrated into the chromosome either by
homologous or illegitimate recombination techniques (Dutta and Pan, 2002; Beiko et al.,
2005). Transformation, unlike conjugation and transduction does not require any form of a
vector to transport genomic elements between bacteria. It is mediated by the uptake of a
naked DNA in the environment. The uptake usually takes place upon the release of DNA
from decomposing and disrupted cell, or viral particles, or even excretions from living cells
(Thomas & Nielsen, 2005).
DNA composition comparisons between lineages have uncovered that genes acquired by
the above mechanisms display features that are distinct from those of their recipient
genomes (Hacker and Carniel, 2001; van Passel et al., 2006). Genes acquired by horizontal
transfer can often display atypical sequence characteristics and a restricted phylogenetic
distribution among related strains, thereby producing a scattered phylogenetic distribution
(Ochman et al., 2000; Dutta and Pan, 2002). Bacterial species are variable in their overall GC
content but the genes in genomes of particular species are fairly uniform with respect to
their base composition patterns and frequencies of oligonucleotides (Ochman et al., 2000).
The phylogenetic aspect of similarity in base composition among closely related species
arises from their common origin. Similarity is also influenced by genome specific mutational
pressures that act upon their genes to promote the maintenance of composition stability.
Native or core genes in a given organism exhibit homogeneous OU content and codon
usage, while foreign genes display atypical characteristic features shared with their
mobilomes (phages and conjugative plasmids) or previous host organisms for the genetic
segments which were mobilized and integrated by mobilomes (Davenport et al., 2009).
Compositional specificity of GIs allows their precise identification by the SWGIS program
(see above in this chapter). In this work SWGIS was used to search each prokaryotic genome
for foreign inserts based on the comparisons of tetranucleotide usage patterns, whereby the
frequencies of particular tetramers are compared with expected occurrences of the same
tetramers throughout the whole genome. Identified GIs were stored to GEI-DB
(http://anjie.bi.up.ac.za/geidb/geidb-home.php) that contains a set of 3518 precalculated
GIs identified in 637 prokaryotic genomes. All these GIs were clustered by the

Linguistic Approaches for Annotation, Visualization and
Comparison of Prokaryotic Genomes and Environmental Sequences

47

compositional OU pattern similarity that is believed to represent their common ancestry.
Similarity between GIs was calculated as 100 – D(%), where D(%) was found by the equation
4. GIs which share more than 75% of similarity were grouped together. Groups of GIs and
their distribution among bacteria are shown in Fig. 11.
GIs were identified in all bacterial classes. There are more GIs from E. coli and other
Enterobacteria and -Proteobacteria that partially may be explained by a biased
overrepresentation of these microorganisms among other sequenced genomes in the
GenBank database. E. coli, Shigella and Salmonella share GIs of one common origin but GIs
found in other species often showed to have originated from several different origins. For
example, GIs from Pseudomonas form several separate clusters associated with either other Proteobacteria or -Proteobacteria. GIs of -Proteobacteria and Firmicutes show extreme
diversity. Brucella, Agrobacterium and Rhizobium share several unrelated pools of their
mobilomes. Relations which were found between GIs of Mycobacterium and those of
Agrobacterium and Rhizobium have been discussed above in detail. GIs of Prochlorococcus and
Nostoc cyanobacteria most likely originated from marine -Proteobacteria, but GIs of
Synechococcus are very specific and share no similarity with any other microorganisms.

represents one GI. Genera of -Proteobacteria are shown in light blue (enterobacteria
Escherichia, Shigella and Salmonella), cyan (Pseudomonas) and dark blue (marine bacteria
Shewanella, Hahella, Pseudoalteromonas and Alcanivorax); -Proteobacteria Agrobacterium,
Brucella, Neisseria, Rhizobium and Synorhizobium are depicted by magenta nodes;
Firmicutes (Bacillus, Clostridium, Geobacillus and Streptococcus) – orange; Actinobacteria
(Corynebacterium and Mycobacterium) – yellow; Cyanobacteria (Prochlorococcus, Nostoc and
Synechococcus) – green. Nodes representing other organisms are white. Black edges link
nodes which share strong OU similarity above 75% and grey edges represent weaker
similarity below 75%.

48

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

It may be concluded that GIs indeed may flux through the bacterial taxonomic walls but not
in a random fashion. Several species and genera share pools of horizontally transferred
genetic elements, which include pathogenicity, antibiotic resistance, O-antigen synthesis and
catabolic GIs, whereas the genetic exchange between other groups of microorganisms is
seemed very unlikely. Detailed analysis of gene exchange pathways among microorganisms
will shed light on the roles played by the horizontal gene transfer in the evolution and
pathogenicity of bacteria.
26732 proteins encoded by GIs’ genes used in this study were pair-wise compared by
BLASTp. The bit-score results were used to produce clusters of proteins by Markov
clustering algorithm (MCL) (Vlasblom & Wodak, 2009). MCL with an inflation parameter of
1.8 produced 10837 clusters, however, many of them were of a single hypothetical protein.
Due to the large amount of hypothetical and unknown genes in the database not all of these
clusters would present biologically significant data. Top 24 clusters containing more than 50
proteins were chosen as significant to represent categories of proteins which are most often
mobilized and transferred horizontally among bacteria. Besides phage related proteins
which are in a majority, the most frequently bacteria acquire ABC-transporters,
transcriptional regulators including GGDEF diguanylates, polysaccharide and O-antigen
biosynthesis proteins, dehydrogenases and outer membrane proteins (Table 6).

3. Conclusion
Comparative genomics exploits the methods of two major categories based on the analysis
of composition and sequence similarity. Having been developed at the beginning of the
genomics era, sequence similarity comparison by BLAST (Altschul, 1990) and FASTA
(Pearson, 1995), and sequence composition simulation by Markov Chain Models (Schbath,
2000) remain the algorithms of first choice. The algorithms for sequence similarity
comparison are widely used because of speed, more straightforward statistics and a clearer
biological relevance of sequence alignment based considerations. However, a number of
practical tools based on OU statistics have become publicly available. Several novel OU
analytical tools of the SeqWord project for genome visualization, genomic island detection
and identification of unknown sequences have been presented in this chapter.
Composition based methods are termed genome linguistics as they deal with frequencies of
words written as chains of given alphabets of nucleotides or amino acids of variable lengths.
Genome linguistic approaches may complement or even outperform the sequence similarity

comparison in clustering DNA reads (Kislyuk et al., 2009) and detecting inserts of genomic
islands (Hsiao et al., 2003). These approaches have also been shown to be instrumental in
viral metagenomics (Delwart, 2007). During composition based analysis, longer DNA
sequences are rather preferred to shorter ones for the word distribution statistics to be
reliable.
DNA similarity vanishes much faster in phylogenetically distant organisms than the OU
composition does, especially in highly variable virus, phage, plasmids and genomic islands.
Protein similarity may mislead binning or identification of unknown sequences for it mostly
reflects the functional conservation of protein domains rather than the taxonomic unity.
Another common limitation of the similarity based methods is that the sequence
identification is possible only if a homologous DNA or protein sequence is present in the
searched database. On the contrary, the genome specific OU pattern is a pervasive property
of the whole genome (Jernigan & Baran, 2002) that allows binning of DNA reads to their
putative origin even if they do not share any significant sequence similarity.
The advancement in genome sequencing technologies made large scale sequencing
affordable for many laboratories. An attractive approach of alignment-independent
phylogenetic studies based on the comparison of OU patterns was discussed in several
publications and a number of web-based services were proposed (Chapus et al., 2005). We
suggest rather a cautious use of these methods as a significant convergence of OU patterns
was observed between unrelated organisms. For instance, Pseudomonas and Mycobacterium
share similar OU patterns. Furthermore, a wider application of OU patterns is hindered by
the absence of any noteworthy mathematical models simulating the evolutionary changes in
OU patterns between organisms in contrast to sequence similarity methods which provide
plenty of models of nucleotide and amino acid substitutions. Development and testing of
such models is the task that urgently needs to be looked into to advance applicability of
genome linguistic approaches.

1. Introduction
Due to the advances in structural biology research, a large number of protein structures
have been solved in the last decade. In the same time, we also witness a rapidly growing
number of structures of unknown function being deposited in the PDB. As a result, the ability
to predict protein function from its structure becomes increasingly important in
computational biology.
The conventional comparative methods(for example, Laskowski, Watson et al. 2005;
Watson, Sanderson et al. 2007) for identifying functional sites rely on evolutional
information like homologous structures of known function or the known catalytic templates.
However, these approaches are not applicable to these novel structures. One needs to
develop ingenious approaches that do not rely on evolutionary information.
Recently, several groups(Amitai, Shemesh et al. 2004; Ben-Shimon & Eisenstein 2005;
Sacquin-Mora, Laforet et al. 2007; Huang, Yu et al. 2011) developed novel approaches to
predict the active sites of enzymes from a single structure without using any homologous
structures or known catalytic templates. The basic idea of their approaches is simple: they
first identify certain structural or dynamical features that are unique to the active sites; they
then further refine this relationship such that it can be used to accurately predict the enzyme
catalytic sites. For example, Pietrokovski and co-workers(Amitai, Shemesh et al. 2004)
transformed the protein structure into residue interaction graphs, with each amino acid
residue represented as a graph node and the interaction between them as a graph edge.
They then computed the network closeness of each residue. They found that most catalytic
residues are associated with the network centrality. Ben-Shimon and Eisenstein(Ben-Shimon
& Eisenstein 2005), analyzing 175 enzymes, observed that most catalytic residues are near
the enzyme centroid. Based on these results, they developed novel methods to predict
catalytic sites from a single structure.
The aim of this review is to show that this peculiar relationship between catalytic sites and
the structure centroid or its network centrality can be accounted for by the dynamical
properties of the catalytic residues, which are in general more rigid than other residues. In
addition, we will discuss the recent studies (Halle 2002; Shih, Huang et al. 2007; Huang, Shih
et al. 2008; Lin, Huang et al. 2008; Lu, Huang et al. 2008) on the surprisingly close link

54

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

between protein structure and its thermal fluctuations. These studies showed that the
atomic thermal fluctuations and motional correlations can be extracted directly from protein
structures without using any mechanical models.
The outline of this review is as follows: first, we will cover the recent works on extracting
average dynamical properties directly from protein structures. This part occupies a
significant portion of the text, since it provides not only theoretical foundations for but also
physical insights on what we will introduce later – the prediction of the active sites from a
single structure, which is a straightforward application of the results discussed in the first
part. Finally, we will show that the rigidity of the active site residues can be inferred from
the generally accepted theory of the mechanism of enzyme catalysis.

2. Atomic thermal fluctuations and motional correlations in protein
The motional correlation between atom i and j is given by

C ij ~  ri   rj

(1)

where  ri  ri  ri is the displacement of the instantaneous position ri of the atom i from its
equilibrium position

ri . Knowledge of the motional correlations in protein provides

valuable information about the relationship between protein dynamics and its function. For
example, dynamical correlation networks may account for the long-range effects of faraway
mutation sites on the functional site (Saen-Oon, Ghanem et al. 2008; Ishida 2010) or protein
allostery(Fidelak, Ferrer et al. 2010; Amaro, Sethi et al. 2007; Tsai, del Sol et al. 2008). The
diagonal terms or the auto-correlation terms in Eq. 1 describe atomic fluctuations. They can
be obtained as B-factors from X-ray crystallography refinement or order parameters from
NMR. The B-factor in its isotropic form is given formally as B  (8 2 / 3)  r   r .
2.1 Normal mode analysis
To compute the correlation matrix, one needs to evaluate the second derivatives of the
potential energy of the protein structure. In molecular mechanics, the protein structure is
usually modelled by analytical potential functions(Warshel 2002). In general, the bonding
energy is approximated by a harmonic function, i.e., 21 K b (b  b0 )2 , where Kb is the force

constant, b and b0 are the bond length and the equilibrium bond length, respectively. The
bending interaction is approximated by 21 K (  0 )2 , where K is the bending force
constant,  and 0 are the bending angle and the equilibrium bending angle, respectively.
The torsional interaction is modelled by a sinusoidal functions: K  1  cos(n   )

2

,

where

K is the torsional force constant,  and  are the torsional angle and the reference torsional
angles, respectively, and n is the torsional periodicity. The non-bonded van der Waals
(VDW) interaction is approximated by the Lennard-Jones function (also referred to as a 6-12
function):   r0 r 

12

 2  r0 r  , where r is the distance between atoms, and  and r0 are the
6

VDW parameters related to the potential depth and its minimum distance. The electrostatic
interaction is described by the Coulomb equation: 332 qi q j / r , where qi and qj are the

charges of the atom pair and r their separation. The complete potential function is usually
referred to as a force field:

The Hessain matrix H is the square matrix of the second derivatives of the potential
energy U / xi x j , where xi and xj are the Cartesian coordinates of the atoms of the
protein structure. Diagonalization of the Hessian matrix, i.e., U 1HU  L , gives the
normal mode frequencies L and normal mode vectors U, which describe harmonic
vibrational motions of the structure. The overall molecular motion can be described as a
linear combination of these normal modes. These frequencies and vectors define different
modes of harmonic motions occurring in a protein structure. The above procedure is
referred to as normal mode analysis (NMA) (Brooks & Karplus 1983; Levitt, Sander et al.
1985; Go 1990; Ma 2004). The correlations between atomic fluctuations given by Eq. 1 can
be calculated from the normal modes. Mathematically, the correlation matrix is the
pseudo-inverse of the Hessian matrix.
One limitation of NMA is its assumption that motions are harmonic. This may not be valid
in the case of large-amplitude conformational dynamics in protein which are presumably
highly anharmonic(Ma 2005). Furthermore, NMA needs to be carried out in an energyminimized structure. This is to avoid the occurrence of the unphysical complex-valued
normal mode frequencies. However, minimization may cause significant conformational
deformations due to the inherent deficiencies of the force field.
2.2 Elastic network model
Elastic network model (ENM) (Tirion 1996), a simplified version of NMA, can be directly
applied to the protein structures without energy minimization. In ENM, every atom is
connected to any atoms (except itself, of course) as long as they are within a certain
threshold distance (usually 12 Å) of the given atom. ENM does not distinguish between
bonded interactions (such as bonding, bending or torsional interactions) and nonbonded
interactions (such as VDW or electrostatic interactions). All interactions are represented by a
harmonic function with a uniform force constant. Since all interactions in ENM are assumed
to be of covalent nature, i.e., the atom pairs are connected by a harmonic force, this is
equivalent to assuming a relatively rigid protein structure. We will comment more on that
later.
A number of ENM variants has been developed: the Gaussian Network Model (GNM)
(Bahar, Atilgan et al. 1997), Anisotropic Network Model (ANM) (Atilgan, Durell et al. 2001)
and Quantized Elastic Deformational Model (Ming, Kong et al. 2002). Despite the simplicity
of ENM, it predicts relatively accurate correlated motions in proteins. ENM has recently
become a popular tool to analyze protein dynamics (Zheng, Brooks et al. 2007; Yang, Song et
al. 2009; Zheng & Thirumalai 2009).
Recently, Hwang and co-workers (Shih, Huang et al. 2007; Huang, Shih et al. 2008; Lin,
Huang et al. 2008; Lu, Huang et al. 2008) developed even simpler models to calculate the
correlations between the atomic fluctuations in proteins directly from their structures
without using mechanical models, or performing energy minimization or matrix

diagonalization. They are the Protein Fixed-Point Model and the Weighted Contact Number
Model, which will be discussed in the next sections.
2.3 The protein fixed-point model
In the Protein Fixed-Point (PFP) model, the protein structure is characterized by the PFP
profile R
R  ( r1  r0 , r2  r0 , , rN  r0 )

(3)

where ri is the coordinate of C atom of the i th residue, r0 is the fixed point and N is the
number of residues. The fixed point r0 is identified with the centroid of the protein chain,

r0   i ri / N . Hwang and co-workers (Shih, Huang et al. 2007; Lu, Huang et al. 2008)

showed that the correlation matrix C is well approximated by RT R , where RT is the
transpose of R , i.e.,
Cij  ri  rj

(4)

where ri  ri  r0 and rj  rj  r0 . The motional correlation between atoms is the inner
product of the vectors radiating from the centroid to the respective atoms. The B-factor, i.e.,
the diagonal element, is proportional to the square of the distance to the centroid(Kundu,
Melton et al. 2002).
In the PFP model, the tricky issue is to determine the fixed points. In the case of a single
domain protein, the fixed point is simply the centroid (or the center of mass) of the whole
structure. However, in the case of multidomain protein or a protein complex, the fixed point
is defined as the centroid of the structure module. There may be more than one fixed point
since the protein structure may be composed of a number of modules. The structure
modules are identified with either the structure domains or the biological units. The
coordinates of biological units can be retrieved from either PDB or PQS(Henrick & Thornton
1998). Though the biological units are not uniquely defined, the PDB and PQS biological
units agree on 82% of entries(Xu, Canutescu et al. 2006).
The general procedures to determine the structural modules of a protein structures go as
follow: each protein chain is checked for its domains through the use of the Protein Domain
Parser (PDP)(Alexandrov & Shindyalov 2003); if the PDP domain is not defined, the SCOP
database(Murzin, Brenner et al. 1995) will be searched; if not found, the CATH
database(Orengo, Michie et al. 1997) will be searched. If the chain is not a multidomain
chain, it will be checked whether it is a part of a protein complex or a biological from PDB or
PQS.
In Figure 1, we compare the computed PFP profiles with the experimental X-ray B-factors.
Both the PFP and the B-factor profiles are expressed in terms of the Z-scores. In the case of
the B-factor, the Z-score is defined as: ZB  ( B  B) /  B , where B and  B are the mean and
standard deviation of the B-factor. The Z-score of the PFP profile is defined similarly. For a
dataset comprising 972 high-resolution X-ray structures with pairwise sequence identity ≤
25%, the correlation coefficient between the computed and the X-ray B-factors is 0.59. There
are 727 out of 972 of proteins (around 75%) having a correlation coefficient ≥ 0.5. In

On the Structural Characteristics
of the Protein Active Sites and Their Relation to Thermal Fluctuations

57

comparison, GNM yields a correlation coefficient of 0.56 and the fraction of proteins with a
correlation coefficient ≥ 0.5 is 69% for the same data set(Lu, Huang et al. 2008).
Figure 2 compares the PFP correlations with the NMA maps computed by GROMAC(Van
Der Spoel, Lindahl et al. 2005). The agreements are excellent.

1fup:a (bottom row). The colors are coded according to the rainbow spectrum. A more reddish
color indicates a more negative correlation, while a more bluish color a more positive correlation.
2.4 The weighted contact number methods

The contact number (CN) of the residue i is defined as ni   j  i H (r0  rij ) , where r0 is the
N

cutoff distance, rij is the distance between the C atoms of residue i and j, and H ( r ) is the
Heaviside step function defined as: H ( r )  1 if r  0 and H (r )  0 otherwise. Despite its
popular uses in computational structural biology (Miyazawa & Jernigan 1984; Halle 2002),
the CN has one major shortcoming: it treats the contribution equally of every contact atom,
regardless of its distance to the center atom.
To take distance into consideration, Hwang and co-workers(Lin, Huang et al. 2008) define a
weighted contact number (WCN) as
N

i  

(5)

They showed that the reciprocal WCN profiles better reproduce the B-factor profiles and
that the correlation between residue i and residue j is well approximated by

The WCN model may be a little more computationally expensive than the PFP model, but it
can be complemented as an automatic procedure. This is in contrast to the PFP model,
which requires manual intervention to define the centroids.
Figure 3 compares the computed WCN B-factor profiles with the experimental X-ray B-factors.
The WCN model predicts better B-factors than the PFP model, the original CN model (Halle
2002) and the GNM. For the same dataset stated before, the WCN model yields a correlation
coefficient of 0.61 with 79% of proteins having a correlation coefficient ≥ 0.5.
Figure 4 compares the WCN and the NMA correlation maps. The agreements are excellent.

2.5 More on the structural and B-factor profiles
It is hardly surprising that an atom's thermal fluctuation as quantified by its B-factor
should be somehow related in a qualitative way to its structural features, such as its
packing environment or its position relative to the structure centroid. However, it is
unexpected that the B-factor profiles and the structural profiles (i.e., the PFP and the
WCN profiles) are so similar that, in some cases, one profile can be put on the top of the
other with little discernible differences. It is even more surprising that this was done
without information of the amino acid sequence.
Figure 5 compares the distributions of the correlation of B-factors with the original CN
model, the WCN model and the PFP model for a dataset comprising 972 non-homologous
structures. The B-factors distributions are computed using only C atoms.
The good agreement between the computed and the X-ray B-factors indicates that the Bfactors can be derived solely from the protein backbone to a relatively high accuracy. A
study(Lenin, Parthasarathy et al. 2000) showed that the variation in the atomic fluctuations,
quantified by the B-factors, of a given protein segment only weakly depends on that of its
amino acid. Note that the ENM (Tirion 1996; Bahar, Atilgan et al. 1997; Ming, Kong et al.
2002) also computes accurate B-factors without using the amino acid sequence.

On the Structural Characteristics
of the Protein Active Sites and Their Relation to Thermal Fluctuations

61

While the amino acid sequence completely determines the 3-dimeniosnal structure of a
protein, the thermal fluctuations and the motional correlations in a protein can be
determined from its structure without its side-chain groups. The physical meaning of this is
not clear and further study is definitely needed to clarify this issue.

3. The rigidity of enzyme catalytic sites
Enzymes accelerate chemical reactions by reducing the activation barrier. To achieve this,
the enzyme structures are optimized through evolution to partially pre-organize their
catalytic residues such that their charge distributions will stabilize the transition site
complex, thus reducing the reorganization energy required for reaching the transition
state(Warshel 1978; Warshel, Naray-Szabo et al. 1989; Warshel, Sharma et al. 2006). The
reorganization energy is related to the activation free energy through the Marcus
equation(Marcus 1956; Marcus 1956; Marcus 1957; Sumi & Marcus 1986):
G  

   G0 2
4

(7)

where G  is the activation free energy, G0 the free energy difference between the
reactant and the product states and  the reorganization energy. Eq. 7 states that the
reduction of the reorganization energy  will result in smaller activation free energy G  .

B-factor profiles based on the original CN model (white), the PFP (grey) and the WCN

length > 60. All of them are high-resolution X-ray structures with resolution ≤ 2.0 Å and
R-factors ≤ 0.2. All chains are of pair-wise sequence identity ≤ 25%. This figure is adapted
from Lin, Huang et al. 2008.

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

Hence, the active site residues are expected to be more rigid than the non-active site residues.
And this has been verified by a number of studies: Yuan and co-workers (Yuan, Zhao et al.
2003) compared the B-factors of the active site sites with those of other non-active site residues of
69 apo-enzymes. They found that the active site residues indeed have lower B-factors. Analyzing
a set of a set of 98 enzymes, Yang and Bahar (Yang & Bahar 2005) found that the catalytic sites
usually occur in the global hinge centers and have low translational mobility. Recently, Lavery
and co-workers(Sacquin-Mora, Laforet et al. 2007) showed that the force needed to displace a
catalytic residue is usually larger than that to displace a non-catalytic residue.
3.1 Prediction of active site residue from a single structure
Since B-factors quantify structure flexibility, it may be tempting to use B-factors to
distinguish between the active site residues and other residues. However, The B-factor
values are affected by various experimental conditions such as temperature, crystallization
and structural refinement.

Fig. 6. (A) The Zb profiles and (B) the Zw profiles of 3 lysozymes: 6lyt (thick solid), 2bqo
(dotted) and 2lzt (thin solid). Here Zw is the normalized WCN. This figure is adapted from
Huang, Yu et al. (2011).

On the Structural Characteristics

Figure 6 compares the B-factor and the WCN profiles of several X-ray structures of
lysozyme. Despite their almost identical structures -- their root-mean-square-deviations are
within 0.6-0.8 Å, their B-factor profiles are very different.
On the other hand, their WCN profiles look almost identical. The B-factor is obviously not
robust enough for predicting active site residues. The WCN profile, which correlates well
with the B-factors but depends only on structure per se, is a much better discriminator for the
catalytic residues.
Hwang and co-workers showed a straightforward application of the WCN profile to
predicting the catalytic residues(Huang, Yu et al. 2011). We will illustrate this with an
example: S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC) (Ekstrom, Mathews et al. 1999),
a critical regulatory enzyme of the polyamine synthetic pathway, has 5 catalytic residues.
They are located in two chains: C82, S229 and H243 in chain A, and E11 and E67 in chain B.
The active site of AdoMetDC is shown in Figure 7.

Fig. 7. The active site of AdoMetDC. Chain A is shown in cyan and chain B in magenta. The
catalytic residues are labelled.
The WCN profile of AdoMetDC is shown in Figure 8. It should be noted that the WCN
profile is computed for an incomplete structure -- many residues are missing in the X-ray
structure of AdoMetDC. Despite this, most catalytic residues but one are located near the
local minima of the WCN profile, as shown in Figure 8. The basic idea of the approach is
simple: to obtain a threshold value for the WCN profile such that the residues whose Zvalues are below the threshold are predicted to be catalytic residues. The threshold Z-value
is determined by minimizing both the false positives and the false negatives of the predicted
catalytic residues(Huang, Yu et al. 2011). The threshold for the WCN profile is -0.9.

empty circles. The red dotted line indicates the threshold value.
3.2 Comparison of structural profiles
Figure 9 compares the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves of 4 structural profiles
for their prediction of the active site residues for a data set comprising 760 X-ray
nonhomologous enzyme structures(Huang, Yu et al. 2011). These profiles are the WCN
profile, the PFP profile, the CN profile and the B-factor profile. The ROC curve is obtained
by plotting the true positive rate (TPR) as a function of the false positive rate (FPR). TPR is
defined as TPR = TP/P, where TP is true positives, i.e., number of correctly predicted
catalytic residues, and P is the positive examples, i.e., the total number of catalytic residues.
FPR is defined as FPR = FP/N, where FP is the false positives, i.e., the number of incorrectly
predicted catalytic residues, and N is the negative examples, i.e., the number of noncatalytic residues. TPR is the sensitivity, while 1 – TPR is the specificity.
The WCN model performs the best among all the models. The PFP model comes in second.
The relatively poor performance of the CN mode underlines the importance of attenuating
the contributions of the neighboring atoms that depend on the distance between the
interacting pair. The B-factor profile performs the worst. To have a feeling for the different
performance between the WCN and the B-factor profiles, we can examine the case of highly
specific predictions, i.e., at 95% specificity, the WCN model gives 52% sensitivity but the Bfactor model gives only 11% sensitivity.
3.3 Other prediction methods
Here we will compare the WCN profile method with other methods in their prediction of
the catalytic residues from a single structure.

On the Structural Characteristics
of the Protein Active Sites and Their Relation to Thermal Fluctuations

65

Fig. 9. The ROC curves of the WCN (ZW), the PPF (ZPFP), the CN (ZCN) and the B-factor (ZB)
profiles for the prediction of catalytic residues.
Lavery and co-workers(Sacquin-Mora, Laforet et al. 2007), using Brownian dynamics
simulation, computed the force needed to move any given amino acid residue with respect
to other residues. They found that catalytic residues are invariably associated with high
force constants. Their method gave 78% sensitivity and 74% specificity for predicting
catalytic residues for a dataset of 98 non-homologous enzymes. In comparison, the WCN
profile method yields 84% sensitivity and 82% specificity (Huang, Yu et al. 2011) for the
same data set. This is quite remarkable, considering the simplicity of the WCN profile
method as compared with the complexity of the Brownian simulation.
Analyzing the normal modes of a set of enzymes, Yang and Bahar (Yang & Bahar 2005)
found that that the catalytic sites are usually of lower translational mobility than other
residues, and that these catalytic sites generally coincide with the global hinge centers
predicted by the GNM. Their method gave a sensitivity of 56% for a dataset of 24 enzymes.
For the same data set, the WCN profile method gives 73% sensitivity and 82%
specificity(Huang, Yu et al. 2011).
Ben-Shimon and Eisenstein(Ben-Shimon & Eisenstein 2005) developed a prediction
algorithm called EnSite, based on the finding that the catalytic residues are often found
among the 5% of residues closest to the enzyme centroid. The algorithm of EnSite is
straightforward: it computes only the molecular surface that is close to the centroid,
identifies continuous surface patches and finally ranks them by their area size. EnSite gives
the result in terms of the rank of the correct prediction. This makes it difficult to compare the
EnSite with the WCN profile method. The Pietrokovski's network centrality
approach(Amitai, Shemesh et al. 2004) is similar to EnSite: both are based on the idea that
the catalytic sites are near the center of the protein – be it represented by a structure or a
network. Pietrokovski's approach gives 46.5% sensitivity and 9.4% specificity for a dataset of
178 structures. For a much larger dataset of 760 enzymes, the WCN profile gave 78%
sensitivity and 80% specificity(Huang, Yu et al. 2011).

4. Conclusion
Catalytic residues are associated with a variety of structural or dynamic properties -- they
are closer to the structure centroid, have higher packing density, or have smaller B-factors.
Since the packing density and the centroid distances are closely related to the B-factors(Shih,
Huang et al. 2007; Huang, Shih et al. 2008; Lin, Huang et al. 2008; Lu, Huang et al. 2008), all
these seemingly diversified relationships can be reduced to one conclusion: the catalytic
residues are more rigid. This is consistent with the present theory of enzyme
catalysis(Warshel 1978; Warshel, Naray-Szabo et al. 1989; Warshel, Sharma et al. 2006;
Sigala, Kraut et al. 2008): to accelerate the chemical reactions, the enzyme structures are
optimized through evolution to partially pre-organize their catalytic residues to stabilize the
transition state. As a result, catalytic residues tend to maintain similar conformations in both
the reactant and the transition states. The catalytic residues will be more rigid than other
non-catalytic residues.

1. Introduction
An amino-acid in proteins shows two different, yet mutually dependent faces connected
through the polymer character of a protein in the final product. They are the amino-acid sidechain and its corresponding backbone part. On the level of the side-chains, we often refer to
specific structural arrangements such as hydrophobic cluster motifs, salt-bridge motifs or
hydrogen-bond motifs characterizing various parts of a protein and usually assigned to a
certain function. The backbone on the other hand offers limited, yet general structural motifs –
 and random coil patterns. All of these mentioned amino-acid features contribute to the
synergy demonstrated observably by protein stability and protein function.
Thermal stability is one of the most important features of the structure of a fully folded
protein. It is defined as the difference in the Gibbs free energy between its native and
denaturated states and as such is a function of temperature and implicitly a function of
protein composition and the effect of the environment. Nevertheless, it is necessary to say
that for this function we do not know yet the precise and general form which could be
applicable for a large set of proteins. There have been many attempts to propose an
intuitive, yet productive decomposition of Gibbs free stabilization energy (GFSE) into
simple terms. One of the scenarios utilized for such purposes is that the total free energy is
the sum of the free energies of various atomic groups and the hydrophobic effect. However,
as the free energy is not additive and the fractionation of free energy to independent terms
is difficult, this attempt has been quite unsuccessful.
The utilization of molecular modeling methodology and tools has opened a more systematic
and perhaps more promising approach – the evaluation of the enthalpy term in the equation
for Gibbs free energy with reasonable accuracy (Lazaridis, Archontis, & Karplus, 1995). The
remaining entropy term could be obtained by fitting the corresponding analytical form to
the experimental data. There are basically three different enthalpy contributions that we can
separate. The first comes from the intramolecular interactions between the atoms of
proteins, producing the largest stabilizing enthalpy contribution. The second comes from
the interactions between the molecules of a solvent, and finally the third contribution is the
result of the interactions between the atoms of the solute (protein) and the solvent.

70

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

It is commonly believed that the dominant force of protein folding and therefore the main
stabilizing force of the native structure is the hydrophobic effect (Dill, 1990). However, it has
been insightfully pointed out (Makhatadze et al. 1995) that a water environment destabilizes
folded protein structures and the decomposition of enthalpy shows that the solvation models
introduce significant errors. In these studies, it has been assumed that the denatured state of a
protein can be identified with the fully unfolded state (Makhatadze et al. 1989), where residues
do not interact with each other. Even in light of this hypothesis, the intramolecular interactions
between amino-acids in a protein are expected to contribute significantly to its overall stability.
However, the hypothesis has never been proved and the importance of the intramolecular
interactions would be much higher if the unfolding were considered as “core melting” rather
than “oil-droplet dissolution”. Regardless of the denatured form, the intramolecular
organization of a protein is the result of a subtle balance between the rigidity/flexibility of the
protein backbone and the noncovalent interactions between protein’s side-chains. This result
in conformational unique and stable protein structures as well as the ratio between the
importance of the backbone/side-chain contributions can vary for different proteins.
The main problem of the enthalpy (or the potential energy) approach is that we are unable
to evaluate the enthalpy-entropy compensation; therefore, the theoretically determined
enthalpy contribution should be adjusted in some other way. A realistic method is to
correlate the calculated values with the experimental data obtained by microcalorimetry,
where both the enthalpy and the entropy terms can be determined. On the level of particular
amino-acids, we face the problem of their “denatured-state” definition for the reasonable
decomposition of the free energy on individual amino-acids.
The dissection of the enthalpy contribution which the intra-molecular noncovalent interaction
energy (part of the potential energy) is a component of seems to be a reasonable approach for
the study of the role of the composing amino-acids in protein stabilization. We can decompose
this energy into individual pairwise amino-acid contributions and determine their importance
for protein stability. The evaluation of the interaction energy (of noncovalent origin) between
biomolecules or between their parts is a traditional field of the symbiosis between experiment
and theory, and the methodology is well described and highly developed (Müller-Dethlefs & P
Hobza, 2000). The crucial condition for the success of the theoretical methodology is the
accuracy of the methods utilized. Recently, it has been quite common to evaluate the potential
energy of a protein at the suitable ab initio methodology level, but we are still severely limited
by the size of the protein. Therefore, the Density Functional Theory methods (DFT) are the
most utilized for such purposes ( Riley, 2010). Unfortunately, the DFT methods fail to describe
the noncovalent interactions reasonably mostly because of the missing electron correlation
term. Even the new functionals recently introduced (Kolář, 2010) have failed to describe
properly the noncovalent potential curve mostly in the repulsion and asymptotic regions. Such
inaccuracies can be tolerated at the energy minima, but only a limited number of the
interactions between amino-acids in proteins meet such a requirement. Therefore, only highlevel ab initio methods can be utilized – at least for benchmark studies. As was shown on a set
of representative interactions between amino-acid side-chains in proteins in 2009, empirical
force fields (namely OPLS and AMBER) are suitable for the description of their interaction
(Berka, 2009). Kolar (Kolář, 2010) tested the performance of the energy calculations using MM
on a representative set, S22, and found quite satisfactory agreement between the empirical
force fields and high-level ab initio methods. It was later shown that we can use the empirical
force field with satisfactory accuracy also for the description of the intramolecular interactionenergy distributions for pairs of amino-acid side-chains (Berka, 2010). Still, one has to be aware

Decomposition of Intramolecular Interactions Between Amino-Acids in Globular
Proteins - A Consequence for Structural Classes of Proteins and Methods of Their Classification

71

of the limitations of the force-field methods, namely for subtle cases of the interactions present
in proteins. On the other hand, the utilization of empirical methods decreases the
computational cost and provides an opportunity to investigate the trends presented in
biomolecules if the highest accuracy is not the major issue.
The evaluation of the interaction energy between amino-acid residues resulted in the
interaction energy matrix (IEM) concept being introduced in 2008 (BendováBiedermannová, 2008). The IEM approach was used to identify the key residues for protein
stability in a model system – rubredoxin. The matrix carries information about the energy
and the role of a residue in the protein structure, namely its interaction energy strength,
which is more than the simple distance matrix concept. It also shows how much a certain
residue is a hub within the context of the other interacting amino-acids. The IEM approach
might also open new horizons for the investigations of proteins. The concept could be
incorporated into the methods of protein-structure superpositions (similar to the DALI
approach)(Holm & Sander, 1997) and can shed light on other protein-related issues – for
example protein stability, folding kinetics, foldability and design.
The work presented in this study is based on the calculations of the amino-acid – amino-acid
interaction energies (IEs) between all of the residues in approximately 1400 proteins to
justify the roles of different amino-acids, their backbones and side-chains and their physicalchemical character for structural or stabilization preferences. We especially focused on the
problem of how the interaction energy distributions are related to the secondary-structure
content defined by the CATH (Orengo et al., 1997) and SCOP(Murzin, 1995) criteria.

2. Amino-acids in proteins and their distribution
2.1.1 Representative structure-set selection
All of the protein structures utilized in this study were obtained from the PDB database
(download Jan 31, 2011). We selected only protein molecules with one chain, no ligands,
resolved by the X-ray crystallography method at a minimum resolution of 2.0 A. We also
omitted structures with a 70% sequence identity and higher. The database filter yielded 1531
structures. This number was slightly reduced by inconveniences with file processing to 1358.
The characteristics of the set are illustrated in Figure 1 (size histogram, resolution
histogram).

structures with a particular X-ray resolution; binned by 0.1 A; c) histogram of the sizes of the
structures selected for secondary-structure studies.
Incomplete amino-acid side-chains (missing heavy atoms, disordered) were replaced by
glycine in the cases where backbone atoms were available. Amino-acids with missing

72

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

backbone atoms would have discredited the whole set and were therefore omitted. The
missing hydrogen atoms were added by the Xleap program from the AMBER (Case et al. 2010)
simulation package for pH 7 and the parameters were assigned according to the OPLS FF
(Jorgensen & Rives 1988). The ambiguity of protonation, mainly in the case of histidine, is
discussed later. The structures were optimized using the GROMACS (Hess et al. 2008)
molecular simulation package with the steepest descent algorithm being employed. The
hydrogen atoms were optimized first and then the full optimization of the whole protein in the
gas phase was performed.
To address the question of the residue selectivity for secondary structure motifs, the
structures were classified according to the CATH and SCOP categories and four
representative sets were selected. To prevent the interference of the size and secondary
structure effect, we assured that the structure sets possess the same size distribution.
Hence, the structures pertaining to particular secondary-structure sets were binned
according to their chain length (bin size 50, see Figure 2) and were randomly removed from
the bins until the number of structures in the corresponding bins was the same for all the
sets. This procedure resulted in four sets, each containing 99 structures.
2.1.2 The fragmentation of proteins
To differentiate between the particular types of interactions which every amino-acid can
maintain, we assigned every atom of a residue to one of four attributes according to their
occurrence in the backbone or to their occurrence in certain types of amino-acid side-chains.
The attributes were as follows – BB – backbone atoms, CH – side-chain atoms of charged
residues (asp, glu, lys, arg, his), PO – side-chain atoms of polar residues (asn, gln, thr, ser)
and NP – side-chain atoms of nonpolar and aromatic residues (gly, ala, leu, ile, val, pro, cys,
met, phe, tyr, trp). Such classification provides the lowest number of groups necessary to
discern between interactions characterized by different distance dependencies and orders of
magnitude (different physical characters). On the other hand, breaking residues into more
parts is restrained by the resulting charges of the fragments which would introduce
significant but artificial electrostatic energies. The OPLS force field guarantees that the
backbone (which includes C) and side-chain fragments are neutral. The physical character
of the interaction energies of the aromatic residues is close to those of nonpolar residues.
Hence, taking into account digestibility of presented data, we decided not to increase the
number of attributes.
2.1.3 The Interaction Energy Matrix (IEM) calculation
After all of the structural optimizations, the pairwise interaction energies for all of the
residues at the OPLS level were calculated excluding those between backbones of adjacent
amino-acid in primary structure which were set to zero. The interactions were calculated
separately for the backbones and side-chains as the sum of the interatomic Lennard-Jones
and Coulombic contributions in the gas phase (r=1) using an in-house developed Python
program utilizing the standard libraries. The classification of the amino-acid atoms in four
groups resulted in ten types of mutual interactions – BB-BB, BB-CH, BB-PO, BB-NP,
CH-CH, CH-PO, CH-NP, PO-PO, PO-NP, NP-NP – reflecting the attributes of the
atoms involved. For example, CH-CH represents salt bridges and all of the interactions
between the side-chains of charged residues regardless of their relative distance and
charge sign.

Proteins - A Consequence for Structural Classes of Proteins and Methods of Their Classification

73

Each type of interaction for one protein was represented by one interaction energy matrix,
namely a NxN (where N denotes the number of residues) matrix containing the
interaction energy between the atoms of residues i and j with particular attributes
assigned. It is guaranteed that no interaction energy is counted twice, so the sum of all of
the matrices provides the interaction energy between the corresponding residues.
In order to compare the residual energy content, we have introduced a residue interaction
energy (RIE) characteristic for each residue. The RIE of a certain type is defined as the sum
of all of the interactions the residue can maintain – the sum of all the numbers in a particular
row (or column) in the IEM of that type. At the end, we have ten (NxN dimension, where N
is the number of amino-acids) IEMs of different types in one protein. Most of the IEs are of
course almost zero; some are set as zero by definition.
2.1.4 Representation of data – cumulative distribution functions and histograms
There are two main data representation schemes in this work. Those are as follows:
The distributions of RIEs of a certain type in one protein. For one specific type and one
specific protein set (for example CH-CH in SCOP β), the following procedure was
performed to acquire an average distribution representing the whole set. The non-zero RIEs
calculated from appropriate IEM were sorted independently for each protein and the
distributions were obtained as a plot of the RIE against the residue rank in the sorted list
normalized to one. To enable the averaging of the distributions, we represented each one by
1001 equally distant (on the rank coordinate) points between 0 and 1 (instead of for example
N in the case of RIE BB). The RIE for each point was obtained by linear interpolation using
the nearest two points of the calculated distribution. The averaged distribution was obtained
by averaging the RIEs of the corresponding points of the curves of all of the proteins
pertaining to the set. The inverse of the averaged distribution is a quite smooth cumulative
distribution function representing the average for the set.
The distributions of the RIEs of a certain type for a particular amino-acid were sampled
from all of the 1358 proteins. The RIEs of a particular type and AA were sampled from all
the proteins and binned to yield quite smooth histograms.
2.2 Secondary-structure dependence
The RIE distribution of a particular type in a protein describes the distribution of the energetic
importance of the residues. An average distribution also characterizes the particular type of
interaction in the ensemble – the fraction of the key residues, their importance, and the fraction
of the residues with repulsive interactions. The magnitude interval of a distribution is a very
important parameter. It contains information about the interaction strength in the native states
of the proteins. Unfortunately, this information does not denote the contribution of particular
interactions to stability as it lacks information on the denatured state.
The shape of the distribution determines the pressure exerted on a residue and might help
estimate the actual contribution of the corresponding interactions to protein stability. It is
not surprising that the BB RIEs correlate with the secondary structures as the
classifications indirectly use the BB RIEs. However, the differences are smaller than one
might expect. It is also clear that none of the interactions other than BB is affected by the
secondary-structure content.
From Figure 2, it can be concluded that the difference between the CATH and SCOP
classifications is more significant mainly in the case of α proteins. Figures 3 and 4 show all
of the types of distributions for a nonpolar (ALA, Figure 3) and a polar (THR, Figure 4)

74

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

amino-acid. It is obvious that the BB RIE cumulative distributions are the only
distributions to have their shape affected by the secondary-structure content and the
particular AA RIE distributions show more than one peak. The distinctive peaks might be
assigned to special structural features and their identification remains a task for future
studies.

Fig. 2. The average RIE distributions of all ten types: a comparison of the secondarystructure classes. The colors of the lines correspond to the following structure sets: red –
CATH , blue – SCOP , green – CATH , magenta – SCOP . The detail of the BB
distribution in the bottom left corner is a zoom of the BB RIE distributions.
The fact that the CYS average NPNP RIE distribution is the only exception to the rule,
because it has two peaks, can be explained by a different strength of the noncovalent
interactions of the cystein SH group and cystine SS bridge.
The BB RIEs of particular AAs sampled through all of the structure sets are shown in Figure
5. There are remarkable differences between the shapes of the distributions corresponding to
the  and  proteins as well as between the shapes of the distributions for particular AAs.
Generally, the BB RIE distributions of the beta-structured proteins are shifted to a less
attractive (less negative) noncovalent region.

2.3 Size dependence
The proteins were selected based on their chain lengths up to fourteen groups regardless of
their secondary-structure content. Their characteristics (chain-length range, average chain
length, amino-acid type composition, number of proteins, number of residues of particular
types, average surface area) are reviewed in Table 1.

Table 1. The characteristics of the structure sets used for the RIE-size dependence studies.

77

RIEs of a particular type were sampled from all of the proteins of a particular size group.
The RIE averages were calculated separately for each interaction type of each size. The plots
of the average RIEs against size are presented in four figures (Figures 6 to 9) in order to
maintain the lucidity of the plots with lower magnitudes of average RIEs. The results
reported in Figure 6 suggest that the RIE-size dependence varies significantly with the
interaction type. On the one hand, the interaction of the polar residues with the backbone is
almost independent of size. On the other hand, the interactions of the side-chains follow
common rules, which are investigated later.
An interesting notion comes from a comparison of the magnitudes of the POPO and BBPO
average RIEs. The lower RIE magnitudes in the case of POPO RIEs are probably caused by
the lower probability of hydrogen-bond formation with polar side-chains in comparison
with the backbone-polar side-chain because of the lower frequency of their occurrence.
A noticeable trend is the coupling of BBCH and CHPO interactions (see Figure 8). This
binding may be ascribed to the same physical quality of these two types of interactions; they
both represent charge–dipole interactions. The accuracy of the data can be estimated from
the curve smoothness and is apparently lower in the case of charged residues. One possible
reason for this trend is that the RIEs of charged residues are the products of a large
compensation for the low amount of data.

2.3.1 The model of size dependence for the interaction of nonpolar amino-acid sidechains
Two simple models were tested to explain the observed trends. In the first model, protein is
assumed to be a sphere with nonpolar residues in its hydrophobic core and polar and
charged residues forming its exterior shell. The size dependence of a NPNP RIE average is
ascribed to the size dependence of the ratio between the core and surface residues. At
infinite length, the NPNP RIE should reach its limit. The second model is more realistic in
such a way that the core never behaves like a limitlessly increasing sphere and the volume
occupied by the side-chains must reach its limit. This limits the NPNP RIE value which will
not rise further with the increasing size of a protein and define a certain size of the most
compact amino-acid arrangement.
2.3.1.1 The NPNP RIE Model 1
An average NP residue can be described by its characteristic length r, surface factor fs
(corresponding to its surface or interaction area Sr = fsr2), volume factor fv (corresponding to its
volume Vr = fvr3) and the NPNP RIE limit for the infinite bulk E∞. As we are assuming that all
of the nonpolar residues form the core which has a spherical shape, the core size is determined
by the size of the protein and the ratio φ of nonpolar residues and all residues. A protein can

Decomposition of Intramolecular Interactions Between Amino-Acids in Globular
Proteins - A Consequence for Structural Classes of Proteins and Methods of Their Classification

79

be described by its porosity  (determining the ratio of the gap volume to the volume of the
whole protein) and at least its length N. Assuming that all of these quantities except for N are
constants, the volume of each protein can be expressed as Vp = NVr/(1- ) = Nfvr3/(1-) and the
core volume as Vc = Vpφ = Nφfvr3/(1-). The interaction surface of the core residues can be
considered as Si = NφSr and the core surface is Sc = 4πrc2. E can be calculated as

where ND is the domain size and ED = E∞ (1-kND-1/3) is NPNP RIE average at ND. The
parameters ND, k and E1 were fitted to the NPNP RIE averages. The agreement of the fitted
curve with the data is satisfactory considering the simplicity of the model as one can see in
Figure 11.
The coefficient k obtained by fitting the data is comparable to that obtained by a calculation
using the estimated values of fv, fs, and the experimental value of φ. Other types of
interactions seem to be unrelated to the domain size of a protein as there is no mechanism
connected with size that we could follow.

2.3.2 The reliability of the evaluated distributions
To adjust the reliability of our findings from computational point of view, we divided all of the
proteins randomly into two groups. The distributions are indistinguishable, which proves that
the distributions can be obtained by averaging even smaller sets of proteins. Additionally, we
calculated the distributions using the OPLS force field in a C representation of the protein
side-chains. Apparently (see Figure 12), the distributions for both FFs are the same. This not
only proves that our results are robust against a FF parametrization error but also suggests
that both FFs are within their limits equally good for RIE-distribution investigations.

Fig. 12. A Comparison of the distributions obtained by averaging the distributions within
the whole set using the OPLS Ca FF (dots) and Amber 03 Ca (full line) shows the robustness
of the distributions against the FF used. The distributions obtained by averaging the
distributions in two randomly chosen half-sets of structures calculated using the Amber Ca
FF are indistinguishable, which proves that our set is sufficiently large.

3. Conclusion
RIE distributions in proteins, except for the BB RIE distributions, are not affected by
secondary-structure content. The same applies for the distributions sampled for each amino-

acid separately. Hence, we can claim that the strength and selectivity of the SC-SC and SCBB interaction do not correlate with the secondary-structure content.
The size dependence of the RIEs can be satisfactorily described by the second model
proposed. Its three parameters can be fitted to the results obtained by FF calculations of a
high number of protein structures. One of the parameters obtained by fitting to the NPNP
RIE averages represents the optimum definition of the domain size in globular proteins.
Although the models proposed apply for all types of NP and PO SC-SC interactions, the
models fail in the description of the BB and CH interactions. Many interesting facts about
the size dependence of the RIE averages were revealed. First, the BBCH and CHPO
interactions seem to be bound by some as-yet unknown rule. Second, the PO interactions
exhibit “strange” behavior at a protein chain length of approximately seventy residues.
These findings need to be investigated more deeply.

1. Introduction
Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are essential to cellular processes. Recent developments of
high-throughput technologies have uncovered vast numbers of PPIs. However, the
experimental evidences are mostly for intra-species interactions of model organisms, especially
human. Studies of non-human organisms and inter-species PPIs are few. For organisms such
as Arabidopsis thaliana, the experimentally detected 5990 PPIs are estimated to be less than 3%
of the entire A. thaliana interactome (M. Lin et al., 2011). The accuracy of high-throughput PPI
experiments is also doubtful (Mrowka et al., 2001; Sprinzak et al., 2003; von Mering et al., 2002).
To resolve the above issues, several computational methods have been developed to
evaluate and predict PPIs. This chapter focuses on direct PPIs which involve physical
interactions of proteins, provides a brief overview of the reliabilities of high-throughput PPI
detection technologies, and discusses the weakness and strength of important PPI
computational prediction and evaluation methods. The major repositories which store,
evaluate, and analyse both detected and predicted PPIs are also introduced.

2. Experimental detection of protein interactions
Not until the past decade, PPIs were identified by time consuming and labour intensive
methods, such as low-throughput (small-scale) yeast 2-hybrid (Y2H). The development of
high-throughput technologies brought studies of PPIs to an -omics level. Of all the
technologies used for PPI detection, the high-throughput Y2H is most mature and
commonly used. However, it is also one of the most inaccurate techniques, producing an
estimated ~ 50% of false positives (Parrish et al., 2006; von Mering et al., 2002). The error
rates of the other high- and medium-throughput technologies are summarized in Table 1
(Mrowka et al., 2001; Parrish et al., 2006; Sprinzak et al., 2003; von Mering et al., 2002).
In the past few years, BiFC has became one of the popular in vivo technologies as it has a
medium throughput and reasonable cost, is technically straightforward, and provides

84

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

information on subcellular localizations of proteins. The drawback for BiFC is its occasional
false postivies caused by non-specific interactions and background flurorescence. Splitluciferase system has an extremely low background, but does not disclose the subcellular
localization of interactions. Protoplast Y2H is similar to Y2H, but technically more challenging
as it has to be operated in a nuclei or protoplasts. SUS has high rates of false positives and
background signals. The in vitro technologies are less favourable as the reactions do not occur
in cellular environments and do not examine the cellular localization of proteins.

Table 2. Computational methods for protein interaction prediction and evaluation
Methods for PPI prediction and evaluation is each developed based on an assumption
which states certain criteria are more likely to occur between interacting proteins. These
methods are often combined, usually in a Bayesian network (Huttenhower & Troyanskaya,
2006; Jansen et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2006; N. Lin et al., 2004; McDowall et al., 2009; Patil &
Nakamura, 2005; Wang et al., 2009; Xu et al., 2011). Some criteria are more relevant to
protein interactions than the others. When different methods are combined, the statistical
confidence estimated by each method could be weighted according to the confidence level
of corresponding assumption.
3.1 Interologs
Homologous proteins often conserve similar functions and PPIs across different organisms,
especially in phylogenetically close-related species (Hirsh & Sharan, 2007). These conserved
PPIs are designated as interologs.

86

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

In the interolog method, it is assumed that if a pair of proteins, A and B, interact and there
are two other proteins, A’ and B’, of which A’ is homologous to A and B’ is homologous to
B, then A’ and B’ are potentially an interolog to A and B. Interologs can occur among
different species or in the same species (Mika & Rost, 2006). The conventional interolog
method identifies homologous proteins by comparing the global sequences. For proteins of
which only partial sequences are similar, sequence signatures may be compared instead of
full sequences (Sprinzak & Margalit, 2001). Structurally similar proteins may also have
similar protein interactions, but predicting PPIs by identifying proteins with similar
structures is impeded by the limited structural information available (Aytuna et al., 2005;
Ogmen et al., 2005). The interologous relationship between the two pairs of proteins, one
pair predicted and one pair detected, could be evaluated by functions such as the s score.
(He et al., 2008). Homologous genes of model organisms can be identified using BLAST or in
HomoloGene database that automatically identifies and collects homologs from fully
sequenced genomes (Sayers et al., 2011).
The interolog method has been used frequently. The first human PPI network, the
Arabidopsis PPI network, and the rice blast fungus PPI network are a few examples
constructed by predicted interologs (Geisler-Lee et al., 2007; He et al., 2008; Lehner & Fraser,
2004). Unfortunately, prediction of plant PPIs through a comparative interactome approach
is challenged by the unique biology of plants which involves PPIs not commonly found in
the other model organisms. Less than 50% of A. thaliana proteins have been found to have
orthologs in the more extensively studied organisms such as yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans,
fruit fly, or human (Gollery et al., 2006). Furthermore, the interolog method does not
differentiate the functionally significant amino acid residues from the others; neglects the
residue-specific requirements for interaction specificity and affinity (Uhrig & Hulskamp,
2006). For the highly homologous members of protein families, the interlog method could be
prone to errors.
3.2 Phylogenetic relationship
Interacting proteins have been observed to have topologically similar phylogenetic trees for
the corresponding protein families, presumably due to the co-evolution of cooperating
proteins (Fryxell, 1996; Goh et al., 2000; Pages et al., 1997). Based on the above observation,
the phylogenetic similarity method was proposed. To compare and construct the
phylogenetic trees, firstly, the sequences of two potentially interacting protein families are
aligned. Secondly, the evolutionary distance matrixes are calculated from the phylogenetic
trees, one for each protein family. Finally, the Pearson’s correlation coefficient between the
two distance matrixes is calculated as an indication of the likelihood of interactions. Partial
protein sequences could be used to construct the phylogenetic trees - for example, poorly
conserved sequences have been removed to improve the performance of prediction (Kann et
al., 2007).
A similar approach is the phylogenetic profile method. Phylogenetic profile is the profile
which records the presence and absence of a protein across all species. Also due to the
presumably co-evolution of proteins involved in the same biological process, proteins with
similar phylogenetic profiles are more likely to have interactions. The profiles could be
compared by Hamming distance (Pellegrini et al., 1999). Although this approach is
powerful, it can be applied only to organisms which have been fully sequenced (Frishman,
2009). Additionally, there might be complications with essential proteins which are present

The Prediction and Analysis of Inter- and Intra-Species Protein-Protein Interaction

87

in all organisms (Frishman, 2009). As the second generation sequencing (SGS) technologies
exponentially accumulating full genome sequences of non-model organisms, this method is
expected to become more favorable.
3.3 Gene fusion and neighboring
Genes which are previously separated in the genome of one organism can be fused into the
same gene in another organism. Fused genes almost always encode functional related and
physically interacting proteins (Enright et al., 1999; Marcotte et al., 1999). The fusion events
might accelerate the formation of protein complexes by increasing the opportunity of correct
physical contact between interacting sites.
Similarly, in bacteria, genes which are consistently located in the same operon across many
species are likely to express functionally related, and often physically interacting, proteins
(Dandekar et al., 1998; Overbeek et al., 1999; Tamames et al., 1997).
3.4 Domain-domain interactions
Just like protein interactions, domain interactions can be predicted by sequence homology
among two pairs of interacting domains, by investigating the evolutionary traits of domains,
or by identifying conserved neighboring relationship between domains (Frishman, 2009).
Interacting proteins are also more likely to contain domains which have been detected or
predicted to interact (Ng et al., 2003).
3.5 Co-expression
Interacting proteins are assumed to have similar expression patterns (Dyer et al., 2007).
The co-expression correlation coefficients of seven model animals, including human,
mouse, chicken, zebra fish, fruit fly, and Coenorhabditis elegans, and nematode, are
recorded in COXPRESdb (Obayashi et al., 2008; Obayashi & Kinoshita, 2011). The coexpression correlation coefficients of A. thaliana and many other flowering plants are
recorded in ATTED-II (Obayashi et al., 2011). High-throughput expression data are mostly
available on Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) or TAIR for A. thaliana experiments
(Garcia-Hernandez et al., 2002; Sayers et al., 2011).
3.6 Gene Ontology (GO)
Interacting proteins are presumably to participate in related biological process and share
similar cellular localization (Dyer et al., 2007; Shin et al., 2009). The GO project annotates
the cellular components where a protein locates and the biological process in which a
protein participates. The annotations are created by structured and controlled
vocabularies. The semantic similarities between GO terms assigned to proteins are often
used to evaluate the confidence levels of proposed PPIs (De Bodt et al., 2009; Jain & Bader,
2010).
3.7 Topology
As more and more PPIs are revealed, PPI networks can be constructed and analyzed by
topology theories. It has been proposed that two proteins which interact with the same
protein should have a shorter path between them on the PPI network (Dyer et al., 2007). It
has also been proposed that interacting proteins might share more neighboring proteins on
a PPI network (J. Chen et al., 2006; Chua et al., 2006).

88

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

3.8 Text mining
The protein interactions which have been reported repeatedly in more peer-reviewed
literatures might be more trustworthy than the ones which have never or rarely been
detected (Jaeger et al., 2008). However, it must be noted that proteins with more valuable
functions, such as disease mechanisms, would have been studied more intensively and been
documented more frequently.
PubMed and GeneRIF are common sources of text mining materials. The automated data
gathering (e.g. text mining via natural language processing or biomedical language
processing) is not as reliable as manually curated data. It must be noted that manual
curation is neither 100% correct due to human errors and inconsistent standards for
curation.
3.9 Experimental detections
PPIs detected by low-throughput technologies are generally considered as error free. For the
medium- to high-throughput technologies, the reliability of the results varied as listed in
Table 1. In vivo experiments are usually more accurate than the in vitro experiments, as in
vivo experiments were conducted in cellular environments. Interactions supported by more
than one method are generally believed to be more reliable (von Mering et al., 2002). PPI
datasets which are more reliable are assumed to have more intersections with the other
datasets and higher averaged numbers of documented protein interactions (Shin et al.,
2009). Reliable PPI datasets should also contain greater proportion of interactions which
have interacting domain pairs (He et al., 2008).
In silica protein docking is another approach which could be used for predicting protein
interactions; however, it is impractical for high-throughput predictions due to the extremely
large amount of required computation and the lack of detected or predicted structures for
most proteins.

4. Protein interaction databases
More than 30 PPI databases have been published and are mostly available online (Fischer et al.,
2005). Table 3 listed the frequently referenced databases. The contents of these databases are
often overlapped and integrated to create larger non-redundant databases. These collections of
PPIs can be used as the foundation for predicting and evaluating the reliability of PPIs.

Table 3. Major PPI databases
MINT is one of the few repositories which provide confidence scores for experimentally
detected PPIs. It uses the number and types of experiments in which a PPI is detected to
estimate the confidence of data.

90

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

HiPredict is a repository which contains filtered high-confidence PPIs of nine model species
from IntAct, BioGRID, and HPRD. While calculating the confidence of PPIs, HiPredict
considers (1) the type of experiments which detect the PPIs, (2) the co-expression correlation
coefficients of proteins, (3) shared GO terms of proteins, (4) presences of interologs in the
same organisms, and (5) domain-domain interactions between proteins. These five criteria
are combined in naïve Bayesian networks to give confidence scores.
STRING is one of the largest and most comprehensive PPI repositories. It evaluates PPIs
using multiple criteria, including (1) the probability of finding the interacting proteins on
the same KEGG pathway, (2) co-mentioning of gene/protein names in PubMed abstracts, (3)
co-expression / co-regulation of proteins, (4) presence of interologs, and (5) presence of gene
neighboring. Similar to HiPredict, the various criteria are also combined in naïve Bayesian
networks.
HAPPI only collects human PPIs. For the PPIs which have been evaluated, such as data
from STRING, the confidence scores are preserved. For the PPIs which have not evaluated,
HAPPI calculates the confidence scores based on the type of experimental evidences and the
source of data.
PAIR collects 5990 detected protein interactions and 145494 predicted interaction of A.
thaliana (M. Lin et al., 2011). These PPIs were expected to cover 24% of the entire A. thaliana
interactome, of which the size was estimated to be 200 000 PPIs (for 20 000 genes) based the
size for yeast (18 000 PPIs for 6000 genes). An estimated 44% of the collected PPIs in PAIR
are reliable. PAIR predicts PPIs using a machine learning approach with supports the vector
machine (SVM) model. In the SVM model, indirect evidences of interactions (i.e. interologs,
phylogenetic profile similarity, domain interactions, gene co-expression correlation, shared
GO terms, and protein localizations) are combined. The model has been trained using Gold
Standard Positives (GSPs), which are reliable PPIs from major repositories. The SVM scores
also serve as the confidence scores for the predicted PPIs. The detected PPIs are collected
from IntAct, BioGRID, and BIND.
AtPIN integrates (1) the predicted PPIs from Geisler-Lee and AtPID, (2) the curated PPIs from
TAIR, and (3) the detected PPIs from BioGRID and IntAct (Brandao et al., 2009). Geisler-Lee
(2007) predicts PPIs by identifying interologs. AtPIN calculates confidence scores of PPIs based
on (1) the detected or predicted co-localization of interacting proteins and (2) the number of
shared neighboring proteins of interacting proteins on the PPI network. It also provides the
score calculated by AtPID. AtPID combines indirect evidences of interactions, including
interologs, phylogenetic profiles, domain interactions, co-expression profile, shared protein
functions, protein co-localisation, and gene fusion, in naïve Bayesian networks to predict and
evaluate the PPIs of A. thaliana (Cui et al., 2008; Li et al., 2011). TAIR is a multi-tasking project
which participates in a broad range of A. thaliana researches.
The data of protein interactions between hosts and pathogens are scarce. PIG integrates the
manually curated human-pathogen PPIs from four databases, BIND, IntAct, REACTOME,
and MINT, in one platform for searching, visualization, and analysis of PPI networks. The
corresponding hyperlinks to UniProt database, Gene Ontology, InterProScan, and PubMed
are filed under each protein entry in the user interface for convenient referencing.
Similar to PIG, HPIDB integrates several host-pathogen PPI databases, including BIND,
IntAct, REACTOME, MINT, GENERIF, and PIG. However, unlike PIG, the PPIs in HPIDB
are not limited to human host. Although the majority of data is for human (22386 PPIs),
HPIDB also contains host-pathogen PPIs for mouse (147 PPIs), A. thaliana (99 PPIs), rat (53
PPIs), cattle (30 PPIs), and chicken (19 PPIs).

A few repositories collect genes which are involved in host-pathogen interactions, but do
not contain data on physical protein interactions. PHIDIAS is a centralized respiratory for
host-pathogen interactions. It collects information for 98 pathogens of two hosts, human,
and mouse (Xiang et al., 2007). PHI-Base contains information for 405 fungal, oomycete, and
bacterial genes which participate in pathogenicity, virulence, and induction of disease
resistance (Baldwin et al., 2006; Winnenburg et al., 2006). 176 of these genes are from animal
pathogens, 227 from plant pathogens, and 3 from pathogens of fungi. PathoPlant contains
A. thaliana genes which are responsible in the defense against pathogens (Bulow et al., 2007).

5. Identification of drug targets within human-pathogen interactions network
The evolutionary history of human has never been parted with pathogens. Viruses, bacteria,
fungi, and nematodes all play critical roles in shaping the human race. Recent advances in
metagenomics and human microbiomes suggest that commensal microorganisms have
significant influences to the metabolism, immune systems, general wellbeing, and even
behaviour patterns of animal hosts.
Despite enormous efforts in preventing, diagnosing, and treating infectious diseases,
pathogens still cause insurmountable burden and social-economical impacts to human. The
developments of vaccines and drugs have helped to diminish several devastating diseases;
however, emerging diseases caused by novel or previously unknown pathogens
continuously lead to unexpected outbreaks. To account for current and future threats
imposed by pathogens, it is necessary to understand human-pathogen interactions at the
molecular level. Viruses require host factors for recognition, entrance, replication, and
release. Their gene products form dense interaction networks with host proteins. Most
bacteria, fungi, and nematodes, on the other hand, proliferate outside of human cells and
interact with host cells with extracellular signals and receptors. The following sections of
this chapter review previous works on high-throughput characterization of humanpathogen interactions interactions, mostly between human and viruses. Most works have
focused on human-virus interactions.
5.1 Human-virus interactions
High-throughput characterization of intra-species interactions has been the focus of early
day PPI studies. Inter-species interactions still constitute a minor part of most interactome
databases. Beginning from 2007, several works on high-throughput human-virus
interactions and host factor characterization have been published, including the ones for
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and influenza virus. Among these sparse
inter-species interactions, those between human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) and
human are most abundant due to the research efforts devoted to this notorious virus. These
datasets are summarized in Table 4.
Among these datasets, the HIV-1 human protein interaction database is so far the most
comprehensive in terms of recorded interaction number and annotations. The number of
human-virus PPIs can be estimated based on the number of human-HIV PPIs, which
presumably have not been fully exposed, and the number of human viruses. A severe
under-estimated number of human viruses is 200 ~ 1 000 species, which can be deduced to
at least 1 ~ 5 million human-virus PPIs yet to be discovered. Despite the small number of
human-virus PPIs being detected or predicted, this data is a start point to the research of the
viral disease mechanisms and treatments.

Table 4. Summary of human-virus interaction datasets
5.2 HIV-1 interactions
The HIV-1, Human Protein Interaction Database (Pinney et al., 2009) was compiled
by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and hosted by NCBI.
Interaction data in this database was collected from published literatures. Unlike other
interaction data, entries in this dataset were associated with detailed annotations,
including PubMed ID list for references, short phrases describing the interactions,
and texts excerpted from the source literature. Interactions in this database are not
just revealed by conventional Y2H or immune-co-precipitation, but 70 interactions
were annotated with details. For example, the statement “HIV retropepsin cleaves human
actin” is supported by four publications and attached with descriptions of
the HIV retropepsin and human actin. Occassionally, the texts from the source literatures
would provide additional information. In the case of “HIV retropepsin cleaves human
alpha-2-macroglobulin precursor”, the GeneRIF text states “the cleavage site of alpha
2-Macroglobulin by HIV-1 protease is the Phe684-Tyr685 bond”, which depicts
the interaction (cleavage) site. Interaction types include cleavage, binding,
regulation/modulation, and post-translational modifications.
Analysis of this database found that there were 21 HIV gene products interacting with 1433
human proteins. The top 10 HIV and human proteins which participate in most HIV-human
interactions are listed in Table 5.
By simply counting the numbers of PPIs in Table 5, critical host factors in HIV infections
could be identified. The C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) variants have been
implicated in HIV-resistance and immunity (Blanpain et al., 2002). Stem cell-based gene
therapy has successfully “cured” HIV with this genetic variant in early phase clinical trials
(Symonds et al., 2010). Some host factors were also involved in various types of processes
and diseases, such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF), which regulates cell proliferation,
apoptosis, and has been implicated in cancer.

Table 5. HIV and human proteins participate in largest numbers of human-HIV interactions.
Table 5 also suggests that Tat could be a potential drug target. The crystal structure of Tat
which forms complex with cyclin-denpendent protein kinase 9 (CDK9) and cyclin T1 has
been solved (Tahirov et al., 2010). The complex structure (PDB ID: 3MI9) reveals that the
most part of Tat has physical contact with cyclin T1 and has only a small loop contacting
CDK9. The structural information provides valuable insights to the design of Tat inhibitors.
5.3 Epstein-Barr virus interactions
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects human epithelial cells, and is implicated in various types of
cancer, such as Burkitt’s lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The interactions within
EBV proteins, and between EBV and human proteins, have been characterized using Y2H
method (Calderwood et al., 2007). Overall, 43 EBV-EBV and 173 human-EBV interactions
have been validated with experimental evidences.
Network analysis reveals that most EBV-EBV interactions take place among conserved
“core” proteins, thus these interactions may be responsible for the general
infection/replication of herpesviruses. On the other hand, most human proteins targeted by
EBV are proposed as “hub” proteins, which participate in more human-human interactions
and may have crucial roles in the underlying biological processes. The EBV protein targeting
most human proteins is BFLF2, with 21 interaction partners. BFLF2 interacts with BFRF1
and changes cellular localization (Gonnella et al., 2005). Deletion of BFLF2 also impairs viral
DNA packaging (Granato et al., 2008). The most targeted human proteins are HOMER3 and
GRN. HOMER3, which binds to numerous receptors, is involved in diverse biological
functions such as neuronal signalling and T-cell activation. Granulin (GRN) is a secreted
glycosylated peptide which regulates cell growth and implicates in wound healing and
tumorigenesis. BFLF2 interacts with both HOMER3 and GRN; however, the functional
implications of interactions were not clear.
5.4 Hepatitis C virus interactions
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the pathogen which causes the chronic hepatitis infection.
Infection with HCV may lead to cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma if not properly treated with

94

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

antiviral drugs or interferon. Unfortunately, current HCV treatments are expensive and can
have severe adverse effects. The human-HCV interaction map would allow us to
understand the mechanisms of HCV infection and its chronic nature.
The human-HCV interaction network is constituted by 481 HCV-human interactions (de
Chassey et al., 2008). Among these interactions, 314 were determined with Y2H
experiments, and others were identified from literature reviews. The most connected HCV
proteins include NS3, NS5A, and CORE. Human proteins targeted by most HCV proteins
include nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 1 (NR4A1), homeobox D8 (HOXD8),
and SET domain containing 2 (SETD2). NR4A1 is a nuclear transcription factor, which is
highly expressed in adrenal cortex, lung, and prostate; however its expression level in liver
is low. HOXD8 is important to development; its deletion leads to limb deformation.
Expression level of HOXD8 is highest in kidney. SETD2 is a histone methyltransferase and
also contains transcription activation domain. Recently, SETD2 has been found as a tumour
suppressor gene (Duns et al., 2010). However, the roles of HCV-SETD2 interactions in
tumorigenesis remain elusive.
The analyses of EBV-human and HCV-human interaction networks found that viral proteins
tend to interact with “hubs” in human protein-protein interaction networks. In human
proteins targeted by HCV, three KEGG pathways were significantly enriched, including
insulin signalling pathway, TGF signalling pathway, and Jak-STAT signalling pathway (de
Chassey et al., 2008). Also, “focal adhesion” pathway has been identified as a novel pathway
targeted by HCV. In our own analysis using bootstrap to estimate the statistical significance
of HCV targeted gene numbers, we have also identified that “focal adhesion” and “ECMreceptor interaction” pathways may be perturbed by HCV infection (Table 6).

5.5 Influenza virus host factors
Influenza A virus causes epidemics every now and then. The high transmission rate of
influenza virus makes it one of the greatest threats to public health, especially when long
diminished strains or emerging strains turned to the surface. The rapidly evolving virus
makes it difficult to predict and prepare seasonal vaccines. Drug-resistant strains also
challenge our ability to treat and control the disease.
The identification of host factors required by influenza virus may contribute to the
prevention and treatment of the virus. Host factors involved in early stage influenza virus
replication have been characterized with genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screening
(Konig et al., 2010). Unlike Y2H experiments, host factors identified with RNAi do not
necessary interact with viral proteins directly. Nevertheless, these findings imply that viral
diseases may be treated by regulating some of these host factors. One example is the
inhibitor for the host factors, CAMK2B, which impedes viral growth and may be developed
to new antiviral drugs.
5.6 Human-bacteria interactions
Bacteria cells can reproduce without the cellular machinery of hosts. Studies on humanbacteria interactions thus have been focused on cellular-level interactions. So far,
only limited efforts have been devoted to the identification of human-bacteria interactions
at the molecular-level. The interactions between three pathogenic bacteria, Bacillus
anthracis, Francisella tularensis, and Yersinia pestis, have been characterized using highthroughput Y2H experiments (Dyer et al., 2010). The reported dataset includes 3,073,
1,383, and 4,059 interactions between human or B. anthracis, F. tularensis or Y. pestis,
respectively.
The topology of these human-bacteria and human protein-protein interaction networks
revealed that many bacteria proteins target “hubs” in human PPI networks. Specifically,
several host defence pathways have been identified, including innate immunity and
inflammation. Comparative analysis of the three human-pathogen interaction networks also
confirmed these findings. Several methods have been used to identify the conserved protein
interaction modules (CPIM), and found that these bacteria may have interfered host innate
immune responses, including antigen binding and processing, and several immune
response pathways.
Analysis of these interactions faces some obstacles. Large proportions of the bacteria
proteins (285/943, 66/349, 630/1,218 protiens for B. anthracis, F. tularensis, and Y. pestis,
respectively) which interact with human proteins are putative, hypothetical, or
uncharacterized. Without sufficient functional annotations, interpretations of these
interactions can be superficial. Furthermore, bacterial proteins and human proteins were
confined within the membrane of respective cells, and only certain types of proteins can be
exported or internalized by host cells. Thus, the annotations or predictions of protein
subcellular localization are important tasks for the interpretation and refinements of humanbacteria interaction networks.
5.7 Systematic analysis of host-pathogen interactions
Human-pathogen interactions have been collected and analyzed for their network
properties (Dyer et al., 2008). Pooling together human-pathogen interactions should enable
identification of common targets and biological processes perturbed by pathogens. A total of

96

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

10477 interactions between human and the 190 pathogen strains have been collected from
several public databases. Networks for human-bacteria and human-virus interactions have
been constructed separately. Most of the interactions were human-virus interactions,
notably human-HIV interactions.
Special attention has been paid to human proteins which interact with multiple pathogen
groups. Such proteins are believed to be the common targets of these pathogens, and may be
the highlights of critical events during pathogen invasion.
The analysis of human proteins targeted by multiple viral pathogens have revealed that
viruses perturb host cells mainly through controlling cell cycle, regulating apoptosis, and
transporting viral particles across membrane (Dyer et al., 2008). Human-bacteria
interactions, on the other hand, perturb Gene Ontology processes like “immune system
process” and “immune response”. It is notable that much of these perturbed pathways were
linked to inflammatory and cancer, suggesting multiple roles of pathogens in various
diseases.
Another analysis on human-viral interaction network also highlighted the mechanisms of
non-infectious diseases (Navratil et al., 2011). Totally 2,099 manually curated interactions of
416 viral proteins from 110 species have been collected. This human-virus interaction
network has been integrated with human PPI network. Disease gene annotations from
OMIM have been evaluated for their associations with viral proteins. Links between virus
and auto-immune diseases have been found, including type 1 diabetes. A comparison
between human-virus interaction network and human type I interferon network also
revealed that viruses attack host at multiple levels, from receptors to transcription factors
(Navratil et al., 2010).
We have also performed similar analysis with human-virus interactions collected from
NCBI interactions2, IntAct (Aranda et al., 2009), and other sources. The association of KEGG
(Kanehisa et al., 2010) disease pathways and human-virus interactions have been analyzed.
Several KEGG pathways have been identified with high significance, including “systemic
lupus erythematosus”, “pathways in cancer”, “chemokine signalling pathway”, “focal
adhesion”, and “T cell receptor signalling pathway”. These findings are in par with studies
described in previous sections; all pointing to pathogens gain their foothold in host cells
through modulating host defence mechanisms. In the meantime, inflammation,
autoimmune diseases and cancers may arise as results of these modulations.

6. Conclusion
At the present, the number of confident PPI data is scarce, especially for non-human
organisms and inter-species interactions. The prediction of PPIs, as well as the evaluation of
accuracy of detected and predicted PPIs, are important topics which require further
advances in methodology, tools and data generation. It is believed that, in recent years, as
the second generation sequencing (SGS) rapidly discloses full genome sequences and
exponentially accumulates high-throughput expression data, more and more inter- and
intra-species networks PPI will be constructed for, not only model organisms, but also crops,
biofuel producing algae and bacteria, between host-pathogens, and between symbiotic
organisms.

1. Introduction
The last several decades have witnessed rapid progresses in identification and functional
analysis of post-translational modifications (PTMs) in proteins. Through temporal and spatial
modification of proteins by covalent attachment of additional chemical groups and other small
proteins, proteolytic cleavage or intein splicing, PTMs greatly expand the proteome diversity
and play important roles in regulating the stability and functions of the proteins (Mann and
Jensen, 2003; Walsh, 2005; Walsh and Jefferis, 2006). To date, more than 350 types of distinct
PTMs were experimentally discovered in vivo, while subsequently functional assays have
detected a number of exciting observations. In 1992, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine
was awarded to Edmond H. Fischer and Edwin G. Krebs for their seminal discovery that
reversible protein phosphorylation is a biological regulatory mechanism (Kresge et al., 2011),
while Leland H. Hartwell, Tim Hunt, and Paul M. Nurse shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology
or Medicine 2001 for their profound contributions in identification of key regulators including
cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and cyclins that precisely orchestrate the cell cycle process
through phosphorylation (Balter and Vogel, 2001). Moreover, Aaron Ciechanover, Avram
Hershko and Irwin Rose became laureates of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2004 for their
discovery of ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation (Vogel, 2004).
Although virtually all PTMs play their major roles as regulating the biological processes,
different ones have their aspects with emphasis. For example, phosphorylation is
preferentially implicated in signal-transduction cascades, while ubiquitination regulates the
lifetime of proteins by targeting specific substrates for degradation. Recently, protein lysine
acetylation was observed to play a predominant role in regulation of cellular metabolism
(Wang et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2010). Other types of PTMs such as sumoylation,
glycosylation and palmitoylation are also critical for exactly orchestrating distinct cellular
processes (Fukata and Fukata, 2010; Linder and Deschenes, 2007). Furthermore, the crosstalk
among different PTMs is ubiquitous, especially on histones, which is regarded as the
“histone code” (Jenuwein and Allis, 2001). The aberrances of PTMs are highly associated in
diseases and cancers, while a variety of regulatory enzymes involved in PTMs have been
drug targets (Lahiry et al., 2010; Norvell and McMahon, 2010). In this regard, elucidation of
PTMs regulatory roles is fundamental for understanding molecular mechanisms of diseases
and cancers, and further biomedical design.

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

Recently, with the developments of “state-of-the-art” techniques especially the highthroughput mass spectrometry (HTP-MS), large-scale identification of PTMs substrates with
their sites has become a popular and near-routine assay (Choudhary and Mann, 2010). For
example, combined with efficient isolation and enrichment methods such as antibodies which
specifically recognize modified peptides and subsequently HTP-MS profiling, thousands of
PTMs sites, eg., phosphorylation (Olsen et al., 2006; Villen et al., 2007), acetylation (Choudhary
et al., 2009), or glycosylation (Zielinska et al., 2010) sites can be accurately determined in a
single experiment. These high-throughout approaches can provide systematic insights into the
biological roles of PTMs, especially a global view. However, due to the technical limitations
such as low-sensitive detection of modifications in low expressed proteins (Ackermann and
Berna, 2007; Boschetti and Righetti, 2009; Yates et al., 2009), and error-prone determination of
multiple modified proteins (Hunter, 2007; Young et al., 2010), it is still a great challenge for
fully charactering the whole PTM events in vivo.
In contrast with conventional experimental methods, computational analysis of PTMs has
also been an alternative and attractive approach for its accuracy, fast-speed and
convenience. The computational predictors can narrow down the number of potentially
candidates and rapidly generate useful information for further experimental investigations.
In one of our recent reviews, we specifically summarized more than 50 computational
resources including public databases and prediction tools for phosphorylation (Xue et al.,
2010a). Currently, although there have been ~170 databases and computational tools
developed for PTM analysis (http://www.biocuckoo.org/link.php), accurate prediction of
PTM sites in given proteins is still not a simple job. Again, although protein 3D structure
information can be helpful for prediction of PTMs sites (Kumar and Mohanty, 2010),
mainstream computational approaches were designed mainly based on protein primary
sequence features (Xue et al., 2010a). A variety of algorithms have been introduced into this
field, such as position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) (Obenauer et al., 2003), support vector
machines (SVMs) (Kim et al., 2004), artificial neural network (ANN) (Blom et al., 2004),
Hidden Markov Model (HMM) (Huang et al., 2005), Bayesian decision theory (Xue et al.,
2006a), and Conditional Random Field (CRF) (Dang et al., 2008). These methods were
largely introduced from the fields of informatics or statistics and originally designed for
general propose.
Previously, we developed a series of GPS algorithms (Initially defined as Group-based
Phosphorylation Scoring and later renamed as Group-based Prediction System), which have
been exclusively and successfully used for the prediction of kinds of PTM sites, such as
phosphorylation (Xue et al., 2005; Xue et al., 2008; Xue et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2004),
sumoylation (Ren et al., 2009; Xue et al., 2006b), palmitoylation (Ren et al., 2008; Zhou et al.,
2006a), S-Nitrosylation (Xue et al., 2010b) and nitration (Liu et al., 2011). The prediction
performance of GPS 1.x (1.0 and 1.1) could be comparative to other analogous approaches,
while GPS 2.x versions (2.0 and 2.1) are much better than other strategies (Xue et al., 2010a).
Recently, we greatly improved our previous method and released the GPS 3.0 algorithm,
while has been successfully adopted for predicting S-nitrosylation (Xue et al., 2010b) and
nitration sites (Liu et al., 2011), with further enhanced performances. During the past several
years, a considerable number of bioinformatists or experimentalists have communicated
with us on GPS algorithm details, which were never thoroughly described in our previously
research articles due to page limitation. In this regard, the aim of this chapter is to provide a
comprehensive description of GPS series algorithms. First, we gave a historical introduction
of GPS 1.x, GPS 2.x and the latest GPS 3.0 algorithms. Also, we used palmitoylation as an

of benchmark data preparation, scoring strategies, performance evaluation and comparison,
and software package implementation were clearly described. The online service and local
packages of CSS-Palm 3.0 are freely available at: http://csspalm.biocuckoo.org/. For

2. GPS series algorithms
In this section, we described the theoretical basis and developmental history of GPS series
algorithms. The chief hypothesis of the algorithm is established on consensus experimental
observations that if two short peptides share high sequence homology, they may exhibit
similar 3D structures and biochemical properties. This hypothesis is widely adopted by
conventional experimentalists, who usually compare a given protein to homologous
modified proteins by sequence alignment. If a conserved peptide is observed around
aligned modified residue, they may obtain confidence that the peptide in the given protein
can also be modified. We borrowed this hypothesis and implemented it into an automatic
algorithm. First, we used the amino acid substitution matrix BLOSUM62 to evaluate the
similarity between two phosphorylation site peptides PSP(m, n) with m residues upstream and
n residues downstream flanking the phosphorylated site, while m and n were arbitrarily
determined as 3 for phosphorylation site peptide (Xue et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2004). In GPS
(Group-based Phosphorylation Scoring) 1.0 and 1.1, we clustered the phosphorylated
peptides with Markov cluster algorithm (MCL for short) with an additional hypothesis of
that one protein kinase (PK) can recognize more than one motif in substrates (Xue et al.,
2005; Zhou et al., 2004). Later, based on the observation of different matrix generating
different performance, we developed the matrix mutation (MaM) approach for the
performance improvement in GPS 2.0, which was refined as Group-based Prediction System
(Xue et al., 2008). In GPS 2.0, the MCL clustering was discarded for its low efficiency while
the informative peptide was selected as PSP(7, 7) (Xue et al., 2008). For the prediction of
sumoylation (Ren et al., 2009) and palmitoylation sites (Ren et al., 2008), we testingly
classified modification sites based on known linear motifs together with GPS 2.0 algorithm,
and achieved increased performances. Later, we improved the algorithm to version 2.1 for
the prediction of phosphorylation sites with a additional motif length selection method
(MLS) (Xue et al., 2011). Recently, with two additional approaches of k-means clustering and

108

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

weight training (WT), we further designed GPS 3.0 algorithm for the prediction of Snitrosylation (Xue et al., 2010b) and nitration sites (Liu et al., 2011). The details of GPS series
algorithms were described below.
2.1 GPS 1.x algorithms
The GPS 1.x algorithms include two versions of GPS 1.0 and GPS 1.1. In 2004, we initially
designed the GPS 1.0 algorithm for the prediction of kinase-specific phosphorylation sites,
while the full name of GPS was “Group-based Phosphorylation Scoring” (Zhou et al., 2004).
From public databases and literature curation, we collected 2,001 experimentally identified
phosphorylation sites with their cognate PKs (Zhou et al., 2004). Since similar PKs can
modify similar sequences in the substrates, we clustered the available PKs into 52 PK groups
according to the BLAST results and Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL annotations. Then the known
phosphorylation sites were classified into one of multiple of the 52 PK groups based on their
regulatory PK information (Zhou et al., 2004). Based on the hypothesis of similar short
peptides bearing similar biological properties, we designed a simple scoring strategy. Given
a phosphorylation site peptide PSP(m, n) as a serine (S), threonine (T) or tyrosine (Y) amino acid
flanked by m residues upstream and n residues downstream, we employed the amino acid
substitution matrix BLOSUM62 to evaluate the similarity of peptides. In GPS 1.0 (Zhou et
al., 2004), the m and n were arbitrarily chosen as 3. For two PSP(m, n), we scored the
similarity of two PSP(m, n) as:

S( A, B) 



Score( A[ i], B[ i])

(1)

 m i  n

Score(A[i], B[i]) represents the substitution score of the two amino acid of A[i] and B[i] in
BLOSUM62. If S(A, B)<0, we simply redefined it as S(A, B)=0. With an additional hypothesis
that one PK can recognize multiple motifs, we automatically clustered the phosphorylation site
peptides into more than one groups with Markov cluster algorithm (MCL for short). Thus,
given any peptide for the prediction of kinase-specific phosphorylation sites, we calculated the
average score between the peptide and the experimentally identified phosphorylated site
peptides in each cluster, while the maximum score among the clusters was decided as the final
score. The prediction performance can be comparative with other tools such as Scansite
(Obenauer et al., 2003). Later, we slightly refined the algorithm and released GPS 1.1 version,
which can predict phosphorylation sites for 216 unique kinases in 71 kinase groups (Xue et al.,
2005). Again, the m and n in GPS 1.1 were still selected as 3. The only improvement in GPS 1.1
is that the classification of PKs is better than GPS 1.0 (Xue et al., 2005).
Furthermore, we applied the GPS 1.x algorithm to predict a variety of PTMs such as
sumoylation and palmitoylation, with additional refinement if necessary (Xue et al., 2006b;
Zhou et al., 2006a). For the prediction of sumoylation sites in SUMOsp 1.0 (Xue et al., 2006b),
both GPS 1.x and Motif-X algorithms (Schwartz and Gygi, 2005) were employed because a
large proportion of sumoylation sites follow a consensus motif ψ-K-X-E (ψ is a hydrophobic
amino acid) or ψ-K-X-E/D (Johnson, 2004). Thus, all known sumoylation sites were
classified into two groups with consensus and non-consensus. A given peptide will be
compared to known sumoylation sites of both two groups by calculating the average
similarity scores, respectively. The maximum score was decided as the final score. And if the
score is higher than a pre-determined threshold, the peptide will be predicted as potential
sumoylation site (Xue et al., 2006b). In SUMOsp 1.0, the sumoylation site peptide for the
prediction was arbitrarily selected as SSP(7, 7). For the prediction of palmitoylation sites in

Computational Prediction of Post-Translational Modification Sites in Proteins

109

CSS-Palm 1.0 (Zhou et al., 2006a), the palmitoylation site peptide was casually chosen as
PSP(7, 7). Because no common canonical consensus sequence/motif for palmitoylation was
reported, we developed a BLOSUM62-based Clustering method (BBC) based on the graph
theory, and classified all known palmitoylation sites into three clusters (Zhou et al., 2006a).
2.2 GPS 2.x algorithms
The GPS 1.x algorithms were too preliminary, while a variety of issues were not addressed.
By personal communications, several researchers asked us a number of questions. For
example, why we arbitrarily chose BLOSUM62 rather than other amino acid substitution
matrices? Why we classified the PKs based on BLAST searching rather than using preestablished classification information? Why we selected PSP(3, 3) or PSP(7, 7)? The aim of
GPS 2.x algorithms was to resolve these problems.
To evaluate the prediction performance and robustness of a predictor, we usually
preformed the self-consistency validation, the leave-one-out validation (LOO) and n-fold
cross-validations. The self-consistency validation used the training positive data (+) and
negative data (-) directly to evaluate the prediction performance, and represented the
computational power of the prediction system. However, the prediction system might be
overtrained and only perfect for the training data set, with low prediction ability for new
data. In this regard, the LOO validation and n-fold cross-validations should be performed to
evaluate the robustness and the stability on an independent data set. In the LOO validation,
each site in the data set was picked out in turn as an independent test sample, and all the
remaining sites were regarded as training data. This process was repeated until each site
was used as test data one time. In n-fold cross-validations, all the (+) sites and (-) sites were
combined and then divided equally into n parts, keeping the same distribution of (+) and (-)
sites in each part. Then n-1 parts were merged into a training data set while the remnant
part was taken as a testing data set. This process was repeated 20 times and the average
performance of n-fold cross-validations was used to estimate the performance. In our
previous study, when the training data set is large enough (number of positive sites ≥ 30),
the results of n-fold cross-validations are similar with the LOO result. In this regard, we
merely used the LOO validation to evaluate the robustness and stability.
In GPS 1.x algorithms, the amino acid substitution matrix was arbitrarily chosen as
BLOSUM62, while performances of other matrices were not evaluated. For the sake of better
performance, we tested other matrices such as BLOSUM30, 45, 62, 90 and PAM10, 90, 250,
500, and found different matrices could generate various performances (Xue et al., 2008). For
example, PAM10-based scoring can easily generate a perfect self-consistency result with
sensitivity (Sn) of 100% and specificity (Sp) of 100%, while the LOO result is very poor that
denotes the prediction model is highly over-fitting and unstable. In this regard, a key
challenge is that whether we can obtain an optimal or near-optimal matrix with the highest
LOO values. To address this issue, we developed GPS 2.0 algorithm with an additional
approach of matrix mutation (MaM) (Xue et al., 2008). First BLOSUM62 matrix was chosen
as the initial matrix. The performance (Sn and Sp) of LOO validation was calculated. For the
prediction of kinase-specific phosphorylation sites, we fixed Sp at 90% to improve Sn by
randomly picking out an element of the matrix for +1 or -1. The procedure was terminated
when the Sn value was not increased any further. Although matrix mutation in other types
was also valid, the MaM strategy can improve the LOO result significantly, whereas the selfconsistency was only influenced moderately. Thus, such a procedure made the predictor
more robust and stable. By comparison, the GPS 2.0 exhibited superior performance against
other analogous tools (Xue et al., 2008).

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

In GPS 1.x algorithms, numerous PKs were casually classified into several groups simply
based on sequence comparison by BLAST, based on the hypothesis that PKs in a same
group/subfamily will recognize similar sequence patterns of substrates for modification
(Xue et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2004). Because the kinomes of several eukaryotic organisms
have been comprehensively identified, phylogenetically analyzed, and classified into a
hierarchical structure, including group, family, subfamily, and single PK (Caenepeel et al.,
2004; Manning et al., 2002), and because most of the phosphorylation sites in the public
database have been experimentally verified in mammals (~97.6%), we adopted the well
established rule for human PK classification (Xue et al., 2008) in GPS 2.0 to cluster various
PKs with their verified sites into a hierarchical structure with four levels, including group,
family, subfamily, and single PK. The PK groups with less than three sites were singled out
(Xue et al., 2008). The training data could be reused several times and included in different
PK clusters based on their known PK information. GPS 2.0 can predict kinase-specific
phosphorylation sites for 408 human PKs in hierarchy.
In GPS 2.0, the PSP(7, 7) was arbitrarily determined (Xue et al., 2008). Later, we carefully
studied how different combinations of PSP(m, n) influenced prediction performance and
robustness (Xue et al., 2011). The self-consistency validation and LOO validation were
thoroughly carried out for each PK group. We observed that the self-consistency results
will be always increased with longer PSP(m, n). However, when the phosphorylated
peptide was elongated, the LOO results will first reach a peak value then decrease. In this
regard, we developed GPS 2.1 algorithm with an additional approach of motif length
selection (MLS) (Xue et al., 2011), which could automatically detect the optimal length of
PSP(m, n) with the highest LOO performance. We exhaustively tested all combinations
of PSP(m, n) (m = 1,…, 15; n = 1, . . ., 15). The Sn values were calculated under the Sp of 85,
90 and 95%. Then the average Sn was calculated as the final Sn value. By comparing
to GPS 2.0 software (Xue et al., 2008), the average Sn of the LOO was significantly
increased by 15.62%, whereas the average Sn value of the self-consistency was slightly
reduced by 2.28%. The Sp score was fixed at 90% for comparison. In this regard, the MLS
method could efficiently narrow down the difference between the LOO validation and
self-consistency validation to improve the robustness of prediction system (Xue et al.,
2011).
The GPS 2.1 algorithm was also adopted for the prediction of sumoylation and palmitoylation
sites, with additional improvements (Ren et al., 2009; Ren et al., 2008). The experimentally
identified sumoylation sites were classified into two types including Type I (consensus) and
Type II (non-consensus) sites in SUMOsp 2.0 (Ren et al., 2009). Type I sites followed the ψKXE
(ψ is A, I, L, M, P, F, or V and X is any amino acid residue) motif, while Type II sites contained
other non-canonical sites. Also, we clustered known palmitoylation sites in CSS-Palm 2.0 into
three groups, including Type I (sites follow a –CC– motif, C is a cysteine residue), Type II (sites
follow a –CXXC– motif, C is a cysteine residue and X is a random residue) and Type III (other
sites) group (Ren et al., 2008). In SUMOsp 1.0 and CSS-Palm 1.0, the threshold is the same for
different clusters. However, for SUMOsp 2.0 and CSS-Palm 2.0, we set different threshold for
each group, separately. The prediction performance of GPS 2.x is much better than GPS 1.x
(Ren et al., 2009; Ren et al., 2008; Xue et al., 2008).
2.3 GPS 3.0 algorithm
Although GPS 1.x and 2.x algorithms were successfully applied in the prediction of
phosphorylation, sumoylation and palmitoylation sites, they exhibited poor performance for

Computational Prediction of Post-Translational Modification Sites in Proteins

111

other PTMs, such as S-nitrosylation (Xue et al., 2010b) and nitration sites (Liu et al., 2011).
Thus, the GPS algorithm still need further improvements.
We hypothesized that one type of PTM can recognize multiple sequence patterns/motifs. If
this hypothesis is correct, the prediction performance can be enhanced by clustering known
PTM sites into multiple groups. In GPS 1.x, the MCL algorithm was adopted to
automatically classify the known phosphorylation site peptides into multiple clusters if
available. However, only eight PK groups obtained more than one cluster (Xue et al., 2005;
Zhou et al., 2004). In CSS-Palm 1.0, we adopted a graph-based BBC method for clustering
known palmitoylation sites, but it can not significantly improve performance for other types
of PTMs (unpublished). In this regard, the clustering strategy was dropped for its low
efficiency in GPS 2.0 for the prediction of phosphorylation sites (Xue et al., 2008). For the
prediction of sumoylation (SUMOsp 2.0) and palmitoylation (CSS-Palm 2.0) sites, we
clustered known sumoylation and palmitoylation into two and three groups based on
reported motifs, although the palmitoylation motifs are much weak (Ren et al., 2009; Ren et
al., 2008). However, for S-nitrosylation and nitration sites, even very weak motifs are not
available (Liu et al., 2011; Xue et al., 2010b). In this regard, an interesting question is how to
classify PTM sites without any obvious motifs? To address this problem, we developed GPS
3.0 algorithm with an additional k-mean clustering method (Liu et al., 2011; Xue et al.,
2010b), which was extensively used in a variety of aspects (Herwig et al., 1999; Yoon et al.,
2007). With the algorithm, we successfully classified 504 experimentally identified Snitrosylation into 3 groups in GPS-SNO 1.0 (Xue et al., 2010b), while the 1,066 known
nitration sites were clustered into 5 groups in GPS-YNO2 1.0 (Liu et al., 2011).
Again, in GPS 1.x and GPS 2.x, the contribution of each residue for substrate recognition by
enzymes was regarded as equal. However, there were various amino acid preferences in the
residues around the phosphorylation sites for different PKs (Schwartz and Gygi, 2005). For
example, the substrates of CDKs follow a pS-P-X-K motif (pS is the phosphorylated serine),
which indicates that the adjacent proline is critical for the CDK-specific phosphorylation
(Schwartz and Gygi, 2005). Furthermore, the glutamine residue adjacent to the
serine/threonine (S/T-Q) was found to be important for ATM (ataxia telangiectasia
mutated)/ATR (ATM and Rad3-related) recognition (Matsuoka et al., 2007). In this regard,
the different contributions of distinct positions around the PTM sites should be considered
and included in the computational model. In this regard, an additional approach of weight
training (WT) was added in GPS 3.0 algorithm. We optimized the weight of each position in
the PTM site peptide PSP(m, n) for every cluster according to the leave-one-out performance
(Liu et al., 2011; Xue et al., 2010b).
Together with MaM and MLS approaches, we determined the order of training processes to
be: k-means clustering, MLS, WT and MaM. By exhaustively testing, it was found that this
training order cannot be changed (Liu et al., 2011; Xue et al., 2010b). The prediction
performance of GPS 3.0 is much better than GPS 1.x and GPS 2.x algorithms. The GPS 3.0
was firstly introduced and described in the construction of GPS-SNO 1.0 and GPS-YNO2 1.0
(Liu et al., 2011; Xue et al., 2010b). Below, we used palmitoylation as an example to depict
the implementation process in detail.

3. An application: Prediction of palmitoylation sites with GPS 3.0 algorithm
In order to describe the GPS series algorithms thoroughly, here we employed the GPS 3.0
algorithm to predict palmitoylation sites as an example. Palmitoylation is the only type of

112

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

reversible lipid modification, and dynamically regulates protein trafficking and functions
through addition of saturated 16-carbon palmitic acids to specific cysteine residues by
DHHC palmitoyltransferases (Fukata and Fukata, 2010; Linder and Deschenes, 2007). First,
we manually collected the experimentally identified palmitoylation sites from scientific
literatures in PubMed. Redundant homologous sites were cleared, while the positive and
negative data sets were prepared. The procedures of performance improvement with an
order of k-means clustering, MLS, WT and MaM were described in detail. Finally, the CSSPalm 3.0 software packages were implemented in JAVA. The full process of CSS-Palm 3.0
construction is shown in Fig. 1.
3.1 Data preparation
Previously, we manually collected the experimental identified palmitoylation sites from
scientific literature which was published before October 8th, 2007 (Ren et al., 2008). Since a
large number of experimental studies were reported after CSS-Palm 2.0 was developed, here
we further searched the literature in PubMed with the keywords of “palmitoylation” and
“palmitoylated” to obtain additional verified palmitoylation sites (before February 14th,
2010). The protein sequences were retrieved from the UniProt database (UniProt, 2010).
In general, if the training data set is highly redundant with too many homologous sites, the
prediction accuracy will be overestimated. To avoid such overestimation, we clustered the
protein sequences with a threshold of 40% identity by CD-HIT (Li and Godzik, 2006). If two
proteins were similar with ≥40% identity, we re-aligned the proteins with BL2SEQ, a
program in the BLAST package (Johnson et al., 2008), and checked the results by hand. If
two palmitoylation sites from two homologous proteins were at the same position after
sequence alignment, only one item was preserved, the other was discarded. Finally, the nonredundant benchmark data set for training contained 439 positive sites from 194 unique
substrates.

Fig. 1. The full procedures of constructing CSS-Palm 3.0 for the prediction of palmitoylation
sites.

Computational Prediction of Post-Translational Modification Sites in Proteins

113

We defined a palmitoylation site peptide PSP(m, n) as a palmitoylated cysteine flanked by m
residues upstream and n residues downstream. As previously described (Ren et al., 2008;
Zhou et al., 2006a), we regarded all experimentally verified palmitoylation sites as positive
data (+), while all other non-palmitoylated cysteine sites in the same substrates were taken
as negative data (-). If a palmitoylated cysteine locates at the N- or C-terminus of the protein
and the length of the peptide is smaller than m+n+1, we added one or multiple “*”
characters as pseudo amino acids to complement the PSP(m, n). Finally, we got 439 positive
sites and 2,171 negative sites.
3.2 The GPS 3.0 algorithm
The GPS 3.0 algorithm contains two major components of scoring strategy and performance
improvement.
Given the hypothesis of similar short peptides bearing similar biochemical properties, the
similarity between two PSP(m, n) of A and B can be calculated with equation (1). Again, if S
(A, B) <0, we simply redefined it as S (A, B)=0. A putative PSP(m, n) is compared with each
of the experimentally verified palmitoylated peptides in a pairwise manner to calculate the
similarity score. The average value of the substitution scores is regarded as the final score.
The schematic description of the scoring strategy with examples was shown in Fig. 2. The
performance improvement processes with of four sequential steps of k-means clustering,
MLS, WT and MaM were presented below.

Fig. 2. Schematic description of the scoring strategy in GPS algorithm.
3.2.1 k-means clustering
In CSS-Palm 2.0, we clustered experimental identified palmitoylation sites into three groups
based on known motifs (Ren et al., 2008). Because the palmitoylation motifs are very weak,
the prediction performance was only considerably improved (Ren et al., 2008). For grouping
known palmitoylation sites, here we used the k-mean clustering approach, which was
widely adopted and got successful performance in our previous studies (Liu et al., 2011; Xue
et al., 2010b). The clustering process was described as below:

114

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

Given two PSP(m, n) peptides A and B, the similarity was defined and measured as:
s(A, B) = Ns/N. The N is the number of all substitutions, whereas the Ns is the number of
conserved substitutions with Score(a, b) > 0 in the BLOSUM62 matrix. The s(A, B) ranges
from 0 to 1. Thus, the distance between them can be defined as: D(A, B) = 1/s(A, B). If
s(A, B) = 0, D(A, B) = ∞. By exhaustive testing, the k was roughly set to 3, while PSP(7, 7) was
adopted. First, three palmitoylation sites from the positive data (+) were randomly chosen
as the centroids. Second, the other positive sites were compared in a pairwise manner with
the three centroids and clustered into groups with the highest similarity values. Third, the
centroid of each cluster was updated with the highest average similarity (HAS). The second
and third steps were iteratively repeated until the clusters did not change any longer. After
the three clusters for the positive sites had been determined, we put each negative site into
the cluster with the HAS.
Given a potential PSP(7, 7) for prediction, we firstly determined which cluster it belongs to,
by calculating the average similarity score of the PSP(7, 7) against each cluster (Fig. 3). For
example, the PSP(7, 7) P1 will be regarded as Cluster 1 type site, while the P2 and P3 will be
determined to be Cluster 2 and 3 type sites, respectively (Fig. 3).

Fig. 3. Prediction of potential palmitoylation sites with the classified clusters.
3.2.2 Motif length selection (MLS)
Previously, the m and n in PSP(m, n) was arbitrarily determined (Xue et al., 2008; Zhou et al.,
2004; Zhou et al., 2006a). In this step, we determined the optimized combination of PSP(m, n)
for optimal performance. The combinations of PSP(m, n) (m = 1, …, 30; n = 1, …, 30) were
extensively tested. The optimal PSP(m, n) for each cluster was separately selected, with the
highest LOO performance. From our previous experience, a higher Sp value is more
important than a higher Sn to avoid too many false positive hits (Ren et al., 2009; Ren et al.,
2008; Xue et al., 2005). Thus, to improve the prediction performance and robustness in the
region of high Sp is more important than other regions. In this study, we fixed the Sp at 90%
to compare Sn values.

3.2.3 Weight training (WT)
We updated the substitution score between two PSP(m, n) peptides A and B as below:

S' ( A, B) 



 m i  n

wi Score( A[ i], B[ i])

(2)

The wi is the weight of position i. Again, if S’(A, B)<0, we redefined it as S’(A, B)=0. Initially,
the w was chosen as 1 for each position. We randomly picked out the weight of any position
for +1 or -1, and adopted the manipulation if the Sn score of the re-calculated LOO result with
the Sp fixed at 90% was increased. The process was repeated until convergence was reached.
3.2.4 Matrix mutation (MaM)
Previously, we chose the BLOSUM62 matrix to evaluate the similarity between PSP(m, n).
Later, we observed that different matrices generate various performances (Xue et al., 2008).
For palmitoylation, we also tested a variety of matrices such as BLOSUM30, 45, 62, 90, and
PAM 10, 90, 250 and 500. The self-consistency (red) and LOO (blue) validations were
preformed (Fig. 4). To balance the prediction performance and robustness of the prediction
system, the BLOSUM62 matrix was adopted as the initial matrix in CSS-Palm 3.0.

Fig. 4. Different matrices generate various performances. The ROC curves of self-consistency
and LOO validations were drawn in red and blue, respectively.

116

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

In the MaM process, the LOO result with BLOSUM62 was first calculated. In BLOSUM62,
the substitution score between “*” and other residues is -4 but redefined as 0. Then we fixed
the Sp at 90% to improve Sn by randomly picking out one value from the BLOSUM62 matrix
for mutation (+1 or -1). If the Sn value increased, the mutation was adopted. This process
was terminated when the Sn value was not increased any further. Interestingly, we
observed that when the training time of MaM is long enough, the mutated matrix generated
from other matrices, e.g., BLOSUM45, is exactly identical to the one from BLOSUM62 (Data
not shown). In this regard, the final mutated matrix is not dependent on the initial matrix.
3.3 Software construction
Previously, we only developed the online services for the predictions with PHP/PERL. We
also discussed the general user interface for the predictors of PTMs sites (Zhou et al., 2006b).
When the number of users becomes large, the server will bear high burden with very low
speed. In this regard, we recently constructed computational tools in JAVA, whereas the
online service and local packages were both provided (Liu et al., 2011; Ren et al., 2008; Ren
et al., 2009; Xue et al., 2008; Xue et al., 2010b; Xue et al., 2011). The online service and local
packages of CSS-Palm 3.0 were implemented in JAVA. For the online service, we tested the
CSS-Palm 3.0 on a variety of internet browsers, including Internet Explorer 6.0, Netscape
Browser 8.1.3 and Firefox 2 under the Windows XP Operating System (OS), Mozilla Firefox
1.5 of Fedora Core 6 OS (Linux), and Safari 3.0 of Apple Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) and 10.5
(Leopard). For the Windows and Linux systems, the latest version of Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) package (JAVA 1.4.2 or later versions) of Sun Microsystems should be
pre-installed. However, for Mac OS, CSS-Palm 3.0 can be directly used without any
additional packages. For convenience, we also developed local packages of CSS-Palm 3.0,
which worked with the three major Operating Systems, Windows, Linux and Mac. The
software and the online sever are freely available at: http://csspalm.biocuckoo.org/.
3.4 Performance evaluation and comparison
As previously described (Ren et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2006a), We adopted four standard
measurements, including accuracy (Ac), sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp) and Mathew
correlation coefficient (MCC). Ac illustrates the correct ratio between both positive (+) and
negative (-) data sets, while Sn and Sp represent the correct prediction ratios of positive (+)
and negative data (-) sets respectively. However, when the number of positive data and
negative data differ too much from each other, MCC should be included to evaluate the
prediction performance. The value of MCC ranges from -1 to 1, and a larger MCC value
stands for better prediction performance.
Among the data with positive hits by CSS-Palm 3.0, the real positives are defined as true
positives (TP), while the others are defined as false positives (FP). Among the data with
negative predictions by CSS-Palm 3.0, the real positives are defined as false negatives (FN),
while the others are defined as true negatives (TN). The performance measurements of Ac,
Sn, Sp and MCC are defined as below:
Sn 

To avoid overestimation, the LOO validation and 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-fold cross-validations were
performed to evaluate the prediction robustness and performance of CSS-Palm 3.0. Receiver
Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves are presented in Fig. 5A, while the AROCs (area
under ROCs) were calculated as 0.889 (leave-one-out), 0.877 (4-fold), 0.879 (6-fold), 0.887 (8fold) and 0.906 (10-fold), respectively (Fig. 5A). Since the 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-fold cross-validations
were close to the leave-one-out validation, it was demonstrated that CSS-Palm 3.0 is a robust
predictor of palmitoylation sites with promising performance.

3.0 algorithms.
For comparison, we also calculated the performance of GPS 1.0 and 2.0 algorithms. To avoid
any bias, the same training data set used in GPS 3.0 was also employed in the two methods.
The LOO validations were carried out for GPS 1.0 and 2.0 algorithms, while the ROC curves
were drawn (Fig. 5B). The AROC values were calculated as 0.811 (GPS 1.0), 0.827 (GPS 2.0)
and 0.889 (GPS 3.0), respectively. In addition, we fixed the Sp values and compared Sn
scores (Table 2). When the Sp value was ~85%, the Sn values of GPS 3.0, GPS 2.0 and GPS 1.0
were 72.44%, 48.29% and 43.05%, respectively (Table 2). Also, when the Sp value was ~90%,
the Sn values of GPS 3.0, GPS 2.0 and GPS 1.0 were 80.64%, 59.68% and 54.21%, separately
(Table 2). In addition, when the Sp value was ~95%, the Sn of GPS 3.0 (82.23%) was still
much better than GPS 2.0 (67.20%) and GPS 1.0 (62.41%) (Table 2). Taken together, our
results exhibited that the performance of GPS 3.0 is better than GPS 1.0 and 2.0. Finally, the

4. Conclusion
During the past several decades, accumulated experimental studies have made slow but
steady contributions toward understanding molecular mechanisms and regulatory roles of
various PTMs (Mann and Jensen, 2003; Walsh, 2005; Walsh and Jefferis, 2006). Recently,
rapid progresses in the state-of-the-art HTP-MS techniques have boomed an explosion of
modification data for systematically analyzing PTM regulation in a proteomic level
(Choudhary and Mann, 2010). However, the biological functions of PTMs are still far from
fully elucidated. In this regard, more efforts remain to be carried out.
In contrast with expensive and error-prone experimental methods, in silico prediction of
PTM-specific substrates with their sites has emerged as a popular alternative approach. In
this field, two questions should be addressed: 1) How to predict modification sites in a given
protein sequence? 2) How to predict regulatory enzyme information of modification sites in
a given protein sequence? The importance of the two questions is different for distinct types
of PTMs. For example, a phosphoproteomics analysis can detect thousands of
phosphorylation sites in a single experiment (Olsen et al., 2006; Villen et al., 2007). In this
regard, the prediction of general or non-specific phosphorylation sites is not much useful at
the current stage. However, there are only ~3,500 phosphorylation sites with known
upstream PK information in the public databases (Xue et al., 2008; Xue et al., 2011). In this
regard, the prediction of kinase-specific phosphorylation sites is still a great challenge, while
the results can be a help for further experimental consideration. For sumoylation and
palmitoylation, accurately large-scale identification of their substrates and sites is not easy to
be performed. In this regard, the prediction of general sumoylation and palmitoylation in
proteins is useful for guiding further experimental verifications. Also, since the
experimentally identified enzyme-specific information for both sumoylation and
palmitoylation is quite limited, the prediction of enzyme-specific sumoylation or
palmitoylation is still not available due to data limitation.
Intuitively, the prediction of PTM sites seems to be a trivial job. Assume that one may easily
obtain experimentally identified PTMs from one or two review articles as the training data
set, casually select a machine learning algorithm such as PSSM, SVMs or ANN, carry out

Computational Prediction of Post-Translational Modification Sites in Proteins

several validations to evaluate the performance, and develop a web server for the
prediction. Then the manuscript can be written with a cup of coffee in hand. Previously, a
number of researchers asked us by personal communications that why we did not used a
simple existed algorithm to develop an integrate tool for the prediction of all types of PTMs
sites. Is the prediction of PTMs sites really simple? From our research experience, the
answer is “not at all”. First, most of widely-used machine learning algorithms are derived
from the fields of informatics or statistics and originally designed for general propose, but
not specifically for PTMs sites prediction. Second, different types of PTMs can have distinct
sequence features. One algorithm can generate promising performance for a specific PTM
but exhibit poor accuracy for other types of PTMs. For example, the prediction of PKAspecific phosphorylation sites with any algorithm can generate satisfying performance (Xue
et al., 2008). However, for PTMs with strong motifs, the scenario is different. For example,
the sumoylation has a strong consensus motif of ψKXE, which about 77% of all known
sumoylation sites follow this pattern (Xue et al., 2006b). Since the simple strong motif can
generate great accuracy, development of new algorithms will not be necessary if the
performance can not be significantly improved. For palmitoylation, two weak motifs can be
obtained (Ren et al., 2008). Prediction of palmitoylation with weak motifs will generate poor
performance. But it’s also difficult for computational algorithm to retrieve informative
features for prediction. In addition, for S-nitrosylation and nitration, even weak motifs are
not available (Liu et al., 2011; Xue et al., 2010b). In this regard, development a novel and
useful algorithm specifically for PTMs site prediction is an urgent demand. Also, great
attention needs to be paid since different PTMs have different properties.

Fig. 6. Comparison of CSS-Palm 3.0 and CKSAAP-Palm (Wang et al., 2009).
During the past several years, our group take great efforts on designing and improve the
GPS series algorithms, which were specifically designed for the prediction of PTM sites in
proteins. Although the preliminary GPS 1.x algorithms could be only comparative to other
approaches, the GPS 2.x exhibited superior performance against analogous predictors. The
latest version of GPS 3.0 algorithm has been further improved and much better than our
GPS 2.x algorithms. As an application, we used this algorithm to construct CSS-Palm 3.0 for

120

the prediction of palmitoylation sites. By comparison of a recently released predictor of
CKSAAP-Palm (Wang et al., 2009), the performance of CSS-Palm 3.0 is significantly better
(Fig. 6).
Finally, we do not propose that the GPS 3.0 will be the final version, while more strategies
will be developed and included in GPS series algorithms. We anticipated that the
combination of computational predictions and experimental verifications will become the
foundation of systematically understanding the mechanisms and the dynamics of PTMs.

1. Introduction
The scientific community is well aware of the fact that the very presence of internet
profoundly affects the way research is done. Internet is the major infrastructure through
which results and data are communicated and shared, computing is parallelized,
collaborations are started and enlarged, papers are published, and a myriad of other
transactions are performed, so to involve nearly all aspects of everyday researcher’s life.
Perhaps surprisingly, scientists paid little attention to the theoretical study of internet
structure (i.e. topology) and of its dynamical behavior, until quite recently.
Even more surprisingly, however, when they did it, it quickly emerged some very rarely
found scientific truth, of such a general kind, to directly reverberate from Internet studies
into the field of molecular and cellular biology, with very small (if any) changes.
Consequences manifested immediately, so that, at the turning of the millennium, in a now
classical Nature paper (Vogelstein B. et al., 2000), Vogelstein, Lane and Levine, the
discoverers of p53 and of its role as tumor-suppressor, wrote that “The cell, like the Internet,
appears to be a ‘scale-free network’.” To let the reader fully appreciate this revolution, it is
useful to recall that in 1999, just one year before the appearance of this particular paper,
more than 15.000 independent articles have been already published on p53 and its role in
cancer biology, making this protein one of the most studied topics ever. Yet, after 20 years of
research, despite the enormous amount of available data, some aspects of p53 biology were
still missing, and were so crucial to understand why this protein is found mutated in about
50% of cancer patients, to let its discoverer write “One way to understand the p53 network is
to compare it to the Internet” (Vogelstein B. et al., 2000).
What had it happened? To understand this, we must look only two years before. In 1998,
Zoltan Oltvai, a molecular pathologist, and Lazlo Barabási, a physicist studying Internet
topology, were both working at the Northeastern University of Chicago. They both were
Hungarians –actually Barabási was born Romanian, but lived and studied in Hungary have small kids, and were home neighbors; thus it is hardly surprising that, as recalled by
Barabási himself (Barabási AL, 2002), they usually met for dinner. By that time, Barabási had
already found out that the Internet structure is a peculiar one: he had collected evidence that
it is far from random. This was a non trivial result, given the fact that all large networks
were modeled at the time as random. To understand this point, we have to think of

126

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

networks made of a huge number of nodes, like human social networks, communication
networks and alike. To study how they work, i.e. how information spreads through the
network, or whether the network is sensitive to external attacks, or how to find the best
pathway from one node to another, it is not possible to perform a direct experiment, given
the size of the object under study; instead, one has to model the network, then find out a
proper set of equations, and simulate the behavior of the network varying the equation
parameters. Since the 60s, the model of choice for large networks was that of Erdős and
Rényi, which assumes that each node in a network is randomly connected to a fixed,
average number of other nodes. As Barabási explains (Barabási AL, 2002), Erdős and Rényi
“acknowledged for the first time that real graphs, from social networks to phone lines, are
not nice and regular. They are hopelessly complicated. Humbled by their complexity, [they]
assumed that these networks are random.” In a random network, each node is equivalent to
every else. Were the real network random, this would have several practical implications.
For example, removing one server from Internet, was it a random network, would have on
average the same effect of removing every other node, so that to protect Internet from
hackers one should only care that, on average, a sufficiently high number of servers is
shielded, wherever they are.
However, you could have already guessed that removing 100 servers from the Google
facilities would have a larger impact on Internet than shutting down 100 servers in rural
China (at least presently). This is due to the fact that Google machines are Internet hubs, i.e.
they are continuously connected to an enormous number of other machines, and mediate a
big amount of Internet data exchange. Barabási and its group were the first to notice the
presence of hubs in the web (for example, the New York Times web site has an immense
number of links, whereas an obscure blogger may have none), and recognized that the
classical network theory of Erdős and Rényi was totally unable to deal with them.
To see whether this was a peculiarity of Internet or a general finding, they began to map the
topology of other networks as well. It turned that 1) most real networks are different from
both regular lattices and random structures and 2) they all exhibit a common underlying
organization, based on few hubs and many poorly connected nodes. This last point is
evident if one plots the number of nodes having a defined amount of connections, which is
called node degree or connectivity, versus the degree itself. One gets a curve (the degree
distribution), which smoothly descends from a maximum (many nodes with very low
connectivity) to a minimum (few nodes with very high connectivity); since this curve is
exponential, the obtained degree distribution obeys a power-law and is said to be scale-free.
Having already obtained the first evidence for the generality of its finding on network
structure, Barabási met Oltvai, who, like the majority of the biologists, was very well aware
of the intricacy of metabolic connections between the molecular constituents of a living cell.
Indeed, the complicate diagrams on the walls of biochemistry labs represent complex
networks, were the nodes are biomolecules of any sort, and the links are biological
interactions (let us keep this description vague for the moment). The two researchers
wondered if these biological networks were also scale free as those made by man. By 2002,
Barabási and Oltvai had published their results obtained from 43 different organisms
(Ravasz E et al., 2002): the metabolic networks connecting the main metabolites have
essentially the same large-scale structure of complex, non-biological networks. They are all
scale-free, with hubs and poorly connected nodes, despite significant differences in the
particular biochemical pathways included, so that each cell of every examined organism
resembles a tiny Internet and can be studied in pretty much the same way.

127

With a perfect timing and a great deal of intuition, Vogelstein, Lane and Levine realized
that, when looking to cancer, p53 is indeed a crucial hub, sitting in the center of a complex
protein network, and, very much like internet hacking, cellular hijacking by cancer proceeds
by attacking hubs. This is why, ex post, one finds p53 mutated so many times: touching a
cellular hub causes a great deal of effects, while mutating less prominent “client” proteins
passes nearly unnoticed. This is also what brought the three researchers to publish the paper
which changed p53 science forever.
Since these early observations, a lot of progresses have been made, to the point that protein
networks are useful tools in the hands of molecular biologists. The rest of this chapter is
devoted to a simple introduction to their structure and properties, in a way that purportedly
simplify mathematical descriptions, keeping an eye on the biological meaning of protein
networks.

2. The structure of protein networks: Scale freeness
Before entering in some details about protein networks, we want to point out some special
characteristics of this type of networks.
First of all, one should keep in mind that a protein network is an abstract representation of
the real world, instead of a physical entity like the Internet infrastructure or a phone line
web. In particular, while for the latter the links between the nodes are physical (cables in
both cases), in the former case the links represent only a potential interaction between two
proteins. With the notable exception of macromolecular complexes, which can be thought of
as networks of interacting proteins, one would never be able to visualize a protein web
under a microscope.
Secondly, with the same exception mentioned before, molecular biologists do usually deal
with a special type of protein network, one where the nodes represent all of the protein
copies coded by a single gene, instead of all the individual proteins which are floating
around in a cell. The protein network we will refer to in the following, thus, is a graph
which resumes all the known interactions (the links) occurring between the product of every
gene out of some list (the nodes); in this respect, such a network is more like a map of our
current knowledge about some specific ensemble of proteins then a representation of a real
molecular web.
As a third point, a simplification is usually made, by considering only one type of
interaction between the proteins composing a given network. The links connecting the
nodes thus correspond to one out of a number of possible biological interactions, ranging
from very specific types -such as a network where a link between two proteins represents a
physical interaction in a molecular complex- to broader concepts -such as a network where a
link between two proteins occurs if they are found co-expressed in a given condition.
Correspondingly, different protein networks can be obtained, joining the nodes according to
different types of interaction: protein-protein interaction networks, transcription networks,
enzymatic networks, signaling networks, co-expression networks and so on. However, one
should not consider this simplification as an absolute constraint: software does exist, for
example, which is able to color the links of a network according to the type of interaction,
filtering them as wanted.
We can now start examining an example. Let us consider the human protein-protein
interaction network, which can be downloaded from the Reactome organization
institutional site (http://www.reactome.org/download/index.html). At the time when this

128

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

chapter was written, data were available for more than 5000 proteins, summing up to 120661
unique physical interactions (including homomeric interactions, i.e. interactions between
identical proteins). These links do not imply any directed action from a given protein to its
connected neighbors; thus, as opposite to other types of protein networks, such as
transcriptional networks, signaling networks and alike, the protein-protein interaction
network is said to be undirected. The network, on the left of figure 1, is represented as a
sphere of densely connected dots (the proteins).

Fig. 1. Human protein-protein interaction network
On the right of figure 1, the degree distribution for this network is plotted on a log-log scale;
as evident by the linearity of the obtained graph (red line), this distribution follows a power
law, of the form:
n ~ k-

(1)

and the network is scale-free. This fact in turn implies that there are few protein hubs,
connected to most of all other proteins in the network, and a vast majority of proteins able to
bind only few partners (poorly connected nodes). Hubs will be treated extensively in the
next paragraph; instead, we will focus here on the properties imparted to a protein network
by its scale-free nature.
First of all, let us consider the effects of removing some nodes from a scale-free protein
network. To this aim, consider the network in figure 2.
On the left, upper corner, low-degree nodes were selected for removal (and are colored in
yellow); the resulting network is on the left, lower corner. As evident, the effects are quite
limited, and all remaining nodes are still fully connected. Consider now the removal of the
same number of high-degree nodes, as shown in the upper, right corner of figure 2. The
network falls apart (right, lower corner) and among the remaining nodes, there are
examples of disconnected proteins, like the ones pointed by red arrows (which are not the
only ones, if you look carefully). Since high-degree nodes are very rare in a scale free
network, if compared to low-degree ones, you may have already guessed that protein
networks are very resistant to random removal of nodes: if we really selected nodes by
chance, than they will nearly always be peripheral, poorly connected proteins. As a
consequence, to have even a slight probability of hitting a well-connected protein by
random selection, we have to remove a disproportionately high number of nodes, or to
repeat the selection process several times. This property of scale-free networks is called

Protein Networks: Generation, Structural Analysis and Exploitation

129

robustness. In the case of protein networks, robustness has some interesting biological
consequences. First of all, it implies that low-frequency, random events such as protein
mutations will really affect the cell – which relies for its functioning on several different
types of proteins and biochemical networks – with an exceedingly low probability. Thus, we
can say that, even before our immune system takes action against malfunctioning cells, we
are protected by potentially dangerous random insults – which could give rise to serious
diseases such as cancer - by the very architecture of the cell protein networks. On the
opposite side, scale-free determined robustness means that the cell has some true Achille’s
heels – the few highly connected proteins – which can be exploited by selective attacks.
Once again, we can refer to Internet for an useful comparison: selective, non random attacks
to central routers are preferred by hackers, which purportedly aim to take control over the
attacked networks. At cellular level, viruses can be considered hackers, which divert the
protein network operations toward an illegitimate scope. Indeed, it has been found by
several independent groups that viruses selectively target central proteins, causing large
effects on the host protein network (de Chassey B. et al., 2008; Navratil V. et al., 2011; Zou X.
et al., 2010).

Fig. 2. The effects of removing nodes from a protein network: random removal (left) versus
hub removal (right)
Beside robustness, scale-free protein networks show another interesting feature. They
exhibit a small-world behavior: hopping from one node to a neighbor, any node can be
reached from any other in few steps. The distance L between any couple of nodes, in
particular, grows roughly proportional to the logarithm of the number of nodes N which are
included in the network:

130

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

L ~ Log(N)

(2)

For protein-protein interaction networks, L grows even slower with N, and the average
distance between two nodes is so small that they have been defined ultrasmall networks
(Cohen R & Havlin S. 2003). The small-world property, shared by many complex networks,
is particular relevant to biology when the considered network is made of proteins which can
influence the neighbors through the links. This is typically the case of transcriptional
networks, were two proteins are connected if one influences the expression of the other,
signaling network, were proteins are coupled through phosphorylation and other posttranslational modifications, and in general holds true for any protein network where the
activity of one protein affects its connected partners. In these cases, the small-world
structure implies that whatever stimulus changes the status or activity of a protein, its
effects will rapidly propagate to the entire network, since on average only few proteins will
separate the starting node from every other in the net. This in turn has the consequence that
a cell, once its protein network has been stimulated at a single, peripheral node, may quickly
change the status of a large number of proteins in response, so that the original signal
propagates to a vast number of different proteins, synchronizing their status to the variation
of the external stimulus. In other words, small-world protein networks, like any other smallworld, display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and
synchronizability (Watts DJ & Strogatz SH. 1998).
In the case of scale-free networks, the observed robustness and the small-world effect are
mutually connected. In particular, since protein hubs are linked to the vast majority of all
other nodes, most of the pathways connecting any couple of nodes pass through hubs, so
that the average distance between any two nodes in the network does not change much if
nodes are removed randomly: this is a formulation of network robustness equivalent to the
one we mentioned before. At the same time, the more an hub is prominent, i.e. it is
connected to an higher amount of protein nodes, the more the distance between any two
uncoupled nodes will tend to a single hop through the hub. Hubs are thus key features of
scale-free network, mediating both robustness and small-world properties of protein
networks; we will dedicate the next paragraph to examine their properties.

3. The structure of protein networks: Hubs
Since the early times of protein network studies, the few, always present hubs attracted a lot
of attention: quite naturally, it was thought that since highly connected proteins have a lot of
different molecular partners, they should also be implied in the majority of the cellular
processes. In case of a protein interaction network like the one depicted in figure 2, this
reasoning goes as follows: proteins found in many different macromolecular complexes,
represented as hubs in the interaction network, should be either core components of a single
molecular complex, or elements conserved in many different molecular complexes, which
works as switches and are used by the cell to coordinate the activation or repression of
different molecular machineries. As a consequence, any alteration of the hubs of a proteinprotein interaction network is predicted to have large effects on the cell biology. This
assumption, which has been dubbed as “centrality-lethality rule”, has been extensively
explored by experimentally knocking-down protein interaction hubs and quantitatively
assessing the effects in different models (Jeong H. et al., 2011). Going a step further in the
reasoning, it has been hypothesized that mutations affecting these proteins should be

Protein Networks: Generation, Structural Analysis and Exploitation

131

particularly related to the insurgence of diseases. Some experimental validation of this
prediction has been indeed obtained: Rambaldi and his group (Rambaldi D. et al., 2008)
provided evidence that virtually all proteins having a degree higher than 80 in the human
protein-protein interaction network are target of known cancer-related mutations. Similarly,
Ortutay and Vihinen (Ortutay C. & Vihinen M. et al., 2009), after building an interaction
network comprising all human proteins involved in immune response, found that the
network hubs include known disease-causing genes as well as 26 new genes related to
primary immunodeficiency. In a further example, Chang and colleagues (Chang W. et al.,
2009), found new gastric cancer candidate markers by looking to hubs in a protein-protein
interaction network build from genes differentially expressed in the patient tissues.
So far, we looked to hubs in protein-protein interaction networks. However, hubs are a
common characteristic of any complex web, albeit their biological meaning and relevance
change according to the particular type of protein network considered. To understand this
point, let us compare the three different human protein networks reported in figure 3.

Fig. 3. A) Co-expression network; B) Biochemical/metabolic network; C) Process specific
network
The first network on the left (network A) is obtained by considering all proteins
differentially expressed in breast cancer patients. Proteins are connected if they are found
co-expressed in at least 2 different and independent experiments, and the resulting network
is a co-expression network. The central network (network B) is build by considering all the
proteins which are linked to the p53 human protein by some known biochemical pathway,
and is then a biochemical/metabolic network. The last network on the right (network C) is a
network reporting all those proteins controlled by p53 or controlling it during the unfolding
of the apoptotic process, and can be seen as a process specific network. You may have already
noticed that hubs (and scale-freeness) are present in all three webs, despite the fact that the
network size decreases from left to right. However, the biological relevance of hubs is very
different in the three network.
In network A, hubs are cancer markers which are found co-expressed with nearly any other
cancer protein. Hubs in this network are not granted to be very relevant for the pathogenesis
of breast cancer: they can be proteins which are deregulated by the inflammation
accompanying cancer, as well as cytoskeletal proteins altered due to the hyperproliferation
of cancer cells or other type of very abundant proteins, with no specific role in cancer
progression and insurgence. While these proteins are indeed dysregulated in breast cancer,
and thus are useful for diagnosing it, their status of hubs do not privilege them with respect

132

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

to other, less connected nodes, since their co-occurrence with many partners does not imply
that their expression level changes more than that of any other node in the network. Indeed,
the list of hubs of network A includes useful diagnostic proteins, such as ERBB2, ESR1 and
BCRA1, as well as proteins with little meaning for cancer diagnosis, such as complement
proteins. Thus, for co-expression networks like the one depicted in figure 3A, being an hub
is of no particular merit for a protein.
In network B, since by construction each neighbor of a specific hub is connected to p53 by
some biochemical chain, hubs are at the crossroad of several cellular pathway involving p53.
In this respect, hubs of this network are in a prominent position to act as checkpoints for
controlling the (very redundant) flow of biochemical information from and toward p53, and
thus we can expect them to be important controllers and mediators of p53 activity. For
example, we found in network B that the 15 hubs with the highest degree are all different
subunits of all the three mammalian RNA polymerase, but two, which are important
transcription factors (TF2A and TF2B); this is hardly surprising, since p53 in the very end
exerts its prominent and multiple actions regulating the transcriptional process, so that all
p53 pathways converge into the regulation of the RNA polymerase machinery. By
considering hubs with a lower degree, we find the mitosis controlling kinase NEK-2, the
nuclear cap-binding protein 1 and 2, and several other proteins which have prominent roles
in regulating the cellular status. As a general rule, although there are exceptions, the lower is
the degree, the more specific is the position of the protein in the p53 network (or the lesser is
known about it). For example, among the proteins having k=1, we find the liprin alpha 4, a
protein which binds to the intracellular membrane-distal phosphatase domain of tyrosine
phosphatase LAR, and appears to localize LAR for regulating the disassembly of focal
adhesion and orchestrating cell-matrix interactions; or E2F-3, a transcription factor which
binds specifically to the protein RB1 , in a cell-cycle dependent manner; or MDB4, the
Methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 4, which is a mismatch-specific DNA N-glycosylase
involved in DNA repair, specific for G:T mismatches within CpG sites. Thus, for
biochemical/metabolic networks like the one depicted in figure 3B, hubs are checkpoints for
most of the pathways considered in building the network (in the presented case, p53-related
pathways), acting as crucial mediators of biological activity and behaving like switches for
several biochemical pathways. On the opposite site, if interested to specific, less studied
biochemical players, one should concentrate on low-degree nodes of the network, a group
which is enriched in proteins involved in few, specific metabolic modules.
In network C, starting from p53, nodes are attached if they co-occur in at least one
biochemical pathway and are involved in apoptosis. The fact that two proteins co-occur in
more than one pathway is represented by multiple links. This network can be considered as
extracted from network B, by filtering out those proteins not involved in apoptosis. As for
network B, hubs of this network are to be considered prominent biochemical regulators;
however, since we are restricted to a single, specific biological process, there is no special
role for low-degree proteins, which are simply peripheral players in a specific apoptotic
pathway, among the many redundant possibilities. Hubs are thus the only targets for the
analysis of network C: they are important mediators of p53-related apoptosis, controlling
most of the network, and their knocking out can be expected to perturb largely the apoptotic
control of the cell. As a matter of fact, ordering by degree the nodes of this network, after
p53, which is trivially an hub, we find MDM2, possibly the most important regulator of p53
mediated apoptosis, and the apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53 ASPP2, which influences
the apoptotic response of cells without affecting p53-induced cell cycle arrest. On the

Protein Networks: Generation, Structural Analysis and Exploitation

133

opposite side, we find cdc42, an important cellular protein, which nonetheless mediates only
one of the apoptotic pathways controlled by p53 (Thomas A. et al., 2000). Thus, for networks
like that depicted in figure 3C, hubs may be considered the most relevant proteins to be
found involved in the selected biological process, and they can be safely assumed as targets
for further analysis.
After the preceding discussion, it should be clear at this point that protein hubs are
extremely variable in their relevance, and that before considering the degree of a node as a
topological guide to prioritize protein lists, one must carefully select the type of network to
be used, i.e. the rule to generate links between nodes. However, even having the best
network may be not enough. To understand why, let us first make a general consideration
and then go on with an example.

Fig. 4. Sampling bias in biological networks
As shown in figure 4, we must face a sampling problem. “Sampling”, in this context, means
to accumulate knowledge on a specific node or part of the network, useful to define its
connectivity. In facts, whatever biological network we are exploring, we are only getting an
incomplete representation of the real thing, one which was produced by a finite number of
experiments interrogating a biological entity. If sampling of the real network (sitting on the
lower plane in figure 4) is non-random, i.e. it is concentrated around some “hot” protein
(represented in red), then we get a skewed representation (sitting on the upper plane in
figure 4) where nodes originally having the same degree are represented as very different in
the reconstructed network. Besides being biased, the representation we have can also be
error-prone. For example, in figure 4 many links are missing on the upper plane as
compared to the lower one (negative error); the opposite situation, were extra links are
erroneously added to the representation – for example due to non-specific binding in
protein interaction experiments – is also common. Both errors and biases obviously affect
the definition of hubs in a network. However, while simple tests exist to check whether an
identified hub is a genuine one in an error-prone web (Vallabhajosyula RR. et al., 2009), bias
may have subtler effects, much more difficult to deal with. To see this last point, let us
consider a further example.
On the left of figure 5, there is a co-expression network which includes all proteins studied
in breast cancer. Two proteins are connected if, by any experimental method, they were
found to be co-expressed in a breast cancer human sample, whatever the stage or the

134

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

provenance of the sample. Proteins which are known targets for drug currently used to treat
breast cancer or under development are highlighted in red. On the right of the same figure,
there is a box-plot which shows the degree distribution for nodes which have been never
entered the drug development process (first box on the left), are in preclinical development
(second box), are in clinical development phases (phase I, II and III corresponding to the
third, fourth and fifth box respectively) and are already on the market (last box on the right).
A clear trend may be seen, with the degree regularly increasing as the clinical development
of a target proceeds. Is this a genuine trend to be used for drug target identification, i.e. is it
true that the more a protein is an hub, the better is to target it from a pharmacological
perspective? Quite the opposite. If we consider the same network in a temporal perspective,
we will see why. Have a look at figure 6. For the sake of simplicity, we will focus on three
exemplary pharmaceutical targets in breast cancer (the vascular endothelial growth factor
VEGF, the tymidilate synthase TYMS and the clusterin CLU).

Fig. 5. Degree distribution for pharmacological targets in a breast cancer co-expression
network
We want to study their position as hub during time, to see whether it is constant or changes, as
new experiments are performed and new network nodes are added. Since the network grows
in time, instead of the degree we will consider the ratio between the degree and the total
number of nodes; this is the fraction of network nodes connected to the considered protein,
and we will refer to this quantity as to “net occupancy”. You may have already noticed that
this quantity varies in an unpredictable manner. Something connected to about 6.5% of all
network nodes in 1993 (TYMS), a true hub for the network, became connected to less than 1%
in 2002, to go back to about 3% in 2009. VEGF, which was an important hub in 2009, was
barely connected to the network before 1997, and was certainly not an hub by that time. From
the graph, we can notice three temporal points associated to an abrupt trend change for all the
selected proteins: 2002 for TYMS, 1997 for VEGF and 2005 for CLU. What happened at the

Protein Networks: Generation, Structural Analysis and Exploitation

135

time? In 2002, pemetrexed, a drug targeting TYMS, was introduced for breast cancer therapy;
in 1997, the antiangiogenic therapy was hypothesized as an option to treat breast cancer; in
2002, the experimental drug OTX-111, targeting CLU, was shifted to prostate cancer, due to
mixed results in breast cancer trials. We can thus directly observe that, in the selected cases, the
industrial interest immediately precedes a topological change of a protein in the network,
promoting to hubs those proteins which are under industrial development, and downsizing
those proteins which were not up to the standard in clinical trials. Such kind of an effect may
also be caused by interests different from the industrial ones. For example, it is probable that
strong academic groups tend to produce a lot of data on their “pet” proteins; moreover, most
studied proteins tend understandably to be of human origin, well soluble, stable and easily
detected. Large scale “unbiased” experiments, such those using microarrays, two-yeast hybrid
or proteomic techniques, produce data which are also biased toward detectable proteins
(Ivanic J. et al., 2009), and are still very often affected by the interest of the experimenter (think
to the study of knock-out models). Some possible solutions which have the potential to
mitigate biases as well as errors in reconstructing protein networks have been recently
proposed. These approaches make use of network alignment between different organisms
(Tan CS. Et al., 2009). In particular, evidence has been recently produced demonstrating that
even though the present protein network data are strongly biased by the experimental
methods used to produce them, they still exhibit species–specific similarity and reproducibility
(Fernandes LP. Et al., 2010). While intra-species conservation approaches tend to contribute
“core” networks, i.e. networks made of conserved proteins and conserved topologies which do
not account for inter-species variability, they have the indubitable advantage to average biases
(because the networks used for the alignment come from different scientific communities, and
are less vexed by pharmaceutical industry interests) and errors (because more large scale
experiments are taken into accounts). Moreover, hubs conserved among different species are
likely to be very relevant for the basic biology of the cell, as shown by the fact that they tend to
be duplicated so to increase the mutational robustness of the corresponding biological network
(Kafri R. et al., 2008)

We want to conclude this paragraph by the following message: when properly taking into
account biases and errors, the topological prominence of hubs is indeed informative and
useful for protein/gene prioritization; however, the real biological meaning of “hubbiness”
is strictly dependent on the linking rule applied for building a specific network, as shown in
this paragraph for co-expression networks, biochemical/metabolic networks and process
specific networks.

4. The structure of protein networks: Neighborhoods
In a graph, the neighbors of a given node consist in all those other nodes that are connected
to it up to a certain distance. Distance in this context is intended as the minimal number of
steps connecting the source node to any other. In other words, for a particular protein x in a
network (which we will call the seed), we define the neighborhood of x, N(x), to be the
subgraph of the network whose vertex set consists of all of x’s interaction neighbors and the
edges between them, up to a preselected distance D.
According to the type of graph, neighborhoods can be used to derive useful biological
information.
We will try to illustrate this by showing how:
1. in a network, the biological roles of the neighbors can be used to infer the unknown
functions of a seed;
2. in protein-protein interaction networks, a group of highly interconnected neighbors
sharing a given biological function likely coincides with a macromolecolar complex or
part of it.
As for the first example, it is useful to remember that traditionally the function of a protein
is inferred from its sequence and/or structure by homology modeling. Unsurprisingly, this
approach performs poorly for those proteins which have unusual sequences and unknown
structures. In this particular circumstances, an analysis of the biological functions of the
network neighbors of the protein can be decisive. In particular, it has been proved that in
protein networks the probability that a certain biological function is shared between two
proteins is higher if the 2 considered proteins are proximal neighbors, and then decreases as
the distance D increases (Shamir R. et al., 2007). This is true in many different network
types, such as protein-protein interaction networks, metabolic/biochemical protein
networks, genetic interaction networks etc. Moreover, if a given protein with an unknown
function is at short distance (usually D=1) from several proteins sharing a given function,
the probability that it too shares that particular function is obviously even higher. On this
basis, a neighborhood-guided labeling strategy is possible to assign biological functions to
virtually any protein in a network, providing that at least a fraction of the nodes in its
neighborhood has a known biological role. The process is exemplified in figure 7, were
functional annotation is symbolized by node coloring.
As can be intuitively understood by looking at figure 7, the functional annotation of a given
node is guided by several factors, including distance and number of neighbors with a given
biological function, their own connectivity and their heterogeneity (which led to the lack of
propagation for the red and the blue colors in the example). Mathematical modeling of the
labeling procedure basically consists in weighting all these factors in a single probability
function, so to obtain a score for the assignment of a given biological role to all the network
nodes. While the details of the proposed methods are out of the scope of this introductory
text, we would like to stress here that the procedure depends always on the local topology,

137

Protein Networks: Generation, Structural Analysis and Exploitation

which affects the label propagation by determining the number of neighbors a given node
communicate with, and on the type of network considered, which limits the distance and
the direction of propagation of a label along the edges.

Expanded annotation

Fig. 7. Functional annotation of a given node
As for the second example, we will refer to a recent work of Fox et al. (Fox AD et al., 2011)
on protein-protein interaction networks. Consider in particular the two alternative
situations illustrated in figure 8.
In A, the neighborhood for D=1 of the selected seed (shown in blue) is made of two groups
of nodes, which are not directly connected; on the opposite, in B the neighborhood is highly
interconnected in a single cluster.

A

B

Fig. 8. A) Two disconnected neighborhood; B) Highly interconnected neighborhood
As reported by the authors, the structure observed in A suggests the possibility that the two
groups of neighbors might be active under different conditions, as opposite to B. Indeed, it
was found that single-component neighborhoods like the one represented in B are enriched
in protein sharing similar functions and participating to molecular complexes, and are thus
more likely to represent a single, defined protein complex, while multiple-components
neighborhoods like the one represented in A tend to represent different molecular
complexes, sharing a single component. Interestingly, we found that this concept can be
extended beside protein-protein interaction networks. Let us consider, for example, all those
proteins, which are reported as changed in expression by at least two different papers on
Parkinson’s Disease. We will consider two proteins connected, if they co-occur at least 2

138

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

times, i.e. if they are reported together by at least two papers. The obtained co-expression
network is shown in figure 9A.

Fig. 9. A) Parkinson’s Disease co-expression network; B) A clique from the same network
(red nodes have many connections outside the clique).
On the right, in figure 9B, a neighborhood of 14 proteins is extracted from the network,
which are all fully interconnected (meaning that each protein is connected to any other).
Among these 14 proteins, the red ones are those which have at least as many bonds outside
the neighborhood as they have inside it (i.e. at least 13 bonds outside the network). These 14
proteins are arranged in a way similar to that exemplified in figure 8B: a single cluster of
highly connected nodes. Much in the same way predicted for protein-protein interaction
networks, the cluster is enriched in proteins sharing some functional aspect: in particular, it
turns out that 13 out of the 14 components are found in inclusion bodies, a hallmark of
neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s Disease. Intriguingly, in a sense they represent once again
a macromolecular complex – albeit a non-specific one, being a structurally random
aggregate, which may vary in its particular composition from case to case. Thus, while the
starting network is a co-expression network, where edges do not represent physical
interactions among proteins, also in this case proteins in well connected neighborhoods tend
to share biological functions and to be involved in the formation of complexes.

5. The structure of protein networks: Graphlet degree signatures
Until now, we have examined pretty simple topological features of the nodes in a protein
network. Recently, however, more complex metrics have been introduced, which have
several advantages over the older ones. In particular, many of these sophisticated
parameters are useful because they recapitulate a larger amount of information with respect
to simpler ones. One of such parameter is the “graphlet degree signature” of a node, first
introduced by Milenković T. & Przulj N. (2008). To understand what is it, let us consider
figure 10.
Imagine that we want to study the local topology around the two colored nodes shown in
figure 10A. A possible way would be to count all the graphlets of a certain type which pass
through the nodes. Graphlets are small connected network subgraphs with a pre-

139

Protein Networks: Generation, Structural Analysis and Exploitation

determined number of nodes. In figure 10B, we reported all the possible graphlets with 2
nodes and 3 nodes, with the designation G0, G1 and G2 originally introduced by Pržulj. As
evident by figure 10C , node 1 is touched by 3, 3 and 1 G0, G1 and G2 graphlets respectively.
Node 2 is touched by 5, 5 and 2 G0, G1 and G2 graphlets respectively. You can check the
number of G0 and G1 graphlets on the left part of figure 10C, and the number of G2 graphlets
(triangles) on the right; these numbers are called G0, G1 and G2 graphlet degree of a node.
Thus, with respect to two- and three nodes graphlets, it is possible to define an ordered
vector of the type <g0, g1, g2>, which will describe for each node how many graphlets of any
possible type actually pass through the node. For node 1 and node 2, this vector assumes the
values of <3,3,1> and <5,5,2> respectively. The vector obtained considering all the 29
possible graphlets having from 2 to 5 nodes has been originally dubbed “graphlet degree
signature” or simply “signature” of a node.

140

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

Before going further, it is important to note the following:
1. the G0 degree is equivalent to the node degree we saw in the preceding paragraphs; in
this respect, the graphlet degree signature can be seen as a generalization of the node
degree, which is not limited to the count of only a single type of graphlet;
2. By considering the type and number of graphlet connected to a node, the graphlet
degree signature captures in a single metric both the degree of the node, the
neighborhood abundance and its topology, recapitulating in a single measure the
complementary aspects we introduced in the previous paragraphs.
Once defined in the way we have seen, the graphlet degree signature can be used to cluster
all the nodes of a network according to their similarity. We will not enter into the details of
the method, which is fully described elsewhere (Milenković T. & Przulj N. 2008); to our
purposes, it is enough to understand that nodes with a graphlet degree signature similar
above a certain threshold (which implies a similar centrality and a topologically equivalent
neighborhood) can be grouped together. The resulting groups, however, may contain nodes
which are quite far in the original network, so that nodes in the same cluster are in general
scattered all over the network. Mostly relevant to the biologist, it has been shown how these
clusters contain proteins of similar biological role and functioning (Milenković T. & Przulj
N. 2008). This means that, at least in principle, if one selects a node with known biological
features, it is possible to calculate its graphlet degree signature, search for nodes with a
similar signature and transpose the biological features to what has been found, without
considering the distance of the newly identified nodes from the starting point, as opposite to
what we have seen in the previous paragraph.

6. A brief review of successful applications
We will see at this point how the topological analysis of biological networks has been
already applied to achieve interesting results. Due to the limited space, we will restrict
ourselves to few examples; however, the literature describing successful applications of
network analysis in biology is growing at exponential rate, as evident by comparing the
papers produced yearly and indexed by Pubmed for “network biology”in 2000 (372) to the
corresponding figure for 2010 (2324).
A first, obvious application of topological network analysis consists in illuminating new
aspects of the cell biology, which are evident only when looking to the full puzzle
represented by a molecular net, instead then to the single pieces of it. The instruments used
for such an analysis are many; however, even the simplest topological descriptors we have
introduced in this chapter, such as the cliques, may be very useful.
To illustrate this point, let us refer initially to the classic work of Spirin and Mirny on the
yeast protein-protein interaction network (Spirin V. & Mirny LA. 2003). These two authors
were the first to describe the presence of densely connected modules in protein-protein
interaction network, i.e. neighborhoods whose internal connectivity is very high compared
to the average network connectivity. As we already know, in extreme cases – i.e. in case all
the neighborood’s components are fully connected – these protein groups are cliques. As
discovered by the aforementioned authors, cliques and very connected neighborhoods
represent molecular complexes and/or functional modules. Thanks to this fact, the authors
were able to identify a full wealth of new functional modules, including several previously

Protein Networks: Generation, Structural Analysis and Exploitation

141

unknown molecular machineries, such as an eight-member module of cyclin-dependent
kinases, cyclins and their inhibitors regulating the cell cycle, a six-member module of
proteins involved in bud emergence and polarity establishment and a six-member module
of CDCs, septins, and Ser/Thr protein kinases involved in mitotic control. From their
starting seminal work, which for the first time shifted the network analysis from single node
centrality to community of nodes, a deluge of research followed. This trend culminated in
several complex applications of clique analysis, such as a recent work which nicely
illustrated how the mitotic spindle functioning is regulated by a cascade of events which
involves cliques (i.e. molecular complexes) instead of single proteins (Chen TC. Et al., 2009).
With regard to more complex topological parameters, such as the graphlet degree signature
introduced in the previous paragraph, there are obviously fewer examples, given the fact
that they have been introduced much later. However, being refined instruments, the results
obtained by their systematic application are somehow superior in generality, and uncover
the real potency of the topological approach in molecular network analysis. To understand
this, is sufficient to read a recent paper by Milenkovic T. et al., 2010. The authors describe
how in a human protein-protein interaction network oncogenes do have a very similar
graphlet degree signature, which is different from that of genes unrelated to cancer, at a
point that they are able to use this signature to identify new oncogenes. If this finding will
be confirmed by others, we will be forced to admit that the detailed topology around a node
in a global protein-protein interaction map is important in determining the function of the
corresponding protein at least at the same level as its sequence and three-dimensional
structure – a somehow unexpected result, given the fact that protein-protein interaction
networks are only a very abstract map of all the interactions which have been observed,
without spatial and temporal resolution, and do not corresponds to any physical entity.
However, we want to conclude this paragraph by stressing the fact that, albeit this and
similar fundamental problems rest to be solved, and are matter of current and future
research in the field, we are seeing already the first applications of network analysis in
human therapy. In particular, although network science is still in its infancy, it is currently
shifting from a better understanding of why a given drug works or not to the identification
of new therapeutic interventions. As an example, consider the case of multi-drug therapy,
which is a very active field of research and experimental work, due to its high potential in
overcoming several obstacle to the effective pharmacological treatment of different
conditions. As opposed to the classical “magic bullet” pharmacological paradigm, aiming to
the ultra-specific targeting of a single protein, a new kind of approach to the design of a
therapy is emerging, which relies on simultaneously targeting several molecular processes.
The topological analysis of the molecular network underlying a specific disease is the only
way to rational implement such an approach, allowing the quest for modulators acting on
different network areas, so to attack different cellular pathways. This way to proceed was
recently validated by some groups, which could identify the right combination of drugs to
be used in a number of oncological conditions, such as incurable pancreatic adenocarcinoma
(Azmi AS. Et al., 2010), as well as head and neck chemoresistant cancer (Ratushny V. et al.,
2009).
From the point of view of the network topology, the approaches described in these papers
can be seen as the targeting of control hubs within neighborhoods with quite distinct
compositions and cellular functions (i.e. separated neighborhoods enriched in proteins with
different functional annotation), a practical strategy which relies on the concepts discussed
previously in this chapter and which wait to be extended to several other cases.

7. Conclusion: A concept-map for the analysis of network topology
Having listed some few examples, we would like to recall to the attention of the reader those
elements which allow a successful analysis: a proper selection of the data set to start with, a
correct identification of the rules used to build the network (i.e. the type of network to be
analyzed), few general assumptions on the relationships between the topology and the
biological properties of the proteins to be found, and a correctly chosen null-hypothesis for
the minimization of false positives (which, if possible, should also take into account bias and
errors).
Let us discuss briefly the first point, i.e. the selection of a proper data set to derive the nodes
of the network. This step is crucially influenced by the scope of the network. For example, if
the aim is to find potential drug targets for a given condition, a literature-derived dataset,
including all the proteins known to be related to a certain disease – irrespectively of the type
of relation they have with the studied condition - might be useful. A protein expression data
set, containing data on differential protein expression, would be equally useful. On the
contrary, taking into account a complete protein-protein interaction data set may be both
misleading – given the fact that there is no guarantee that the proteins contained in it are
expressed in the selected condition – and useless, because this type of database lacks
information on those proteins which have strong activity and expression in the selected
condition, but do not have any identified molecular partner.
As for the second point, usually people select the type of network (and thus the node linking
rule) they want to build at the very first step – i.e., they use protein interaction databases to
build protein-protein interaction networks, expression databases for co-expression networks
and so on. However, there are certain cases were this passage is not automatic. For example,
if the data source for the node list is the scientific literature, instead of building a literature
co-occurrence network one can derive the linking rule from a different source, like a
microarray experiment database. By combining a literature-derived list of nodes with
microarray information for linking them, one would obtain a network, whose nodes are
selected on the basis of a specific scientific topic, and are bound by co-expression, without
the need to perform an actual experiment in the condition of interest.
As for the third point, it is true that, in general, the topology of a node is correlated to the
relevance of the role that the corresponding protein plays in the particular condition the
network refers to. However, one has to recall that:
1. The meaning of “topologically relevant proteins” varies with the type of network – for
example, hubs in co-expression networks are usually housekeeping proteins, while in
protein-protein interaction networks they may be core constituent of molecular
complexes;
2. the specific meaning varies also with the network dimension – so that in a network
including the full yeast proteome, topologically prominent proteins are heterogeneous
in function, while in a network made of proteins involved in apoptosis the hubs are key
apoptosis regulators;
3. obviously protein prioritization is affected by the particular topological quantity one is
measuring –a protein may be an hub, yet may have no clique including it;
4. the relevance of a protein for the cell may be in gross contrast with what is perceived as
relevant by the investigator – housekeeping proteins are very relevant to the
functioning of the cell, but not so to someone wanting to find new drug targets.

Protein Networks: Generation, Structural Analysis and Exploitation

143

Finally, coming to the forth point, we want to stress here that control models to be used for
underpinning significant topological properties should vary, depending on the topological
quantity under study. Thus, to get a control network for testing the relevance of some
topological characteristic of a certain group of node, one may compare the results obtained
on the actual network with those obtained in:
a. a random network, i.e. a network made of the same number of nodes and edges, with
fully random connection between the nodes- this is enough to test for the global
distribution of topological quantities, such as the degree distribution or the existence of
statistically relevant neighborhoods;
b. a degree-preserving random network, i.e. a network made of the same number of nodes
and edges, with the degree of each node preserved, but a completely different wiring –
this is the proper control, when one want to test the association between some
topological parameter and a specific biological attribute, which depends on the
particular nodes considered;
c. a set of random network (degree preserving type or not) – this is the proper control,
when one want to test the probability of the emergence of the observed topology in a
network

After these considerations, we will conclude this chapter by outlining a general conceptmap, reported in figure 11, which we feel can be useful in analyzing the topology of protein
networks. This map should be regarded as a contribution to avoid common
misinterpretations of the meaning of topological parameters in different contexts, not as an
all-inclusive description of the possible applications and types of protein networks.

1. Introduction
The availability of over 1500 completely sequenced and annotated prokaryotic genomes offers
a variety of comparative and predictive approaches on genome-scale. The results of such
analyses strongly rely on the quality of the employed data and the computational strategy
of their interpretation. Today, comparative genomics allows for the quick and accurate
assignment of genes and often their corresponding functions. The resulting list of classiﬁed
genes provides information about the overall genomic arrangement, of metabolic capabilities,
general and unique cellular functions, however, almost nothing about the underlying complex
regulatory networks. Transcriptional regulation of gene expression is a central part of these
networks in all organisms. It determines the actual RNA, protein and as a consequence
metabolite composition of a cell. Moreover, it allows cells to adapt these parameters in
response to changing environmental conditions. An integral part of transcriptional regulation
is the speciﬁc interaction of transcription factors (TFs) with their corresponding DNA targets,
the transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) or motifs. Recent advances in extensive data
mining using various high-throughput techniques provided ﬁrst insights into the complex
regulatory networks and their interconnections. However, the computational prediction of
regulatory interactions in the promoter regions of identiﬁed genes remains to be difﬁcult.
Consequently, there is a high demand for the in silico identiﬁcation and analysis of involved
regulatory DNA sequences and the development of software tools for the accurate prediction
of TFBSs.
In this chapter we focus on methods for the prediction of TFBSs in whole prokaryotic
genomes (regulons). Although, many studies were sucessfully performed in eukaryotes they
are often not transferable to the special features of bacterial gene regulation. In particular
the prokaryotic genome organization concerning clusters of co-transcribed polycistronic
genes, the lack of introns and the shortness of promoter sequences necessitates adapted
computational approaches. Besides the genomic structure there are also differences in
the regulatory control logic. Prokaryotic promoters often possess one or few regulatory
interactions while the repertoire of regulators consists of only a couple of global TFs but
many local TFs (Price et al., 2008). On the other hand, eukaryotic promoters and enhancers
involve the concerted binding of multiple regulators, so called cis-regulatory modules (CRMs)
or composite elements (Loo & Marynen, 2009). Many excellent reviews in the ﬁeld prokaryotic
gene regulation were recently published with focus on the broad spectrum of approaches
for the experimental and theoretical reconstruction of gene regulatory networks and their

interspecies transfer (Baumbach, 2010; Rodionov, 2007; van Hijum et al., 2009; Zhou & Yang,
2006). Here, we focus on practical aspects how to detect new members of a regulon for genes
or genomes of interest. We will summarize useful bioinformatics databases, methods and
algorithms available for unraveling bacterial gene regulatory networks from whole genome
sequences. Finally, we want to indicate the limitations and technical problems of such
approaches and give a survey on recent improvements in this ﬁeld.

2. Strategies for the prediction of transcripion factor binding sites
Basically, today exist at least two general approaches to recognize regulatory sequence
patterns.
One challenging approach called pattern discovery relies on a statistical
overrepresentation of DNA sequence motifs present in promoters of structurally and
funktionally related or co-regulated genes. In that case it is a de-novo prediction where the
binding site and the corresponding regulator are unknown. The list of investigated genes
can be derived from clusters of co-expressed genes available in microarray experiments,
from ChIP-on-chip experiments or from orthologous genes of related organisms. In the
latter case this method is called phylogenetic footprinting (McCue et al., 2001). Pattern
discovery algorithms are top-down approaches that use various learning principles with
different degrees of performance (Sandve et al., 2007; Su et al., 2010; Tompa et al., 2005). The
advantage of this method is the detection of potential regulatory DNA sequences even if there
is little known about the corresponding regulation. A recent study in prokaryotes appling a
pattern discovery approach revealed that the predicted patterns matched up to 81% of known
individual TFBSs (Zhang et al., 2009). However, this approach has limitted value in getting a
clue about what speciﬁc regulator is involved in a predicted TFBS.
An alternative approach on which we focus in this chapter is called pattern matching. It
makes use of prior knowledge in form of a predetermined pattern that can be assigned to a
speciﬁc regulator. The pattern is usually build based on a proﬁle of known TFBSs for which
experimental evidence is available (Fig. 1 A). Using this set of DNA sequences a probabilistic
model describing the pattern degeneracy is constructed. Application of the model on a
given sequence results in a score for the likelihood that the investigated sequence belongs
to the same sequence family. The application of pattern matching involves the availability
of a reliable training set of TFBSs. For that purpose, several specalized databases provide
collections and patterns of prokaryotic TBFSs supplemented with various related information
like promoter and operon structures. A limited list of important data sources is shown in
table 1.
In the following examples a data set of 40 experimentally proven TFBSs from the anaerobic
regulator Anr of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is used (Trunk et al., 2010). There are different
ways of pattern representation. Traditionally, the usage of IUPAC code for base ambiguities
is a straightforward way to describe a binding motif (NC-IUB, 1985). In this approach,
combinations of certain bases are assigned to an extended alphabet of speciﬁc letters (Fig. 1 B).
IUPAC code can be easily converted into a regular expression (Fig. 1 C). A regular expression
is a formal language for pattern matching, that can be used to scan for ambiguous IUPAC
strings in order to predict new TFBSs (Betel & Hogue, 2002). (Fig. 1 B). Allthough the IUPAC
letter code is very concise and still widely used among biologists it does not describe a proper
weighting of bases. Additionally, the majority rules how to generate a consensus sequences
are to some extent arbitrary (Day & McMorris, 1992). However, in the case that the training
set consists of only a few sequences the usage of IUPAC code can still make sense.

A more accurate description of a binding pattern is achieved by probabilistic models like a
frequency matrix (or alignment matrix) (Staden, 1984). Instead of considering only the most
common bases at each position a matrix comprises the frequencies for each nucleotide at each
position (Fig. 1 D). Based on frequency matrices many models for the calculation of weights
were proposed. Such a model is broadly called position weight matrix (PWM) or position
speciﬁc scoring matrix (PSSM). PWMs can be considered as simpliﬁed proﬁle hidden Markov
models (HMM) that do not allow insertion and deletion states (Durbin et al., 1998). Formally,
a PWM is an array M of weights w where each column corresponds to the position of the TFBS
motif of the length l and each row represents the letter of the sequence alphabet A. In case of
DNA A ∈ { A, C, G, T } (equation 1).

Many very related examples for the calculation of individual weights were proposed in the
literaure (Berg & von Hippel, 1987; Fickett, 1996; Schneider et al., 1986; Staden, 1984; Stormo,
2000). The information theoretical approach and modiﬁcations of it ((Schneider et al., 1986))
are widely used and some of the most successful methods for both the modeling and the
prediction of potential TFBSs. Information is a measure of uncertainty which means that

152

a highly conserved position with the exclusive occurence of one speciﬁc nucleotide gets
the highest information value of 2 bits. In other words there is a maximum certainty of
ﬁnding this nucleotide at this position. In contrast, an information value of 0 bits represents
a highly degenerated position and the highest uncertainty of ﬁnding a speciﬁc nucleotide.
The information vector R(l ) represents the total information content of a proﬁle of aligned
sequences at the position l with f (b, l ) indicating the frequency of the base b at position l.
R(l ) = 2 +

T

∑

b= A

f (b, l ) log2 f (b, l )

(2)

An information PWM m(b, l ) is generated by multiplying the base frequencies f (b, l ) with the
total information content R(l ) (Fig. 1 E).
m(b, l ) = f (b, l ) · R(l )

(3)

For pattern matching applications a PWM is used by summing up the corresponding
weights of a candidate sequence to a score. Afterwards, these scores are compared to a
predeﬁned cut-off (or threshold) to ﬁlter out potential predictions. The derived score is
often correlated to the binding afﬁnity of a TF thus the information score can be interpreted
as an rough estimate to the speciﬁc bindung energy. However, this is only possible under
the simplifying assumption that each position of a pattern contributes independently to the
TF-TFBS interaction. This additivity assumption is controversially discussed but is was shown
that it is in fact a reasonable approximation (Benos et al., 2002). The graphical representation
of an information PWM is called sequence logo (Schneider & Stephens, 1990). In a sequence
logo each PWM weight is equivalent to the individual letter size so the total height of the stack
of letters represents the information content R(l ) at this position. Sequence logos allow an
illustrative visualization of the sequence conservation and binding preference of a regulator
(Fig. 1 F).

3. Statistical signiﬁcance of pattern matching
Regulatory sequences are commonly short (usually 6-18 bp), the sample size of experimentally
proven sites is often limited and in many cases the observed level of sequence conservation
is low. Consequently, the genome-wide statistically occurance frequency of derived patterns
is often unrealistically high. In such cases, searches generally generate increasing numbers of
false-predictions the lower the threshold score is set. This is demonstrated in Fig. 2 showing
the score distributions of true and false predictions of a genome wide search in P. aeruginosa
using the PWM of the Anr regulator (Fig. 1 E). In the shown example matches in coding
regions were considered as false-predictions (false-positives) and matches that are part of the
training set were naturally ranked as true-predictions (true-positives). Score distributions are
also important indicators to evaluate the predictive capacity of a PWM (Medina-Rivera et al.,
2011).
In order to improve the predictive power of pattern matching, commonly a cut-off score is
set in a way, that improves the ratio of true- and false-predictions. However, thereby the
total number of hits will still contain to some extent false-positives while some true matches
become lost (false-negatives). From this it follows that matches of TFBS predictions can not be
classiﬁed in a binary manner like a dignostic test, since true-positives and false-positives are
always coexisting. Alternatively, they can be grouped into a classiﬁcation schema consisting

Thus, setting a cut-off score can be considered as important decision-making process. Instead
of setting an arbitrary cut-off value it is possible to determine an optimized threshold. For
that purpose, a number of statistical performance measurements for binary classiﬁcation are
available. Sensitivity Sn (or true-positive rate) measures the proportion of positive matches
which are correctly identiﬁed at a given cut-off score c. Hereby, the positive matches include
both the number of true-positives TP and false-negatives FN.

Similarly, speciﬁcity Sp (or true-negative rate) measures the proportion of correctly identiﬁed
negative matches at a given cut-off score c where the amount of negative matches is the sum
of true-negatives TN and false-positive FP.

This deﬁnition involves that the sensitivity and speciﬁcity plots as a function of the cut-off
show opposite behaviour which results in an increase of speciﬁcity (get less false-positives)
at the cost of sensitivity (ﬁnd less true-positives) and vice versa (Fig. 4 A). A receiver
operating characteristics (ROC) curve summarizes the classiﬁcation performance in a plot of
sensitivity versus (1-speciﬁcity). ROC curves are fundamental tools for the evaluation of the
classiﬁcation models. An optimal ROC curve would cross the upper left corner or coordinate
(0,1) representing 100% sensitivity and speciﬁcity whereas a random guess would produce a
point along the diagonal line (Fig. 4 A). Thus, the diagonal line divides the ROC space: points
above the digonal represent good classiﬁcation results, points below the line indicate poor
results (Fawcett, 2004).

An alternative way to optimize the performance of pattern matching and to produce
stastistically signiﬁcant results is the calculation of a p-value. A p-value depicts the likelihood
to ﬁnd a score that is as least as good by change. P-values can be either determined by
simulation or estimated via a compound importance sampling approach (Oberto, 2010).
Finally, appropriate thresholds for pattern searches are determined as a tradeoff between
sensitivity and speciﬁcity to maximize both values. Despite optimized cut-off values this
approach can results in a poor sensitivity and a loss of 40-60% of known functional sites
(Benítez-Bellón et al., 2002). In addition, the fact that false-predictions commonly exeeds
true-predictions by several orders of magnitude (Fig. 2 B) was called ’futility theorem’
(Wasserman & Sandelin, 2004). Fortunately, there are many sophisticated approaches to
overcome this problem in a reasonable way (see section 4).

4. Improvements to increase the accuracy of TFBS predictions
4.1 Modiﬁcations of the score

In several studies the information score was modiﬁed in different ways. One of the most
critical points of equation 2 is that it postulates an equal nucleotide distribtuion of the target
genome which is the case e.g. for Escherichia coli with a GC content of 51.8%. For this reason,

156

the calculation of the information content of motifs in genomes with highly biased nucleotide
composition is likely to be over- or underestimated. A more generalized form that considers
the background frequencies Pb is given in equation 6.
R(l ) = −

T

∑

b= A

f (b, l ) log2

f (b, l )
Pb

(6)

This new term turned out to be the relative entropy or Kullback-Leibler distance (Stormo,
2000). An other promising approach deals with biased genome as a discrete channel of noise to
discriminate a motif from its background (Schreiber & Brown, 2002). However, it was recently
demonstrated, that the unmodiﬁed information score performs on average better than other
alternatives (Erill & O’Neill, 2009). One reason might be, that binding sites shift towards the
genome skew in a co-evolutionary process between TFs and its corresponding TFBSs.
Other modiﬁcations concern the way the score is computationally calculated. Since the
information vector usually peeks at certain well conserved positions it is possible to get
overestimated matches by forming the overall sum. For that purpose, it is useful to deﬁne
a core region consisting of the highly conserved positions. Using this approach it is possible
to realize the computation of the score in two steps. Potential matches have to pass ﬁrst the
core cut-off before they are evaluated by the overall cut-off score (Münch et al., 2005; Quandt
et al., 1995).
Finally, it is possible to enhance the accuracy by combining multiple (independent) criterions.
Apart from the pure sequence information, DNA exhibits distinct structural properties caused
by interactions from neighboring nucleotides. This includes for example DNA curvature,
ﬂexibility and stability, amongst others. Structural DNA features are available as di- and
trinucleotide scale values assigning a particular value to each possible nucleotide combination
(Baldi & BaisnÃ©e, 2000). These values are derived from empirical measurements or
theoretical approaches. The calculation of structural features within a DNA sequence stretch
is usually performed by summing up and averaging the corresponding di- or trinucleotide
scales. Prokaryotic promoters usually exhibit distinct structural features which imply that
these DNA sequences are more curved and less ﬂexible in comparision to coding regions.
This feature is necessary in order to enable the melting of the DNA strands for the onset of
transcription. In most bacterial promoters structural peaks are present around the position
-40 upstream of the transcriptional start point (Pedersen et al., 2000). Structural features can
provide distinct scores independent from PWM based sequence similarity scores. Recently,
pattern matching was combined with a binding site model that was trained using 12 different
structural properties (Meysman et al., 2011). In this approach, based on conditional random
ﬁelds, it was shown, that the classiﬁcation of matches was signiﬁcantly improved. In a similar
way, structural and chemical features of DNA decreased the number of false-positives in a
supervised learning approach (Bauer et al., 2010).
4.2 Positional preference of TFBSs

Prokaryotic genomes usually consist of 6-14% non-coding DNA (Rogozin et al., 2002). In
contrast to eukaryotes, the evolvement of non-coding regions appears to be determined
primarily by the selective pressure to minimize the amount of non-functional DNA, while
maintaining the essential TFBSs. Additionally, it was demonstrated in Escherichia coli, that
many PWMs show a strong preference for matches in non-coding regions (Robison et al.,
1998). Figure 5 A shows the distance of 1741 genomic TFBSs relative to the translational
start site of the target gene. Only 3.6% of all TFBSs are located after the start codon within

the coding region. However, the largest amount of TFBSs is accumulated directly upstream.
This is also demonstrated in the cumulative percentage of TFBSs against the distance to the
translational start (Fig. 5 B). According to this result, a total of 75.3% and 87.9% of all TFBSs
are located 200bp and 300bp upstream, respectively. Thus, prokaryotic promoters are usually
short and it is reasonable to constrain searches to non-coding regions with a limit of a few
hundred bp upstream to the translational start.

4.3 Phylogenetic conservation of regulatory interactions

The large number of sequenced bacterial genomes offers comparative genomics approaches
to predict and to analyze regulatory interactions. Similar to phylogenetic footprinting, highly
conserved matches in promoter regions of paralogous genes are more likely to be functional
targets than non-conserved matches (McCue et al., 2001). This is particulary important for
the interspecies transfer of gene regulatory networks (Babu et al., 2006; Baumbach, 2010) but
also for the scanning of new regulon members (Pérez et al., 2007). The utilization of pattern
matching methods in combination with phylogenetic conservation is also called regulog
analysis (Alkema et al., 2004). During a regulog analysis the relativ conservation score RCS is
deﬁned by the fraction of orthologs, that share the same potential TFBS.
RCS =

orthologsobserved
orthologsexpected

(7)

In the ﬁrst step of this and related approaches, the orthologous regulators and the
corresponding target gene set are determined. This is often realized by bi-directional best
BLAST hits (BBH) (Mushegian & Koonin, 1996). In the second step, conserved TFBSs are
extracted via pattern matching or pattern discovery approaches. Predicted TFBSs with
phylogenetic conservation can also be used to extend or to build new PWMs. Huge
datasets based on phylogenetic reconstruction were generated in various groups of bacteria
(Baumbach et al., 2009; Novichkov et al., 2010; Pérez et al., 2007). Further investigetion of
regulon evolution revealed the availability of a core set of genes that is widely conserved

across related species and a variable set of target genes reﬂecting the degree of specialization
(Browne et al., 2010; Dufour et al., 2010). However, it was shown, that the outlined approach is
commonly only feasible between closely related clades which is due to the fact that TFs evolve
rapidly and independently of their target genes (Babu et al., 2006). Morover, orthologous
TFs in bacteria often have different functions and regulate different sets of genes (Price et al.,
2007). In summary, a high RCS value for a TFBS match represents an independent score
for the validation for a real functional targets while a low RCS does not necessarily rule
out false-positive matches. The phylogenetic conservation approach represents a powerful
approach to predict gene regulatory networks in highly related organisms and to get insights
into the evolution of regulons.

5. Conclusion and outlook
In summary the genome-wide recognition of DNA patterns by computational methods is still
a challanging task. However, major improvements in this ﬁeld allow for reliable predictions in
many cases. Especially the rising number of sequenced bacterial genomes in combination with
data from high-throughput technologies offers many posibilities for the development of more
sophisticated methods in comparative genomics approaches. Nevertheless, computational
methods for TFBSs prediction can not replace wet-lab experiments but they can help to ﬁnd
new hypotheses that can be veriﬁed in an iterative process.

Mining Host-Pathogen Interactions
Dmitry Korkin, Thanh Thieu, Sneha Joshi and Samantha Warren

1. Introduction
Infections are caused by a vast variety of pathogenic agents including viruses, bacteria,
fungi, protozoa, multicellular parasites, and even proteins (Anderson and May 1979;
Morse 1995; Bartlett 1997; Mandell and Townsend 1998) that target host organisms from
virtually all kingdoms of life (Daszak, Cunningham et al. 2000; Williams, Yuill et al. 2002).
Infectious diseases in humans account for 170 thousand deaths in the United States and
14,7 million deaths world-wide (2004; Rossi and Walker 2005). “Neglected diseases”, a
group of tropical diseases that are spread among the poorest segment of the world’s
population, account for a large portion of human infections (Ayoola 1987; Trouiller,
Olliaro et al. 2002). With the reluctance of the pharmaceutical industry to invest in the
development of drugs for neglected diseases, there is an increasing pressure on the
scientific community in academia and non-profit organizations to obtain a fast and
inexpensive cure (Trouiller, Torreele et al. 2001; Maurer, Rai et al. 2004; Fehr, Thurmann et
al. 2006). In addition to human infections, infections in plant and animals have a
multibillion dollar economic impact each year (Bowers, Bailey et al. 2001; Whitby 2001).
Expanding the studies to the whole animal kingdom allows scientists to study the hostpathogen evolution of virulence mechanisms that are common among plant and animals,
such as type III secretion system (T3SS), an elaborate protein-delivery system (Espinosa
and Alfano 2004; Abramovitch, Anderson et al. 2006). Moreover, studying interactions
between pathogens and simpler model organisms, such as drosophila, has led to
important findings in mammalian systems and is critical for understanding human
infections (Cherry and Silverman 2006). Recently another threat has come to scientists’
attention: the potential use of some pathogens as bioweapons (Whitby 2001; Moran, Talan
et al. 2008). The attacks can target population directly, or they can target strategic
resources such as the world’s most consumed crops. Studying HPIs may provide critical
knowledge for the development of infection diagnosis and treatment for disaster planning
in case of a bioterrorism event.
A pathogen causing an infectious disease generally exhibits extensive interactions with the
host (Munter, Way et al. 2006). These complex crosstalks between a host and a pathogen
may assist the pathogen in successfully invading the host organism, breaching its immune
defence, as well as replicating and persisting within the organism. Systematic determination
and analysis of HPIs is a challenging task from both experimental and computational
approaches, and is critically dependent on the previously obtained knowledge about these
interactions. The molecular mechanisms of host-pathogen interactions (HPIs) include

164

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

interactions between proteins, nucleotide sequences, and small ligands (Lengeling, Pfeffer et
al. 2001; Kahn, Fu et al. 2002; Stebbins 2005; Forst 2006). The interactions between the
pathogen and host proteins are one of the most important and therefore widely studied
group of HPIs (Stebbins 2005). During the last decade, an increasing amount of experimental
data on virulence factors, their structures, and their functions has become available
(Sansonetti 2002; Stebbins 2005). The first steps towards large-scale systematic determination
and analysis of molecular HPIs have recently emerged for important pathogens (Shapira,
Gat-Viks et al. 2009; Dyer, Neff et al. 2010). Recent progress in data mining and
bioinformatics allows scientists to accurately predict novel protein-protein interactions,
structurally characterize individual proteins and protein complexes, and predict protein
functions on a scale of an entire proteome (Thornton 2001; Russell, Alber et al. 2004;
Shoemaker and Panchenko 2007). Unfortunately, there have been only a handful of methods
designed to address the protein interactions between pathogenic agents and their hosts
(Cherkasov and Jones 2004; Davis, Barkan et al. 2007; Dyer, Murali et al. 2007; Lee, Chan et
al. 2008; Evans, Dampier et al. 2009; Tyagi, Krishnadev et al. 2009; Doolittle and Gomez
2011). As it is the case for many bioinformatics areas, collecting HPI data into a centralized
repository is instrumental in developing accurate predictive methods. Recently, several such
HPI repositories have been introduced, some are manually curated, while others are reliant
on the existing databases (Winnenburg, Urban et al. 2008; Driscoll, Dyer et al. 2009; Kumar
and Nanduri 2010). While this is a promising first step towards a large-scale HPI data
collection, one of the largest and most comprehensive sources of experimentally verified
HPI data remains largely underexplored: PubMed, a database of peer-reviewed biomedical
literature, which includes abstracts of more than 20 million research papers and books
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/). Unfortunately, the comprehensive manual
identification and data extraction of the abstracts containing HPI information from PubMed
is not feasible due to the size of PubMed. Furthermore, no informatics approach currently
available to do this automatically.
In this chapter, we discuss several possible solutions to the problem of automated HPI data
collection from the publicly available literature. The chapter is organized as follows. First,
we describe some of the popular HPI databases that are currently available publicly. Second,
we discuss the state-of-the-art approaches to a related problem of mining general proteinprotein interactions from the literature. Third, we propose three approaches to mine HPIs
and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these approaches. In conclusion, we
discuss the future steps in the area of HPI text mining by highlighting factors that are critical
for its successful development.

2. Host-pathogen interaction databases
During the last several years, a number of resources collecting HPI data have emerged
(Snyder, Kampanya et al. 2007; Winnenburg, Urban et al. 2008; Driscoll, Dyer et al. 2009;
Kumar and Nanduri 2010). Many resources rely on the automated post-processing of the
large-scale databases for general protein-protein interactions, while some other obtain the
HPI data by manually curating the biomedical literature. Often the resources focus on the
human-pathogen interactions. Next, we will briefly describe some of the popular databases
that include HPI data.
HPIDB - Host-Pathogen Interaction DataBase. One of the most recent HPI database,
HPIDB (Kumar and Nanduri 2010) integrates the information from other HPI database, PIG

Mining Host-Pathogen Interactions

165

(Driscoll, Dyer et al. 2009), and more general protein-protein interaction databases, BIND
(Gilbert 2005), GeneRIF(Mitchell, Aronson et al. 2003; Pruitt, Tatusova et al. 2003), IntAct
(Aranda, Achuthan et al. 2010), MINT (Zanzoni, Montecchi-Palazzi et al. 2002), and
Reactome (Matthews, Gopinath et al. 2009). Currently, the database has 22,841 proteinprotein interactions between 49 host and 319 pathogen species (Kumar and Nanduri 2010).
HPIDB is searchable via a keyword search, a BLAST search, or a homologous HPI search.
For each query, the following output information is obtained: UniProt accession numbers of
both host and pathogen proteins, host and pathogen names, detection method, author name,
PubMed publication ID (PMID), interaction type, source database, and comments. The
homologous HPI search option allows the user to do one or both of the following: search for
a set of homologous host proteins, and search for a set of homologous pathogen proteins.
PATRIC – PAThosystems Resource Integration Center. PATRIC is a resource that
integrates genomics, proteomics, and interactomics data on a comprehensive set of bacterial
species as well as a set of data mining and comparative genomics tools (Snyder, Kampanya
et al. 2007; Sullivan, Gabbard et al. 2010). The human-pathogen interaction data for 30
bacterial pathogens are also a part of the resource. Similar to HPIDB, the data are extracted
and post-processed from a number of general protein-protein interaction databases
including BIND (Gilbert 2005), DIP (Xenarios, Fernandez et al. 2001), IntAct (Aranda,
Achuthan et al. 2010), and MINT (Zanzoni, Montecchi-Palazzi et al. 2002). With PATRIC a
user selects a pathogen from the home page. The search can be refined by selecting specific
interaction types (e.g., “direct interaction”, “colocalization”), detection methods (e.g.,
“coimmunoprecipitation”, “two hybrid”), or source databases. The results can be visualized
as a network of interacting proteins with the colour nodes representing different species and
weighted edges representing the number of independent experimental sources supporting
the interaction. The Pathogen Interaction Gateway (PIG) is a part of PATRIC that is focused
on collecting and analysing exclusively the protein-protein human-pathogen interactions
and the corresponding interaction networks (Driscoll, Dyer et al. 2009). The PIG web
interface allows mining the data using two query types: the BLAST search and text keyword
search. PIG also has a utility that allows the user to visualize the network of protein-protein
HPIs followed by the network comparison between the HPI networks extracted for two
different pathogen genes.
PHI-base – the Pathogen-Host Interaction dataBASE. PHI-base collects information on
experimentally verified pathogenicity, virulence and effector genes from bacterial, fungal,
and Oomycete pathogens and includes a variety of infected hosts from plants, mammals,
fungus, and insects (Winnenburg, Urban et al. 2008). All database entries are manually
curated and are supported by experimental evidence and literature citations. The current
version has a total of 1,065 gene entries participating in 1,335 interactions between 97
pathogens and 76 hosts, supported by 720 literature references. The interaction between a
host and pathogen organism is considered in this database in a more general sense and often
is not associated with any physical interaction between the host and pathogen proteins.
Using the PHI-base web interface, a user can do either a simple quick search or an advanced
search, where the user selects one or many of the following search terms: gene, disease
(caused by pathogen), host, pathogen, anti-infective, phenotype, and experimental evidence.
The search output is a list of interactions and their details including PHI-base accession
number, gene name, EMBL accession number, phenotype of the mutant, pathogen species,
disease name, and experimental host. The user can also obtain additional information on
nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the pathogen gene, experimental evidence of the

166

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

interaction, gene ontology (pathogenesis, molecular function, and biological process), and a
publication reference.

3. Current approaches for mining protein-protein interactions
Rapid growth of published biomedical research has resulted in the development of a
number of methods for biomedical literature mining over the last decade (Krallinger and
Valencia 2005; Rodriguez-Esteban 2009). The methods dealing with the biomolecular
information can be generally divided into three categories based on the domain of
biomedical knowledge they target: (i) automated protein or gene name identification in a
text (Mika and Rost 2004; Seki and Mostafa 2005; Tanabe, Xie et al. 2005), (ii) literature-based
functional annotation of genes and proteins (Chiang and Yu 2003; Jaeger, Gaudan et al.
2008), and (iii) extracting the information on the relationships between biological molecules,
such as proteins and RNAs, or genes (Hu, Narayanaswamy et al. 2005; Shatkay, Hˆglund et
al. 2007; Lee, Yi et al. 2008). The relationships detected by the third group of methods range
from a co-occurrence of the genes and proteins in a text (Hoffmann and Valencia 2005) to
detecting the protein-protein interactions (PPIs) (Blaschke and Valencia 2001; Marcotte,
Xenarios et al. 2001; Donaldson, Martin et al. 2003) and identification of signal transduction
networks and metabolic pathways (Friedman, Kra et al. 2001; Hoffmann, Krallinger et al.
2005; Santos and Eggle 2005). Being a special case of protein-protein interactions, HPIs could
directly benefit from the advancements of the currently existing text mining methods.
Extraction of protein-protein interactions from the text has been one of the three main tasks
for the recent BioCreAtIvE (Critical Assessment of Information Extraction systems in
Biology) challenges, a community-wide effort for evaluating biological text mining and
information retrieval systems (Hirschman, Yeh et al. 2005; Krallinger, Leitner et al. 2008).
Three subtasks have been specified: (i) detection of protein-protein interactions relevant
documents (interaction article subtask, IAS), (ii) identification of sentences with proteinprotein interactions (interaction sentences subtask, ISS), and (iii) identification of interacting
protein pairs (interaction pair subtask, IPS). A relevant problem, the protein interaction
method subtask (IMS), is concerned with identification of the type of experimental data
used to determine an interaction. Approaches that address these subtasks vary from
supervised machine learning classifiers, to address the first subtask, to statistical language
processing and grammar-based methods to address the second and third subtasks.
A simple approach to extract protein-protein interactions is to determine the co-existence of
proteins in the same sentence (Stephens, Palakal et al. 2001; Hoffmann and Valencia 2005).
However, this approach is insufficient to handle structured information of biomedical
sentences. Therefore, pattern matching methods have been proposed that rely on either
manually defined patterns (Leroy and Chen 2002; Corney, Buxton et al. 2004) or patterns
that are automatically generated using dynamic programming (Huang, Zhu et al. 2004; Hao,
Zhu et al. 2005). Another popular group of methods employs the natural language
processing parsers. A basic approach, called shallow parsing, decomposes sentences into
non-overlapping fragments and chunks, and defines the dependencies between the chunks
without extracting their internal structure (Thomas, Milward et al. 2000; Leroy, Chen et al.
2003). Many shallow parsing approaches employ finite-state automata to recognize the
interaction relationships between proteins or genes (Thomas, Milward et al. 2000; Leroy,
Chen et al. 2003). One of the most prominent approaches relies on the deep parsing

Mining Host-Pathogen Interactions

167

techniques, where the entire structure of a sentence is extracted (Park, Kim et al. 2001; Ding,
Berleant et al. 2003; Daraselia, Yuryev et al. 2004; Pyysalo, Ginter et al. 2004; Kim, Shin et al.
2008; Miyao, Sagae et al. 2009). Many deep parsing approaches have successfully employed
link grammars (Sleator and Temperley 1995), context-free grammars that rely on a
dictionary of rules (linking requirements) to connect, or “link”, pairs of related words
(Ahmed, Chidambaram et al. 2005; Seoud, Youssef et al. 2008; Yang, Lin et al. 2009).
Each of the above methods, while directly addressing the second and the third subtasks, can
also solve the abstract classification problem from the first subtask, based on whether or not
the method is able to extract any protein-protein interactions. The accuracy of such
classification, however, depends on the accuracy of a more difficult subtask of proteinprotein interaction extraction. Thus, several methods have been developed to directly
address the problem of binary classification of protein-protein interaction relevant
publications (Marcotte, Xenarios et al. 2001; Calli 2009; Kolchinsky, Abi-Haidar et al. 2010).
The methods primarily rely on supervised and unsupervised feature-based classification
techniques. Recently, the first method for classification of HPI-relevant documents has been
introduced, which employs a Support Vector Machines (SVM) supervised classifier (Yin, Xu
et al. 2010).

4. New approaches to detection and mining host-pathogen interactions from
biomedical abstracts
HPI literature mining is related to a general problem of protein-protein interaction literature
mining. However, the additional requirement that the interaction occurs exclusively
between the host and pathogen proteins makes the task more challenging. The accuracy
of an HPI mining method will depend on additional factors, such as its ability to correctly
assign a host or pathogen organism to the interacting protein. Similar to the way
the BioCreAtIvE initiative defines three types of protein-protein interaction mining
problems (Hirschman, Yeh et al. 2005), the problem of HPI mining can be split into three
specific tasks:
HPI Mining Task 1: Given a biomedical publication (a paper or an abstract), determine
whether or not it contains information on HPIs.
HPI Mining Task 2: Given a biomedical publication containing HPI information, determine
specific sentences that contain this information.
HPI Mining Task 3: Given a biomedical publication that contain HPI information, determine
specific pairs of host and pathogen proteins participating in the interactions and the
corresponding organisms.
The first task can be formulated as a standard classification problem, which is often
addressed by machine learning methods and for which a number of the method assessment
protocols have been developed. Here we rely on the following five basic measures. The first
measure, accuracy, is calculated as f AC   N TP  N TN  / N , where NTP and NTN are the number
of true positives and negatives, correspondingly, and N is the number of classified
interfaces. The other two related measures, precision and recall, are calculated as
f PR  N TP /  NTP  N FP  and f RE  N TP /  N TP  N FN  , correspondingly, where NFP and NFN are
the number of false positives and negatives. F-score is calculated as F  2

is

as

. Similarly, performance on the last

task can be easily assessed based on the available information about the host and pathogen
proteins and their respective organisms. Specifically, we use four different measures. The
first two measures, fORG and fPRT, address the accuracy of detecting the pairs of interacting
host and pathogen organisms as well as their proteins. Each measure is calculated as a
percentage of the number of correctly detected pairs of organisms/proteins to the total
number of pairs. The other two measures, gORG and gPRT, account for the partial detection of
HPI information, when at least one of the two organisms or proteins is detected. Both
measures are defined as the percentage of the total number of detected organisms/proteins
to the total number of organisms/proteins in all HPIs.
Unfortunately, evaluating a method’s performance for the second task is more challenging,
since the HPI data are often (i) scattered across multiple sentences and (ii) redundant (for
instance, the same interaction between two proteins can be mentioned in several sentences).
The method assessment for the second task becomes even more challenging when multiple
HPIs are present in the same abstract.
We next introduce several strategies that address the above tasks for the PubMed
biomedical abstracts (here and below, we will always consider an abstract of the biomedical
publication together with the publication’s title; the latter often provides important
information on HPIs). One of the main reasons behind extracting HPI information from the
abstracts rather than entire papers is the fact that for many papers, the abstract is the only
information that is freely available in PubMed. The first strategy is to rely on the existing
methods for mining protein-protein interactions followed by additional post-processing to
filter out the intra-species interactions. Another approach employs the language-based
methods traditionally used in protein-protein interaction literature mining. The last
approach introduces a supervised-learning feature-based methodology, which has recently
emerged in the area of biomedical literature mining. While each of the approaches is
applicable to each of the three tasks, here we will focus on assessing their performance for
the first and third tasks.
4.1 Data collection
Collecting accurate, unbiased, non-redundant data on HPIs is a critical step for efficient
training of a supervised method as well as for an accurate assessment of any literature
mining approach. Both the positive set (abstracts containing HPI information) and the
negative set (abstracts that do not contain HPI information) were manually selected and
annotated. To obtain the set of potential candidates for the positive and negative sets we
have combined of both searching the existing HPI databases and the PubMed database. Our
positive set consisted of 175 HPI containing abstracts that include human and non-human
hosts. The abstracts containing human-pathogen interactions were collected by searching
and manually curating abstracts from PIG, a database of host-pathogen interactions
manually extracted from the literature (Driscoll, Dyer et al. 2009). For each abstract, we
required the presence of organism and protein names for both the host and the pathogen,
resulting in 89 abstracts. Unfortunately, in its current form, PIG only has the abstracts with
annotated human-pathogen interactions. Therefore to obtain the list of interactions between
non-human hosts and their pathogens, we searched using an extensive PubMed query. We

Mining Host-Pathogen Interactions

169

required the presence in the same abstract of (i) at least one (non-human) host name, (ii) at
least one pathogen name, (iii) and at least one interaction keyword. We then manually
selected from the list another 86 abstracts that contained HPI information, adding them to
the positive set.
To obtain candidates for the negative set, we performed an almost identical search
strategy using the same PubMed query but including ‘human’ to the list of the host
names. We again manually selected the abstracts to ensure that that they did not have any
HPI information, even though they contained the important keywords. Note that it is
significantly harder for a computational approach to distinguish between the abstracts
from the obtained negative training set and those from the positive set, compared to a
negative training set consisting of abstracts that were randomly chosen from PubMed. As
a result, we selected 175 abstracts where no HPI information was found, although some of
the abstracts included information on intra-species protein-protein interactions. The list of
manually curated positive and negative sets of PubMed abstracts can be found at:
http://korkinlab.org/datasets/philm/philm_data.html
4.2 A naïve approach based on literature mining of protein-protein interactions
In a simple naïve approach, we first establish whether an abstract contains any information
on a protein-protein interaction using the existing state-of-the-art literature mining methods
followed by extraction of the pair of interacting proteins (Fig. 1A). We rely on the PIE
system, which integrates the natural language processing and machine learning methods to
determine the sentences that contain protein-protein interactions in a PubMed abstract and
extract the corresponding protein names and the interaction keywords (Kim, Shin et al.
2008). Next, for each interacting protein we identify its corresponding organism by applying
NLProt protein/gene tagging software (Mika and Rost 2004). NLProt uses a number of
techniques, such as the dictionary search, rule-based detection, and feature-based
supervised learning, to extract the names of proteins and genes and tag them using SWISSPROT or TrEMBL identifiers (Boeckmann, Bairoch et al. 2003). The method also predicts the
most likely organisms associated with these proteins/genes. It was reported to have a
precision of 75% and a recall of 76% on detecting protein/gene names (Mika and Rost 2004).
Finally, for each sentence identified as containing a protein-protein interaction by the PIE
system, we determine if this interaction is a HPI. Specifically, if each of the two proteins
forming a protein-protein interaction belongs to a different organism, and these organisms
can be assigned the host-pathogen roles, then the interaction is classified as an HPI. To
assign the host-pathogen roles, we use our manually curated dictionaries of host and
pathogen organism names (Table 1).
We assessed the naïve approach by applying it to our testing set of 88 abstracts, 44 positive
and 44 negative examples. As a result in addressing Task 1, the obtained accuracy was 0.53,
precision was 1.0, and recall was 0.07 for the classification of HPI-containing abstracts (Task 1);
F-score and Matthews Correlation Coefficient were 0.13 and 0.19, correspondingly. We found
that the method almost completely failed to detect the abstracts containing HPI information;
the contribution to the accuracy came primarily from the true negative hits, containing 44 (out
of 44) abstracts from the negative testing set. Interestingly, both high precision and low recall
values could be attributed to the same property of the naïve approach: it failed to accurately
detect the protein-protein interactions. Indeed, all 41 false negatives were not due to the
approach’s failure to assign the host and pathogen roles to the identified organisms, but due to
its failure to identify a protein-protein interation in the abstract.

170

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

It is also not surprising that the naïve approach performed poorly when addressing Task 3:
the method was able to detect only two proteins out of 44 protein pairs and none of the 44
pairs of organisms, resulting in the only non-zero score of gPRT = 0.02; the other three scores,
fORG, fPRT, and gORG were equal to zero.

4.3 A language-based approach
Our second approach is inspired by the language-based methods in biomedical text mining,
which are also widely used in mining protein-protein interactions. In HPI text mining, we
are faced with additional challenges such as correctly associating the organism name for
each protein, ensuring that the extracted interaction is inter- and not intra-species
interaction, and combining the information about an HPI from multiple sentences. As a
result, these additional challenges necessitate adding new modules to the computational
pipeline of our approach compared with a pipeline for extracting general protein-protein
interactions. The HPI mining pipeline consists of the following 7 steps (Fig. 1B): (1) text
preprocessing, (2) entity tagging, where we identify protein/gene and organism names, (3)
grammar parsing, where we parse the input text into dependency structures (4) anaphora
resolution, where we identity references to pronouns, (5) syntactic extraction, where we split
a complex sentence into simple ones, (6) role matching, where we identify semantic roles in
each simple sentence, (7) interaction keyword tagging, and (8) extraction of the actual HPI
information. We note that this approach directly addresses Tasks 2 and 3 by finding the
sentences containing HPI information and extracting the corresponding pairs of host and
pathogen organisms and the interacting proteins/genes. Task 1 is addressed by classifying
each abstract based on whether there was at least one HPI with the complete information
extracted from the abstract’s text.
Entity tagging. The entity tagging module identifies named entities in a abstract, such as
protein/gene names and the corresponding organism names. For a language-based text
mining approach, it is critical that all named entities are accurately identified. Thus, our
language–based approach for HPI literature mining has the most elaborate entity tagging
module of all three approaches introduced here. Specifically, the module includes three
stages: (i) protein/gene name tagging using NLProt, (ii) host/pathogen organism dictionary
match, and (iii) post-processing. First, we apply the NLProt tagger to identify the names of
all proteins/genes occurring in the text and the corresponding organism names (Mika and
Rost 2004). We note that in a case when a protein with the same name exists for multiple
species, NLProt assigns the most likely organism for each entry of this protein. Second, we
find a UniProt accession number (Bairoch, Apweiler et al. 2005) for each identified protein
followed by grouping the proteins/genes with the same accession number into a
protein/gene entity. Third we search for the organisms missed by NLProt using expanded
versions of our host and pathogen organism dictionaries that include synonyms for each

172

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

organism name and group the organisms under NCBI Taxonomy IDs (Wheeler, Barrett et al.
2006). Since NLProt may not identify all organisms in the abstract, our module rescans the
abstract text again to find the remaining host and pathogen organisms. Finally, the system
revisits the entity tagging module again after the next module, Link grammar parsing,
provides the internal structure of the sentences in terms of its basic units, phrases. The idea
is that we can use the internal sentence structure to (i) find additional host/pathogen
information that is not present in the dictionary, and (ii) reassign protein/gene name to its
correct organism, if needed. This stage plays an important role in the entity tagging module,
since our host and pathogen dictionaries are potentially incomplete (not all organisms
provided by NLProt may be covered); in addition, the dictionaries overlap with each other
(the same organism can be both, a host and a pathogen). If an organism name suggested by
NLProt for a protein is not found in our dictionary, the entity tagging module nevertheless
tries to assign the organism’s role as a host or pathogen. It does so by searching for generic
keywords (such as “host”, “pathogen”, “pathogenic”, “pathogenesis”, etc.), in each phrase
containing the organism name. Similarly, the module checks the organism name suggested
by NLProt for a protein/gene by identifying the organism’s name in the phrase that
contains a protein/gene name. To do so the module relies on two search patterns:
1. Organism name + protein name (e.g., “Arabidopsis RIN4 protein”);
2. Protein name + preposition + organism name (e.g., “RXLX of human”).
The newly obtained information about the organism assignment then replaces the current
suggestions provided by NLProt. For instance, in the phrase “the Arabidopsis RIN4 protein”,
NLProt associates RIN4 with a pathogenic organism, while the dictionary search matches
Arabidopsis as a host organism and identifies this phrase as pattern P1. Therefore, Arabidopsis
is assigned as the organism for RIN4 protein, followed by the correct assignment of RIN4 as
a host protein.
Link grammar parsing. In our next module, we use natural language processing methods to
determine the intrinsic structure of each sentence in the abstract. In our approach, all
grammatical constructions are based on the link grammar, a context-free grammar that
relies on the dependency structure of natural language (Sleator and Temperley 1995). In link
grammar, every word has a linking requirement, which specifies which types of other
words or phrases can link to it. Two words can only be linked if their linking requirements
match. A link is represented as an arc above the two words (Fig. 2). The linking
requirements are organized into a dictionary that the grammar parser refers to when
analyzing a sentence. The principal structure in link grammar is the linkage, a set of links
that completely connect all words in a sequence. Such a sequence of words is called a link
grammar sentence if it satisfies three conditions: (i) the links do not cross (planarity), (ii)
each word is connected to at least another word by a link (connectivity), and (iii) the linking
requirements for each word in the sentence are not violated (satisfaction). For example, the
linkage for the sentence “Avirulence protein B targets the Arabidopsis RIN4 protein” is
shown in Fig. 2. In total, the link grammar has 107 main links, each of which can derive
many sub-links. We implemented the module using an open source link grammar parser
from AbiWord project (http://www.abisource.com/projects/link-grammar/). This project
implements the original link grammar (Sleator and Temperley 1995), combining it with
additional features such as adaptation of the parser to the biomedical sublanguage, BioLG
(Pyysalo, Salakoski et al. 2006) and an English-language semantic dependency relationship
extractor, RelEx (Fundel, Kuffner et al. 2007).

173

Fig. 2. Internal sentence structure annotated by a link grammar parser for an HPI relevant
sentence. Words are labelled with the part-of-speech tags: .n (noun) and .v (verb). A link
between two words can be formed to specify a dependency relation. Each dependency type
has its own unique label: AN, GN, Ss, Os, D*u, G.
Anaphora resolution. In the anaphora resolution module, we determine semantic meaning
for pronouns (it, they, he, she), and other language structures in the sentences. Unlike the
case of intra-species protein-protein interactions, the information on HPIs often spans
multiple sentences, with the pronouns often replacing the names of organisms or
proteins/genes. Therefore, to extract the complete information on a HPI, it is critical to have
an accurate anaphora resolution module. The module relies on the RelEx anaphora
resolution method, which employs Hobbs’ pronoun resolution algorithm (Hobbs 1978). For
example, in the sentence “The Pseudomonas syringae type III effector protein avirulence
protein B (AvrB) is delivered into plant cells, where it targets the Arabidopsis RIN4 protein”,
the anaphora resolution module resolves ‘it’ as ‘The Pseudomonas syringae type III effector
protein avirulence protein B (AvrB)’.
Syntactic extraction. Our syntactic extraction module splits each sentence into one or more
simple sentences, where a simple sentence consists of four components organized into the
following structure:

Subject (S) + Verb (V) + Object (O) + Modifying phrase of verb (M).
The module is built based on the automated extractor InTex (Ahmed, Chidambaram et al.
2005); it scans a sentence to find all links of the following four types. The first type, S-link,
connects a subject to a verb, where the subject is located before the verb in the sentence. The
second type, RS-link connects a verb to a subject, i.e., the subject is located after the verb in
the sentence. The third type, O-link, connects a verb to an object. Finally, the fourth type,
MV-link, connects a verb to a modifying phrase. The module first determines the beginning
of each simple sentence, which can be either an S-link or an RS-link. Following each verb
from an S- or RS-link, the module determines the verb range by including all possible verb
phrases, adverb phrases, or adjective phrase, before and after the verb. Finally, for each
simple sentence the module determines the objects and modifying phrases for the verb in
the corresponding verb range by identifying possible O-links and MV-links. For example,
the modules split sentence “The Pseudomonas syringae type III effector protein avirulence
protein B (AvrB) is delivered into plant cells, where it targets the Arabidopsis RIN4 protein”
into two simple sentences: “The Pseudomonas syringae type III effector protein avirulence
protein B (AvrB) is delivered into plant cells” and “The Pseudomonas syringae type III
effector protein avirulence protein B (AvrB) targets the Arabidopsis RIN4 protein”.
Interaction keyword tagging. In this module, the interaction keywords are tagged by
searching (i) our manually curated dictionary of interaction keyword stems, to reduce the
search time, and (ii) lexical database WordNet, which contains nouns, verbs, adjectives, and

174

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

adverbs grouped by semantic concepts, and which uses a morphological function to infer
the stem of a word (Fellbaum 1998). In the previous example, the module identifies
interaction keywords that are found in our dictionary: “delivered” (the stem is “deliver”)
and “targets” (the stem is “target”).
Role type matching. In this module, we specify the role of each syntactic component
depending on whether the component contains complete information about an HPI. Here,
we consider three types of roles: elementary, partial, and complete. A component of the
elementary type is defined to be a host entity, a pathogen entity, or an interaction keyword.
A component of the partial type includes any two distinct components of the elementary
type. Finally, a syntactic component of complete type includes components of all three
elementary types.
Interaction extraction. Once the role of each syntactic component is identified, the
components are searched against a set of interaction patterns. We first select components of
the complete type, since they contain complete information about an HPI occurring between
two proteins/genes. Next, we combine the elementary and partial components such that
they provide the complete HPI information.
An interaction pattern is defined as LS=RS. The left side (LS) is used to match the complete
type from syntactic component(s), and the right side (RS) is used to extract the interaction
information from each component. For example, the pattern S<E>V<E>O<E> =
P<S>I<V>H<O> indicates that if a simple sentence includes three components, each of
elementary type: subject, verb, and object, then the sentence contains (i) a pathogen entity in
the subject, (ii) an interaction keyword in the verb, and (iii) a host entity in the object. Note
that both sides include a matching part S-V-O. In this work, for our patterns we considered
the following seven matching parts: S-V-O, S-O, S-V-M, S-M, S, O, and M (for abbreviations,
see Syntactic extraction subsection). In addition to the above patterns, we use a set of three
template-based filters that allows us to remove those simple sentences that although satisfy
an interaction pattern, do not have a semantic connection between the host entity, pathogen
entity, and interaction keyword. The introduced templates are similar to those employed by
RelEx:
Pattern 1: A + interaction verb + B
Pattern 2: Interaction noun + ’between’ + A + ’and’ + B.
Pattern 3: Interaction noun + ’of’ + A + ’by’ + B,
where an interaction keyword can be either the interaction verb or interaction noun.
Interaction Normalization. When mining HPI information from literature, there are several
sources for ambiguous information. First, there may be multiple HPIs in the same abstract.
Second, the information about a single HPI may be spread over multiple sentences. Finally,
the sentences may contain duplicate information about the same HPI. Our last module
ensures that all sentences containing duplicate HPIs are accounted for and each HPI is
reported only once. To do so, we first extract all HPIs and then determine the duplicate
pairs. We define two HPIs as duplicate if they have the same host entity and the same
pathogen entity. We note that two duplicate HPIs may still have different interaction
keywords. To detect the duplication in HPIs, the module refers to the normalized
protein/gene names (in terms of UniProt accession numbers) and organism names (in terms
of taxonomy ids) obtained at the entity tagging module.
Performance of the language-based approach. To compare with the feature-based
approach, the language-based approach was evaluated using the same testing set of 44
positive and 44 negative examples. We first assessed the method’s performance in

Mining Host-Pathogen Interactions

175

addressing Task 1. The method was able to classify the abstracts with 0.65 accuracy, 0.84
precision, and 0.36 recall. The F-score and Matthew correlation coefficient measures were
0.51 and 0.36, correspondingly. The performance of the approach on a more difficult Task 3
was significantly better than of the naïve approach, especially in partial predictions: fORG =
0.18, fPRT = 0.14, gORG = 0.25, and gPRT = 0.25. With the pre-calculated NLProt annotation, the
average running time of the system on a single abstract was 36.3 sec. on a 2.4 Ghz Intel
workstation. The computationally most expensive, link grammar parsing, module used
99.95% of the total running time.
4.4 A feature-based machine learning approach
The basic idea behind the feature-based approach introduced here is to extract a set of
characteristic features that provide sufficient information for discriminating between an
abstract containing HPI information and another abstract that does not. Using a training set
of pre-annotated abstracts, the system can then learn how to efficiently discriminate
between these two abstract types. Moreover, the same characteristic features can be
calculated for the individual sentences in the abstract. Thus, we can use the same
supervised-learning approach to solve Tasks 1 and 2. Finally, to solve Task 3 one can use a
simple dictionary-based search for each sentence classified as containing HPI information.
Our feature-based approach consists of four basic stages (Fig. 1C). First, each abstract is preprocessed to find each protein/gene in the abstract and identify its organism name. Second,
for each abstract a feature vector is generated. Third, our supervised learning system is
trained by providing the feature vectors generated from the positive and negative sets.
Finally, the trained system is used on an independent testing set of HPI and non-HPI
abstracts to assess the approach.
Text preprocessing. We first add the publication title to the abstract as its first sentence. The
abstract is then further split into individual sentences by detecting the sentence termination
patterns. A basic pattern of a period (.), followed by a space and capitalized letter can be
directly used to distinguish sentences in a standard text. However, there are known
challenges when preprocessing a biomedical (or any scientific) publication. For instance, the
above simple approach is not always applicable, since the periods are often used in the
names of proteins, abbreviations such as “i.e.”, “e.g.”, “vs.”, and others. We first identify
such cases using a predefined dictionary, replace periods in these words by spaces, and then
apply the above basic pattern. The next steps of the preprocessing stage concerns with
detecting the organism and protein/gene names using the entity tagging software NLProt
(Mika and Rost 2004).
Support vector machines in text categorization. The problem of detecting whether an
abstract contains HPI information can be formulated as a problem of supervised text
categorization, with the goal of classifying abstracts into one of the selected categories. In
our case, two categories can be naturally defined: (i) abstracts containing HPI information
and (ii) abstracts without HPI information. Formally, given a training set of n objects, each
represented as a vector of N numerical features, xi = (x1, x2, …, xN), and their classification
into one of the two classes y{-1,1}, the goal is to train a feature-based classifier based on
the training set. After the training stage is completed, the classifier can assign a class label
from y for any new abstract x. In our approach, we use support vector machines (SVM)
(Vapnik 1998), a supervised learning method, which is well established in bioinformatics
and has been recently applied to identify abstracts containing host-bacteria interaction

176

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

information (Yin, Xu et al. 2010). The basic type of support vector machine (SVM) that
addresses this problem is a linear classifier defined by its discriminant function:

where w is a weight vector (Vapnik 1998). Geometrically, the problem can be described as
finding the decision boundary, a hyperplane that separates two sets of points,
corresponding to the sets of positive and negative examples. To do that, we maximize the
margin defined by the closest to the hyperplane positive and negative examples. An optimal
solution can be found by solving a related quadric optimization problem. The problem is
further generalized by introducing soft margins, allowing the classifier to misclassify some
points. The general optimization problem is often formulated in its dual form:

1 n n

subject to:

 yi i  0, 0   i  C for i  1, 2,..., n
i1

and the discriminant function is defined as:

f (x)   i1 yi i x i , x  b
n

.

Examples from the training set for which  i  0 are called support vectors. The formalism
can be further extended by introducing non-linear classifiers defined using kernel functions,
K  x, x   , similarity measures that replace the standard inner product x, x′. In our
approach, we applied and compared two widely used non-linear kernel functions: the





polynomial kernel, K P  x, x    x, x  1 , where d is degree of the polynomial, and
d

2

Gaussian radial basis function (RBF), K G ( x, x  )  exp( x  x  / c) . Both kernels are
implemented using libsvm a freely available SVM software package (Chang and Lin 2001).
Feature vectors. One approach to generating a descriptive set of features for an abstract is
to calculate the frequencies of occurrences of individual words (unigrams) as well as the
word pairs (bigrams) from a biomedical text corpus (Yin, Xu et al. 2010). While these
features can provide important information on the word usage, the number of features
depends strongly on the size of the corpus and can easily reach thousands of features. In our
approach, we propose to use a simpler 12-dimensional feature vector representation,
x   x1, x2 , , x12  , focusing on quantifying the information directly related to host-pathogen
interaction. Features x1 and x2 quantify the presence of host and pathogen protein or gene
names in the abstract and are calculated based on the protein/gene entity tagging obtained
by NLProt (Mika and Rost 2004). Each protein is classified as a host or pathogen protein
based on the source organisms extracted either from the NLProt tagging results or directly
from the abstract by searching against our dictionary of host and pathogen organisms (Table
1). The dictionary was built using the set of organisms extracted from several databases
(Winnenburg, Urban et al. 2008; Driscoll, Dyer et al. 2009; Kumar and Nanduri 2010) and by
adding generic keywords, such as “pathogen”, “host”, “plant”, etc. Similarly, features x3

Mining Host-Pathogen Interactions

177

and x4 specify the number of occurrences for the host and pathogen organism names. These
features are defined using NLProt-based organism annotation and the dictionary of host
and pathogen organisms. Binary feature x5 specifies the presence or absence of the general
protein-protein interaction keywords in the abstract. It is obtained by scanning the extended
abstract against our interaction keyword dictionary (Table 1). Features x6 and x7 describe
additional statistics on protein-protein interaction keyword occurrences. The former feature
is defined as the percentage of interaction keywords in the total number of words in the
abstract. The latter feature is defined as the percentage of sentences containing the
interaction keywords in the total number of abstract sentences. Feature x8 is calculated based
on the cumulative keyword typicality for each abstract. We define the typicality of a
keyword as the percentage of abstracts in the training set containing this keyword. Feature
x8 is calculated as a sum of typicalities for all protein-protein interactions keywords in a
given abstract. Our next feature x9 quantifies the amount of experimental evidence used to
support the HPI and is defined as the total number of experimental keywords in the
abstract, where each keyword is detected by scanning the abstract against our dictionary
experimental keywords (Table 1). Some abstracts report the absence of an interaction
between host and pathogen proteins. Determining the absence of interaction in an abstract
by a feature-based approach is difficult, since such an abstract is likely to contain the
information similar to an abstract describing a true HPI. One of the key differences between
these abstracts is the presence of negation keywords present in the former abstract. Feature
x10 accounts for such keywords and is defined as the percentage of negation keywords in the
total number of words in the abstract. Similar to other keywords, these keywords are
identified using our dictionary of collected negation keywords (Table XX3). A related
feature, x11, estimates whether a negation keyword is related specifically to the information
on protein-protein interaction in the abstract. The feature is defined as the number of words
between the negation keyword and the closest interaction keyword in a sentence. The last
feature, x12, accounts for the HPI-specific keywords, such as virulence, effectors, factors, etc.
determined using the corresponding dictionary (Table 1). It is calculated as a percentage of
such keywords in the total number of words in the abstract.
Supervised training and HPI detection using SVM. The trained SVM classifier is applied in
our method twice. First, it is applied to the abstracts to identify those containing HPI
information (Task 1). Second, it is applied to the individual sentences to determine those
that contain this HPI information (Task 2). When applied to a sentence, we generate a 12dimensional feature vector solely based on the information in this sentence and use it as an
input to the SVM classifier. Once the sentences containing HPI are identified, we use the
dictionaries of host and pathogen organisms combined with the protein/gene names to find
the pairs of host and pathogen organisms and the corresponding proteins/genes (Task 3).
The accuracy of an SVM-based classifier generally can be improved by optimizing a number
of parameters during the training stage. The error cost parameter, C, controls the tradeoff
between allowing training errors and forcing rigid margins. In our approach we select the
cost parameter and another parameter, Gamma, by evaluating the accuracies of trained
models for Task 1 using leave-one-out cross-validation. The values of C range from 2 to 20
and the values for Gamma range from 2−10 to 21. The set of parameters on which the SVM
classifier reaches its maximum accuracy is selected as a final model. In addition, we
optimize the degree of the polynomial when considering the polynomial kernel.
Assessment protocols. To assess the performance of the feature-based approach in abstract
classification, we employ two benchmarking protocols. In the first protocol, the SVM model

178

training is done on the training set and the assessment is performed exclusively on the
testing set (Table 2). For the second protocol we use the leave-one-out and 10-fold cross
validations on the training set.

Table 2. Testing and training sets of positive (HPI-relevant) and negative (HPI-irrelevant)
abstracts. Testing data are used to evaluate all three approaches, and training data are used
for SVM learning in the feature-based approach. The abstracts are extracted from then
PubMed database and manually curated.
Performance of the feature based approach. During the leave-one-out cross-validation, an
SVM model with the polynomial kernel of degree 3 and parameter values C=2 and
Gamma=0.0175 was found to be the most accurate in the abstract classification problem
(Table 3). The polynomial kernel was also the most accurate SVM model across both
assessment protocols. In addition, this SVM model had the highest recall value, with the
precision approaching its highest value. Overall, the performance of all three SVM kernels,
across all evaluation protocols, was similar. The performance of the feature-based approach
on Task 3 was slightly better than that of the language-based approach in partial
predictions: gORG = 0.39 and gPRT = 0.35. However the performance in complete pair
predictions was worse: fORG = 0.07 and fPRT = 0.07. The SVM classifier was efficient, taking
only 0.003 sec. to classify 92 abstracts by an SVM classifier on a 2.66 Ghz Intel Xeon (Quad)
workstation. However, the high efficiency of this approach was offset by a significantly
slower protein tagging component that was done using NLProt and took ~18 min. on the
same workstation to tag proteins in 262 abstracts from the dataset.

5. Conclusion
In this chapter, we discussed a new problem for biomedical literature mining that was
concerned with mining molecular interactions between the host and pathogen organisms.
Collecting HPI data is one of the very first steps towards studying and fighting infectious
diseases. Creating an automated framework for extracting the HPI information from the

Mining Host-Pathogen Interactions

179

biomedical literature, including millions of abstracts publicly available in PubMed database,
is instrumental in completing this step. We formulated three key tasks of HPI literature
mining and proposed three computational approaches that addressed these tasks: (i) a naïve
approach, which was based on the existing protein-protein interaction mining methods, (ii)
a language-based approach, which employed the link grammar, and (iii) a feature-based
supervised learning approach, which relied on SVM methodology. Both, feature-based and
language-based, approaches have been implemented in the PHILM (Pathogen-Host
Interaction Literature Mining) web-server, accessible at http://korkinlab.org/philm.html.
Several important conclusions can be drawn from the comparative assessment of all three
approaches. First, it became clear that being a new problem in biomedical literature mining
(and a more difficult one than mining general protein-protein interactions), HPI text mining
required development of new methods tailored to address the specifics of this problem.
Indeed, for the first task the naïve approach performed with the disappointingly low
accuracy of 53% and f-score of just 13%, while accuracy and f-score of the language-based
approach were significantly higher, 65% and 51%, correspondingly; the feature-based
method had even higher (10-fold) accuracy and f-score, 72% and 72%, correspondingly. We
note that the performance accuracy of both language-based and feature-based approaches
even at this early stage were comparable to the state-of-the-art protein-protein interactions
mining methods (Krallinger, Leitner et al. 2008). In addition to its poor performance in the
abstract classification task, the naïve approach completely failed to detect protein interaction
pairs and organism pairs in the third task. The feature-based approach performed
significantly better when detecting one of the interacting proteins or organisms, while still
failing to accurately detect the complete pairs. It was not surprising that the highest
accuracy of detecting both, host-pathogen organism pairs and protein pairs, was achieved
by the most sophisticated language-based approach. Second, the analysis of incorrectly
classified abstracts and identified pairs of proteins and organisms supported our conclusion
that increasing the accuracy of the name tagging system is pivotal to increasing the
classification accuracy in both approaches. Finally, both language-based and feature-based
approaches demonstrated good performance but in different tasks, which suggests that by
integrating these two approaches, one can obtain a system with a more accurate overall
performance than either of the individual approaches.

Interactions Using Bayesian Networks

1. Introduction
Signalling and regulatory pathways that guide gene expression have only been partially
defined for most organisms. Given the increasing number of microarray measurements, it
may be possible to reconstruct such pathways and uncover missing connections directly
from experimental data. One major question in the area of microarray-based pathway
analysis is the prediction of new elements to a particular pathway. Such prediction is
possible by independently testing the effects of added genes or variables on the overall
scores of the corresponding expanded networks. A general network expansion framework
to predict new components of a pathway was suggested in 2001 (Tanay and Shamir, 2001).
Many machine learning approaches for identifying hidden or unknown factors have
appeared in the literature recently (Gat-Viks and Shamir, 2007; Hashimoto, et al., 2004;
Herrgard, et al., 2003; Ihmels, et al., 2002; Needham, et al., 2009; Parikh, et al., 2010; Pena, et
al., 2005; Tanay and Shamir, 2001; Yu and Li, 2005).
Compared to existing pathway expansion methods based on correlation, Boolean, or other
strategies (Hashimoto, et al., 2004; Herrgard, et al., 2003; Ihmels, et al., 2002; Tanay and
Shamir, 2001), Bayesian network-based expansion methods provide distinct advantages. A
Bayesian network (BN) is a representation of a joint probability distribution over a set of
random variables (Friedman, et al., 2000). Bayesian networks are able to identify causal or
apparently causal relationships (Friedman, et al., 2000), and can be used to predict both
linear and nonlinear functions. Furthermore, BN analysis is robust to error and noise and
easily interpretable by humans. Bayesian network-based expansion has been used for gene
expression data analysis (Gat-Viks and Shamir, 2007; Pena, et al.). We have recently
developed an algorithm termed “BN+1” which implements Bayesian network expansion to
predict new factors and interactions that participate in a specific pathway (Hodges, et al.,
2010; Hodges, et al., 2010). This algorithm has been tested using E. coli microarray data
(Hodges, et al., 2010) and verified with a synthetic network (Hodges, et al., 2010).
This Book Chapter aims to first provide a detailed review on different computational
methods for pathway element prediction, introduce how a BN analysis is typically
performed, and then describe how this BN+1 algorithm works. We will also introduce our
MARIMBA software program (http://marimba.hegroup.org) which can implement the
BN+1 algorithm along with many other useful features. So far, the success of BN+1 in new
pathway element prediction has been demonstrated in prokaryotic E. coli system. This paper
will introduce our new study of applying BN+1 to predict new pathway elements for

186

eukaryotic B-cell receptor (BCR) pathway using high throughput microarray data from
perturbed B-cells obtained from the Alliance for Cellular Signalling (AfCS) (Zhu, et al.,
2004). Finally, we will present current challenges and possible future directions in this field.

2. Overview of different computational methods for prediction of new
pathway elements
In this section, we describe several existing methods for pathway expansion. By pathway
expansion, we mean the expansion of a known set of variables with some biological role or
function to include novel interacting or downstream variables. This definition is highly
flexible and can be used for a variety of biological and biomedical situations.
2.1 Correlation methods and pathway expansion
Some of the most prevalent approaches used towards analyzing high-throughput datasets
are correlation-based methods. Correlation methods attempt to identify the degree of
similarity or dissimilarity between two or more variables (e.g., the expression profiles of two
genes) using simple computational distance metrics, such as Manhattan and Pearson metrics
(Herrero, et al., 2001). An underlying assumption is that cellular processes often require the
participation of multiple gene products which are expected to show correlated expression
patterns as well as physical interactions (Meier and Gehring, 2008).
To predict new pathway elements using correlation methods, one or more genes (or other
biological entities) are usually selected initially as a target of interest for comparison. A
correlation is then determined between each other gene’s (or entity’s) expression pattern
and that of the gene of interest. Those correlations appearing above some established
threshold or ranking are then represented as either edges in a network or as a
dendrogram in an expression-based heatmap diagram. For example, Herrgard et al
defined subset of variables with specific modular behaviors and network structure using
correlations and linear multiple regression (Herrgard, et al., 2003). These modules are
then expanded to identify other neighboring variables with likely interactions or
influences with the module-based sub-networks. Tanay et al (2001) introduced a fitness
function-based approach for expanding sets of variables in literature models (Tanay and
Shamir, 2001).
One advantage of these correlation-based methods is the ability to compute all pair-wise
correlations for genes or features on a gene expression microarray or other high-throughput
datasets. However, the correlation networks themselves do not imply any directionality for
the interactions, such as which gene activates or represses a correlated gene, or whether
those genes are instead co-regulated by another biological entity. The types and sometimes
directionality of interactions must be determined using one or more analysis procedures,
such as gene enrichment, promoter analysis, and context-dependent (or conditiondependent) analysis (Meier and Gehring, 2008). The correlation-based methods are often
sensitive to the underlying distance metrics and assumptions, and are easily misinterpreted
when the wrong metrics are employed. In addition, nonlinear (e.g. biphasic) interactions
cannot usually be detected using correlation-based methods.
2.2 Clustering-based identification of new pathway elements
Various clustering method can be used to group genes based on expression values and
identify potential new genes to specific pathways. Unsupervised and supervised clustering

Prediction of Novel Pathway Elements and Interactions Using Bayesian Networks

187

methods have been developed (Raychaudhuri, et al., 2001). Unsupervised clusting methods,
such as hierarchical clustering (Eisen, et al., 1998), self-organizing maps (Tamayo, et al.,
1999), and model-based clustering (e.g., CRCView (Xiang, et al., 2007)), arrange genes and
samples in groups/clusters based solely on the similarities in gene expression. Supervised
methods, including EASE (Hosack, et al., 2003) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
(Subramanian, et al., 2005), use sample classifiers and gene expression to identify
hypothesis-driven correlations. The Gene Ontology program (GO) is frequently used for
gene enrichment analysis by many software programs, for example, DAVID (Huang da, et
al., 2009) and GOStat (Beissbarth and Speed, 2004). One major disadvantage of such
clustering-based methods on identifying new pathway elements is that detailed gene-gene
interactions and directionalities cannot be predicted.
2.3 Boolean network-based pathway expansion
In Boolean network modelling, originally introduced by Kauffman (Kauffman, 1969)
(Kauffman, 1969) (Kauffman, 1969), gene expression is quantized to only to two levels: ON
and OFF. The gene expression level (state) of each gene is functionally related to the
expression states of some other genes using logical rules. Probabilistic Boolean Networks
(PBN) share the appealing rule-based properties of Boolean networks, but are robust in the
face of uncertainty (Shmulevich, et al., 2002). Hashimoto et al. proposed a method to grow
genetic regulatory networks from seed genes based on PBN analysis (Hashimoto, et al.,
2004). In their study, Boolean functions were implemented towards globally expanding a set
of seed genes from known literature-extracted interactions for vascular endothelial growth
factor pathway genes using melanoma and glioma data (Hashimoto, et al., 2004). The output
of this algorithm depends on the PBN-based objective function. The disadvantage of this
approach is that the two-level representation in Boolean network often oversimplifies the
complex biological systems.
2.4 Mutual information-based method
Mutual information-based methods have been used for modelling, refining, and
expanding biological pathways. In probability theory and information theory, the mutual
information of two random variables is a quantity that measures the mutual dependence
of the two variables. Recent reports by Luo et al. (Luo, et al., 2008; Luo and Woolf, 2010;
Watkinson, et al., 2009) and others have shown the utility and improved modelling of
using three-way and higher mutual information influences for a given variable. However,
the assembly of these multi-parent interactions into larger global networks is yet a
challenging issue.
2.5 Bayesian network pathway refinement and expansion
Bayesian networks have recently been widely used for biological pathway reconstruction
and expansion. Since this is the major topic of this book chapter, we will introduce it in more
details in the next sections.

3. Bayesian network (BN) analysis
In this section, we introduce Bayesian networks and their uses in biomedical research. Most
specifically, models generated for understanding biological pathways and relevant gene
regulatory networks are discussed.

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

3.1 Introduction to Bayesian networks
One exciting development in bioinformatics research was the advent and application of
Bayesian networks (BN) in biological research. Basically, BNs are graphical
representations of statistical interdependencies amongst sets of nodes. BNs model
interactions amongst sets of variables (e.g. genes, proteins) as probabilistic dependencies
or influences. Judea Pearl introduced the notion of Bayesian networks in 1985 (Pearl, 1985;
Pearl, 1988) to emphasize three aspects: (i) Often subjective nature of the input data
information; (ii) Reliance on Bayes’s conditioning as the basis for information updating;
and (iii) Distinction between causal and evidential modes of reasoning. Bayesian
networks were later implemented by Heckerman et al, Friedman et al, and various other
research labs towards biological research (Cooper and Herskovits, 1992; Friedman, et al.,
2000; Heckerman, 1995).
Specifically, a BN for a set of variables X = {X1, X2, ...,Xn} consists of (1) a network structure
S that encodes a set of conditional independence assertions about variables in X, and (2) a
set P of conditional probability distributions associated with each variable (Heckerman,
2008). Together, these components denote the joint probability distribution for X. The BN
structure S is a directed acyclic graph, meaning that the network is hierarchical and
has both top-level and terminal nodes and no directed paths which eventually return to
them. We use Pai to denote the parents of node Xi in S as well as the variables
corresponding to those parents. Given structure S, the joint probability distribution for X
is given by
(1)
Different methods have been developed to learn BN structures and will be introduced in
detail next.
3.2 Learning Bayesian networks (BNs)
The problem of learning a Bayesian network can be stated as follows: given a training
dataset of independent instances, find a network that best matches the dataset. The common
approach to this problem is to introduce a statistically sound scoring function that evaluates
each network with respect to the training dataset and to search for the optimal network
based on this score.
To dissect the processes of learning BNs, we summarize five major steps as follows:
1. Data selection and pre-processing
2. Prior definition (including variables and edges)
3. Selection of network searching strategy (e.g., simulated annealing, greedy)
4. BN execution with a specific scoring method
5. Results output and analysis
These steps will be introduced in detail here for gene expression data analysis:
3.2.1 Data selection and preprocessing
BN is a powerful tool for analyzing high throughput data, e.g., DNA microarray data. Preprocessing is usually required to normalize raw data and possibly filter out those genes that
do not show significant changes over all conditions.

3.2.2 Prior definition (including variables and edges)
After selecting appropriate data and variable sets for investigation, settings for the BN
simulation must be chosen. Initially, assumptions must be made as to whether structural
priors (e.g. the requirement of certain interactions to appear in a model) should be included
or not in the BN analysis. It is not necessary to assume any structural priors for the initial set
of variables. However, structural priors can be implemented, especially in cases where the
biological interactions to be represented are well-established and also fully represented in
the underlying biological data used for modelling.
3.2.3 Set up network searching strategy
Once the prior is specified, the BN learning becomes finding a structure that maximizes the
BN score according to a BN scoring function. This problem is proven to be NP-complete
(Chickering, 1996). Thus heuristic search is needed. The decomposition of the score is crucial
for the optimization problem. For example, a local search procedure that changes one edge
at a time can efficiently evaluate the gains of a specified score made by adding, removing, or
reversing an edge. An example of such a procedure is a greedy random search algorithm
with random restarts. Although this procedure does not necessarily achieve a global
maximum, it reaches a local maximum and does perform well in practice (Friedman, et al.,
2000). Another commonly used method is simulated annealing search algorithm with a
temperature schedule that allows for “reannealing" as the temperature is lowered
(Heckerman, 1995). Other BN searching strategies include stochastic hill-climbing and
genetic algorithm (Friedman, et al., 2000).
3.2.4 Bayesian network scoring approaches
The key part of BN learning is to determine a scoring metric that compares networks
and identifies the most likely or ‘best supported’ networks. Bayesian network scoring is
based upon conditional probabilities. One commonly used scoring method is the BDe score
(Cooper and Herskovits, 1992; Heckerman, 1995), which is a posterior probability defined
as:
n

qi

P  M|D   
i 1 j 1

( ri  1)!

 Nij  ri  1

ri

 N ijk ! ,
!

(2)

k 1

where n is the number of variables, qi is the number of parent configurations for given
variable i, ri is the arity of variable i, Nij is the number of observations with selected parent
configuration qi, Nijk is the number of observations of child in state k with parent
configuration qi (Cooper and Herskovits, 1992). The calculation of this score is implemented
in many software programs such as BANJO (Smith, et al., 2006).
Another BN scoring method is the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), which was
specifically designed to compensate for overfitting (Schwarz, 1978).
3.2.5 Bayesian network analysis software
Many BN analysis software programs are available. Dr. Kevin Murphy provides an
excellent summary of existing software packages for Bayesian network modelling
(http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/Bayes/bnsoft.html). Table 1 lists selected BN software
programs from Dr. Murphy’s website and other resources.

3.2.6 BN result output and analysis
To visualize BN results, different methods can be performed. For example, BANJO uses DOT
type of BN result output (Reference: http://www.graphviz.org/Documentation/dotguide.pdf).
MARIBMA uses DOT and can also export networks as .sif format for use in Cytoscape
(http://www.cytoscape.org). Since different BNs are available, it is crucial for a user to select
‘best-scoring’ networks and/or generate consensus networks. Often methods are also needed to
build weighted networks based on computational analysis or from literature and other database
queries.

4. Bayesian network expansion methods
Bayesian network (BN) expansion is an approach that is built upon the BN method and aims
to identify new pathway elements that participate in a specified network. In this section, we
will introduce basic BN expansion methods and then focus on describing our internally
developed BN+1 algorithm and its implementation.
4.1 General BN expansion
Compared to the otehr network expansion methods described above, Bayesian networkbased expansion methods provide distinct advantages, such as prediction of both linear and
nonlinear functions, robustness in noise data analysis, and identification of causal or
appearly causal influences representing interactions among genes. In general, Bayesian
network expansion can be defined as the addition of new variables to an existing network,
followed by rescoring and ranking of those variables.
BN-based expansion has been used for gene expression data analysis (Gat-Viks and Shamir,
2007; Pena, et al.). For example, Pena et al. reported an algorithm AlgorithmGPC that also
grows BN models from seed genes (Pena, et al.). This approach starts with one single gene
and builds networks around this gene through expansion and pruning with a set number of
genes. Gat-Viks et al also generated a Bayesian network-based refinement and expansion
method (Gat-Viks and Shamir, 2007). A main limitation of this approach is that it requires
high quality of prior knowledge on the signaling pathways. The topology of the biological
pathways may not be consistent with networks learned from transcriptional gene expression
data obtained via DNA microarray studies. Therefore, a fixed topology as initial seed
network may not be appropriate for robust network expansion simulaions.
Other BN expansion methods have also been published (Needham, et al., 2009; Parikh, et al.,
2010). These approaches differ from each other but all showed different levels of success in
identifying new pathway elements. In the following two sections, we will introduce our
BN+1 algorithm (Hodges, et al., 2010; Hodges, et al., 2010), and how it is implemented in the
MARIMBA software.
4.2 The BN+1 algorithm
In our recent study, we developed an algorithm termed “BN+1” which implements
Bayesian network expansion to predict new factors and interactions that participate in a
specific pathway (Hodges, et al., 2010; Hodges, et al., 2010). Broadly, the BN+1 algorithm
iteratively tests to see if any single variable added to a given pathway will significantly
improve the likelihood of the overall network. This approach is based on the observation
that those variables which are hidden and regulate or are regulated by a network are more
likely ranked with high posterior probability scores. Using a compendium of microarray
gene expression data obtained from Escherichia coli, the BN+1 algorithm predicted many
novel factors that influence the E. coli reactive oxygen species (ROS) pathway. Some of the
predicted new ROS and biofilm regulators (e.g., uspE and its interaction with gadX) were
further experimentally verified (Hodges, et al., 2010). In another study, a synthetic network
was also designed to further evaluate this algorithm. Based on the synthetic data analysis,
the BN+1 method is able to identify both linear and nonlinear relationships and correctly
identify variables near the starting network (Hodges, et al., 2010).
The BN+1 algorithm is specified in Figure 1. A few notes are provided here in our BN+1
implementation:

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

The selection of seed (or core) genes is an important step. The seed genes can be
selected from an existing pathway database, from literature survey, or from internal
experimental results. Since it is computationally expensive to calculate BNs using a
large number of variables, it is often necessary to filter out some genes from an initial
list using different criteria, for example, filtering out those genes that do not have
significant changes among all microarray chips.
While we use a top network structure generated from initial core gene simulation as a
prior, we prefer not to fix the core network structure for subsequent network expansion.
This preference makes our approach differ from a commonly used method of fixing the
prior structure. Our argument is that the prior structure is often determined by many
layers of studies, including DNA, RNA and protein data analyses. When only RNA
transcriptomic data are used, such prior structure may not hold. The fixture of a prior
structure would result in obtaining suboptimal networks that do not match the datasets
used for BN simulation.
BN+1 Algorithm
Input: N variables (e.g., genes) from a dataset (e.g., microarray dataset) with L observations each.
Data Preprocessing (Optional)

strategy (e.g. simulated annealing), and structural priors.

Save top BN network topology C

Generate new data file D* by concatenating L observations for a to data file D
Select settings for BN simulation.
Execute BN simulation.
Save top network and its posterior probability for a.
Rank each variable according to posterior probability.
Output: Rank-ordered BN+1 results.

4.3 Implementation of BN+1 using MARIMBA
MARIMBA is implemented using a three-tiered architecture built on two Dell Poweredge
2580 servers which run the Redhat Linux operating system. Users submit analysis requests
and database queries through the web. These queries are then processed using PHP, Perl,
Python, JavaScript, and SQL (middle-tier, application server based on Apache) against a
MySQL (version 5.0) relational database (back-end, database server). The result of each
query is then presented to the user in the web browser.

Fig. 2. Workflow of MARIMBA implementation of BN+1 algorithm.
The main MARIMBA system architecture and pipeline for analysis of project data is
described in Figure 2 and contains the following steps:
1. Data Upload: A user can upload gene expression data using specified format.
2. Gene Selection: A gene list as core gene set for BN modeling will be specified by the user.
3. Write up BN and BN+1 files: The basic MARIMBA-formatted files are then generated
dynamically by MARIMBA for use in Bayesian modeling.
4. Selection of BN parameters: BN simulation settings were selected after completing the
data and gene selection processes, respectively. A static BN simulation was created to
analyze the microarray data. Many settings can be selected by the user. For example, a
user can select simulated annealing or greedy method as the network searcher method.
We prefer simulated annealing due to its improved performance over greedy searches
when no prior knowledge of underlying structure is available (Hartemink, et al., 2002).
In our simulated annealing analysis, a relatively low cooling factor is often
implemented to allow less restrictive searching of the sample space and potentially
identify as many equivalence classes for the top-scoring network as possible. Currently,
up to 1,000 networks can be stored in MARIMBA for each run.
5. Execution of BN and BN+1modeling: BN files are submitted via the online interface in
MARIMBA. Each dataset is transferred to the server prior to simulation by a parallel
computer cluster. Each agent runs a unique BANJO simulation. The core BN network is
employed as a fixed topology/prior knowledge network in the BN analysis. A BN+1
simulation can also be implemented as defined by a user.
6. BN Result display and interpretation: MARIMBA displays top-scoring networks of BN and
BN+1 simulations to the user. The images of top-scoring networks are converted
directly from their original dot files and are displayed as jpeg images on-the-fly.
In addition, MARIBMA is able to calculate conserved edges over a selected number of
stored networks. To calculate the conserved edges, MARIMBA determines core BN
models by model averaging and equivalence class searching. Here, model averaging is
defined as inclusion of an edge between two genes if that edge appeared in more than
X percent of the top-scoring networks with identical score. Furthermore, The BN+1
visualization environment in MARIMBA displays a plot for posterior probabilities of
saved networks, thus enabling comparison of networks for relevance and likelihood.

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

Compared to the standalone BANJO system (Bose, et al., 2006), MARIMBA is web-based
and allows seamless integration of user project management, analysis construction, BN
submission and execuation in a parallel computing environment, and analysis and
visualization of results. The user-friendly GUI environment simplifies dataset selection,
probeset/gene inclusion, observational file processing, and settings selection for BN
execution. Such features are necessitated for efficient querying by biologists who wish to use
such BN tools to analyze their data. In addition, the BN+1 algorithm execution and project
management is a unique feature in MARIBMA and does not exist in BANJO or any other
software program.

5. Use case study: Application of BN+1 to BCR pathway modelling
5.1 Introduction
As an example of the challenge of merging a pathway model and gene expression data, this
study focuses on the B-cell receptor pathway (BCR) as described by KEGG (Kanehisa and
Goto, 2000; Kanehisa, et al., 2010). The BCR pathway is an integral component of the
adaptive immune response mechanism by which B cells respond to foreign antigens (Lucas,
et al., 2004). The BCR pathway involves in the activation of specific protein kinase C (PKC)
isoforms that induces ultimate activation of the NF-B transcription factor. Multiple protein
species accumulate at the cell membrane in a signalosome complex and are linked to the B
cell receptor. Signal propagation from the BCR via kinase-mediated phosphorylation
cascades to downstream effectors such as Nfkb, NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells),
and AP1 is either enhanced or reduced via signalosome interactions with co-stimulatory or
co-inhibitory complexes, respectively. BCR signaling guides many important functions such
as anergy, B cell ontogeny, and immune response, and is linked to the several imporant
pathways: MAPK, coagulation/complement cascades, and actin cytoskeleton (Kanehisa and
Goto, 2000; Kanehisa, et al., 2010). NF-B plays a crucial role in the antigen-induced B
lymphocyte proliferation, cytokine production, and B cell survival (Lucas, et al., 2004).
While the KEGG pathway database includes a manually curated BCR pathway, this
pathway is still considered incomplete (Lucas, et al., 2004).
5.2 Microarray data processing and BN analysis methods
We used gene expression data from perturbed B-cells obtained from the Alliance for
Cellular Signaling (AfCS) (Lee, et al., 2006; Zhu, et al., 2004). This dataset is especially
attractive because the same tissues were treated with combinations of ligands that perturb
different B cell pathways. The AfCS study gathered 424 microarray chips measuring gene
expression in B cells from M. musculus splenic extracts that are exposed to 33 different
ligands (Lee, et al., 2006; Papin and Palsson, 2004; Zhu, et al., 2004). Briefly, B cells purified
from splenic preparations from 6- to 8-wk-old male C57BL/6 mice were treated in triplicates
or quadruplicates with medium alone, or one of 33 different ligands for 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h
(AfCS protocol PP00000016). RNA was extracted following standard AfCS protocol
PP00000009. An Agilent cDNA microarray chip that contains 15,494 cDNA probes printed
on 15,832 spots was used. It represents 10,615 unique MGI gene matches (Lee, et al., 2006).
Each Agilent array was hybridized with Cy5-labeled cDNA prepared from splenic B cell
RNA and Cy3-labeled cDNA prepared from RNA of total splenocytes used as an internal
reference (AfCS protocol PP00000019). Hence, each Agilent microarray chip provides one
unique observation of relative expression level per selected probe. The arrays were scanned

using Agilent Scanner G2505A, and images were processed using the Agilent G2566AA
Feature Extraction software version A.6.1.1. The microarray raw data were downloaded
from the AfCS repository at ftp://ftp.afcs.org/pub/datacenter/microarray/.
Microarray data were discretized for each variable in the Bayesian networks using quantile
normalization with three bins. Though triplicate or quadruplicate microarray experiments
were available in most cases per unique treatment and time of drug administration, we
assume that each experiment provides an independent source of information. In this
analysis, we did not use all BCR pathway genes. We sought to answer here whether
expansion of a sub-network from the BCR pathway would preferentially recover other BCR
pathway genes. This assumption is advantageous in that the number of variables allows
significantly faster simulation searches for the BN and BN+1 simulations. Particularly, those
genes most specifically involved in Nfkb-mediated transcriptional regulation were chosen
from the KEGG BCR pathway.
A set of 10,000 top-scoring BNs was generated using the eight variables (the core) and 424
observations. Among the eight variables, two variables are Nfkbie probe sets, and two are
Ikbkb probe sets. In many cases, one gene has multiple probe sets. We chose to separate
them as different variables in our BN analysis since often these probe sets have different
values with low correlation (Fig. 3). This BN analysis was accomplished by running 100
independent simulations and saving the top 100 simulations for each of those runs.

receptor signaling pathway genes. Gene symbols and corresponding Agilent probe
identifiers are represented in nodes in the network. Directed edges represent those
influences appearing in the same direction in all top-scoring Bayesian networks, while
undirected edges appear at least once in the opposite direction though appearing
cumulatively with 100% frequency in all of the top networks.
Compared with the KEGG BCR pathway, the consensus network found in our BN analysis
(Fig. 2) has a 75% overlap with known interactions (3 out of 4 were correctly predicted),
with only one interaction missing (Fig. 5).

Fig. 5. Schematic representation of the BN+1 analysis results in the content of KEGG BCR
pathway. The three blue boxes represent three major sub-networks within the BCR pathway
with distinct regulatory and functional roles. The BN core network was defined using
members from the third sub-network (dark grey boxes) which reflect major components of
Nfkb signalling. Bolded gene names are those genes which were not included in the core
network, yet were recovered during BN+1 analysis in the top 100 results. Note that not all
members of the listed Nfkb signalling pathway were included in the core network (e.g.
Ikbkg), and in some cases were not available on the microarray platform.

5.3.2 Defining BN+1 genes
One of the top-scoring networks used to generate the consensus shown in Fig. 4 was used as
a core network for subsequent BN+1 expansion. BN+1 searching was executed for 14,353
individual probes with 50 million networks searched per probe. If only those genes in close
neighbourhood in the KEGG BCR pathway are considered, out of 19 selected genes, nine
genes were found to be connected to the core network in our analysis. Furthermore, four of
these nine genes are in close proximity (within top 10% of top-scoring BN+1 genes with at
least one connection to the core network) with these core genes in the KEGG protein
signalling pathway: Card11, Prkcb1, Ikbkg, and Vav2. These results suggest that the
neighbourhood of transcriptional regulation around the core network as well as distance
between the elements in the protein signalling pathway are related to each other.
Analysis of the top BN+1 variables recovered during simulation revealed several interesting
results. First, the top set of BN+1 variables is listed in Table 1.

Notes: Identifier information for each ranked gene is provided, including Agilent probe ID (Agi_ID),

Table 2. Top ten predicted BN+1 genes.
Many interesting findings were observed from this analysis. Many genes, for example, the
Sjorgen syndrome antigen B gene (Ssb) (Brenet, et al., 2009), have been shown to be
associated with the Nf-kB and BCR pathways. Ssb plays an important role in polysome
translation (Brenet 2009), and is an early DNA-damage responder in apoptotic cells and
those treated with cytotoxic chemicals (Al-Ejeh, et al., 2007). Interestingly, we identified
Jmjd1c, a member of the jumonji family proteins, as a top predicted gene in our BN+1
simulation. Jmjd1c is conserved in several mammalian species and has documented roles in
metal ion binding, oxidoreductase activity, and transcriptional regulation (Katoh, 2007). The
murine Jmjd1c mRNA is expressed in multiple tissues, including hematopoietic and
undifferentiated ES stem cells, fertilized egg, pancreatic islet, etc (Katoh, 2007). Jmjd1c has a
promoter region orthologous to humans with binding sites for the AP-1 transcription factor,
which is considered a member of the BCR signalling pathway and is included in the KEGG

representation as AP1 (downstream of the Raf/MEK sub-network in Figure 5 though not in
our core network). Fig. 6 illustrates the strongly-correlated relationships uncovered between
the Jmjd1c genes and connected core network members. As another example, the Cxcl13 is a
chemokine ligand in B cells with a C-X-C motif. It has already been established that Cxcl13
induction requires activation of canonical and non-canonical Nf-kB pathways (Suto, et al.,
2009), which confirms the prediction of this gene in our network. These data strongly
support the predictions generated by our analysis.

Fig. 6. Scatter plot of expression values for core genes Pik3cg and Ikbkb (both probes)
versus BN+1 gene Jmjd1c. A non-linear association between Pik3cg and Jmjd1c is
observed (A). A roughly linear relation is observed between Jmjd1c and Ikbkb(1) (Pearson
correlation coefficient: 0.71) (B) and between Jmjd1c and Ikbkb(2) (Pearson correlation
coefficient: 0.79) (C).
One property of interest, as shown in the table, is that the core genes which recruit the top
BN+1 genes are not always the same. From this analysis and previous studies, we have
observed that BN+1 variables which show high correlations to at least one core network
variable often appear as top BN+1 results. However, in some cases, the BN+1 variable may
connect to multiple variables in the core network, and yet show moderate to low
correlations with each of them. It is observed that many BN+1 variables have multiple core
network variables as parent nodes in the predicted top network. Multi-parent relationships
are less common, though statistically more meaningful due to the nature of the
implemented conditional probability tables in BDe scoring.
Different methods, such as clustering and GO gene enrichment, can be used to further
analyze BN+1 genes.
5.3.3 Clustering analysis of core genes and BN+1 genes
A clustering method provides a way to group BN+1 genes based on gene expression values.
A heapmap clustering analysis was performed using 8 probe sets in the core network and 10
probe sets from the BN+1 analysis (Fig. 7). As shown in this heatmap, all NF-B genes (core
genes in our BN simulation) are clustered together, indicating their close association. Our
analysis also found that Jmjd1c is closely associated with these NF-B genes. This further
strengthens our BN+1 prediction of the important role of this gene in the NF-B pathway in
B cell signalling.

5.3.4 GO enrichment of predicted BN+1 genes
Our previous studies indicate that the top few hundred BN+1 genes (i.e. those genes
predicted by the BN+1 algorithm) often interact with the seed gene network and biologically
active relevant to the pathway of interest (Hodges, et al., 2010; Hodges, et al., 2010). A GO
gene enrichment analysis was performed using 250 top BN+1 genes (Table 3). Given the
nature of the Nfkb-selected core network and their roles in nuclear localization and
transcriptional initiation, it was not surprising that many of the recovered genes show some
nuclear compartmentalization. Interestingly, many apoptotic and death-related genes were
enriched (Table 3).

6. Conclusion
In this paper, different bioinformatics methods for network expansion and detection of new
pathway elements are surveyed. Bayesian network-based expansion methods are
specifically introduced. Particularly, we outline our BN+1 Bayesian network method that
can be used to iteratively compare BDe scores and rank those genes that are likely critical to
a specific pathway or network. BN+1 has been successfully demonstrated in E. coli system
and synthetic data simulation. In this paper, we first demonstrate its use in BCR pathway, a
eukaryotic signalling pathway. Our study shows that BN+1 can also be used to predict
pathway elements and gene interactions in important eukaryotic pathways. Therefore, the
BN+1 algorithm appears to be a generic BN expansion system that can be used to study
other prokaryotic and eukaryotic pathways.
Many future directions are envisioned. For example, we can extend the BN+1 algorithm to
BN+2, BN+3, or BN+n algorithm by iteratively adding more than one variable to the seed
gene network. The principle used in the development of the BN+1 algorithm can also be
used for dynamic BN analysis. We are currently in the process of developing a DBN+1
algorithm and using it for temporal data analysis.

1. Introduction
One of the most fascinating aspects of RNA interference (RNAi) is the non-cell-autonomous
nature of silencing. Seminal studies on RNAi focused on the ability of transgene silencing to
propagate systemically throughout an organism, such as from a single Agrobacterium
infiltrated leaf to other parts of the plant, or from a grafted silenced stock into a non-silenced
scion[1, 2]
The discovery of RNAi was preceded first by observations of transcriptional inhibition by
antisense RNA expressed in transgenic plants[3] and more directly by reports of unexpected
outcomes in experiments performed by plant scientists in the U.S. and The Netherlands in
the early 1990s[4] In an attempt to alter flower colors in petunias, researchers introduced
additional copies of a gene encoding chalcone synthase, a key enzyme for flower
pigmentation into petunia plants of normally pink or violet flower color. Soon after, a
related event termed quelling was noted in the fungus Neurospora crassa [5], although it was
not immediately recognized as related. Further investigation of the phenomenon in plants
indicated that the downregulation was due to post-transcriptional inhibition of gene
expression via an increased rate of mRNA degradation[6]. This phenomenon was called cosuppression of gene expression, but the molecular mechanism remained unknown.
Not long after, plant virologists working on improving plant resistance to viral diseases
observed a similar unexpected phenomenon. While it was known that plants expressing
virus-specific proteins showed enhanced tolerance or resistance to viral infection, it was not
expected that plants carrying only short, non-coding regions of viral RNA sequences would
show similar levels of protection. Researchers believed that viral RNA produced by
transgenes could also inhibit viral replication[7]. The reverse experiment, in which short
sequences of plant genes were introduced into viruses, showed that the targeted gene was
suppressed in an infected plant. This phenomenon was labeled "virus-induced gene
silencing" (VIGS), and the set of such phenomena were collectively called post
transcriptional gene silencing [8][15].
The spread of RNA silencing is not limited to plants or viruses: the first reported
experiments of RNAi in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) demonstrated a systemic silencing
response induced by locally injected or ingested double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)
molecules[9, 10]. In plants, as in C. elegans, the systemic silencing signal acts in a sequencespecific manner, invoking the involvement of an RNA component. Sequence-specific RNA

206

silencing that acts non-cellautonomously has tremendous implications, not only practically
as an experimental tool but in biological processes as well. The long-distance movement of
RNA silencing through the vasculature forms a crucial component of the antiviral defence
system and has been implicated in microRNA (miRNA)-regulated stress responses[11] [12,
13] RNA dependent gene silencing can also move from cell to cell to elicit short-range
signaling responses, such as in the patterning of leaves and roots[14, 15].
After these initial observations in plants, many laboratories around the world searched for
the occurrence of this phenomenon in other organisms[16] [16]. Craig C. Mello and Andrew
Fire's 1998 Nature paper reported a potent gene silencing effect after injecting double
stranded RNA into C. elegans [9]. In investigating the regulation of muscle protein
production, they observed that neither mRNA nor antisense RNA injections had an effect on
protein production, but double-stranded RNA successfully silenced the targeted gene. Fire
and Mello's discovery was particularly notable because it represented the first identification
of the causative agent of a previously inexplicable phenomenon. Fire and Mello were
awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2006 for their work.
MicroRNAs are the most thoroughly characterized. These single-stranded RNAs are
typically 19 to 25 nucleotides in length and are thought to regulate gene expression posttranscriptionally by binding to the 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs) of target mRNAs,
inhibiting their translation[17]. Recent experimental evidence suggests that the number of
unique miRNAs in humans could exceed 800 [18], though several groups have hypothesized
that there may be up to 20,000[19] [20] noncoding RNAs that contribute to eukaryotic
complexity.
RNA polymerase II transcribes miRNA genes, generating long primary transcripts (primiRNAs) that are processed by the RNase III–type enzyme Drosha, yielding hairpin
structures (pre-miRNAs). Pre-miRNA hairpins are exported to the cytoplasm where they are
further processed into unstable miRNA duplexes by the RNase III protein Dicer. The less
stable of the two strands in the duplex is incorporated into a multiple-protein nuclease
complex, the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which regulates protein expression. In
mammalian cells, these RISCs, guided by the miRNA, interact with the 3’ UTR of target
mRNAs at regions exhibiting imperfect sequence homology, inhibiting protein synthesis by
a mechanism that has yet to be fully elucidated.
Although hundreds of miRNAs have been discovered in a variety of organisms, little is known
about their cellular function. Several unique physical attributes of miRNAs, including their
small size, lack of polyadenylated tails, and tendency to bind their mRNA targets with
imperfect sequence homology, have made them elusive and challenging to study.
Endogenously expressed miRNAs, including both intronic and intergenic miRNAs, are most
important in translational repression and in the regulation of development, especially the
timing of morphogenesis and the maintenance of undifferentiated or incompletely
differentiated cell types such as stem cells[21]. The role of endogenously expressed miRNA
in downregulating gene expression was first described in C. elegans in 1993 [25]. In plants
this function was discovered when the "JAW microRNA" of Arabidopsis was shown to be
involved in the regulation of several genes that control plant shape[22]. In plants, the
majority of genes regulated by miRNAs are transcription factors [23]; thus miRNA activity
is particularly wide-ranging and regulated entire gene networks during development by
modulating the expression of key regulatory genes, including transcription factors as well as
F-box_proteins[24]. In many organisms, including humans, miRNAs disruption have also
been linked to the formation of tumors and dysregulation of the cell cycle. Here, miRNAs

MicroRNA Identification Based on Bioinformatics Approaches

207

can function as both oncogenes and tumor suppressors[25]. Another example, miRNAs are
aberrantly expressed in: liver, pancreatic, oesophageal, stomach, colon, haematopoietic,
ovarian, breast, pituitary, prostate, thyroid, testicular and brain cancers[26] [27] [28] [29]
[30]; central nervous system disorders (e.g. schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s disease) [31]; and
cardiovascular disease[32] [33][36,37].
It is becoming clear that a comprehensive understanding of human biology must include
both small and large non-coding RNAs, and that it is perhaps only through inclusion of
these elements in the biomedical research agenda, including studies to determine the
mechanistic basis of the causative variations identified by genome-wide association studies,
that complex human diseases will be completely deciphered.

2. Computational methods
The discovery that microRNAs are synthesized as hairpin-containing precursors with
many shared features has stimulated the development of several computational
approaches to the discovery of new microRNA genes in various animal species. Many of
these approaches rely heavily on conservation of sequence within and between species,
while others emphasize machine learning methods to screen hairpin candidates for
structural features shared by known microRNA precursors. The identification of animal
microRNA targets is a particularly difficult problem because an exact match to the target
sequence is not required. We discuss the most recently devised algorithms for microRNA
and target discovery.
2.1 Machine learning approaches to miRNA discovery
Methods derived from the machine learning field have recently been applied to miRNA
discovery with good success. Machine mearning depends on the development of algorithms
and methods that allow a specific computer program to learn from data already collected on
verified miRNAs. These algorithms require a training set for the learning process that
consists of positive examples (that define the miRNA characteristics) and negative examples
(the control set of non-miRNA sequences). The known microRNAs used as positive
examples can be downloaded from the database miRBase [34, 35] and random sequences
can be one choice of negative set. One of the most important tasks associated with the
learning process is the identification of characteristics and the definition of the rules that
define the positive class. This is especially important in this case as these characteristics are
not always explicitly defined, Readers who wish to pursue machine learning in greater
detail may consult a recent review [36].
Examples of supervised machine learning algorithms include, naïve Bayes, support vector
machines (SVM), hidden Markov models (HMM), neural networks and the k-nearest
neighbor algorithm. Naïve Bayes is a classification model obtained by applying a relatively
simple method to a training dataset [37] A Naïve Bayes classifier calculates the probability
that a given instance (example) belongs to a certain class. Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
are widely used machine learning algorithms developed by Vapnik [38]. In this technique,
the numbers describing each feature of a microRNA are combined into a single vector in an
n-dimensional space. The algorithm compares the vectors from the positive class with those
from the negative class, and finds a "hyperplane" which produces the best separation
(margin) between the two classes. The "support vectors" are the samples from the two
classes which are closest together but still separable--they "support" the separating

208

hyperplane, (See Figure 1). The performance of this algorithm, as compared to other
algorithms, has proven to be particularly useful for the analysis of various classification
problems, particularly when the two classes are closely related or non-uniform, and has
recently been widely used in the bioinformatics field [39, 40].

2.2 MicroRNA discovery tools
Numerous computational approaches (in addition to machine learning) have been
implemented for miRNA gene prediction using methods based on sequence conservation
and/or structural similarity[41]; [42],[43] ; [44]; [45]. Some of these tools are listed in Table 1.
Lim and others [41] developed a program for identification of miRNAs, called MiRscan,
with 70% specificity at a sensitivity of 50%. MiRscan uses seven miRNA features with
associated weights to build a computational tool, which assigns scores to hairpin candidates.
The weights are estimated using statistics based on the previously known miRNAs from
C.elegans. Grad, et al., (2003), developed a computational method using sequence
conservation and structural similarity to predict miRNAs in the C.elegans genome. Lai, et al.,
(2003) used similar ideas to develop a different computational tool for the Drosophila
genome, called miRseeker. These efforts were previously reviewed by Bartel [46]. Others
have used homology searches for revealing paralog and ortholog miRNAs ([42]; [47]; [48];
[49]; [50]). Additionally, Wang and others[51] developed a method based on sequence and
structure alignment for miRNA identification.
ProMiR [52] is based on machine learning for miRNA discovery. ProMiR uses a highly
specific probabilistic model (HMM) whose topology and states are handcrafted based
on prior knowledge and assumptions, and whose exact probabilities are derived from the
accumulated data. Pfeffer, et al., (2005) used support vector machines (SVMs) for
predicting conserved miRNAs in herpesviruses. The features that defined the positive
class were extracted from the sequence and structure features in the stem loop to form the

MicroRNA Identification Based on Bioinformatics Approaches

209

positive class. The negative class was generated from mRNAs, rRNAs, or tRNAs from
human and viral genomes which should not include any miRNA sequences. The same
approach was also applied to analysis of clustered miRNAs [53] using a tool named mirabela, while Xue, et al.,(2005) developed a SVM classifier as a 2-class tool that does not
rely on comparative genomic approaches. They defined a negative class called pseudo
pre-miRNAs. The criteria for this negative class included a minimum of 18 paired bases, a
maximum of -15 kcal/mol folding free energy and no multiple loops. The tool is called
triplet-SVM. BayesMiRNAfind [54] is a machine learning approach based on the Naïve
Bayes classifier for predicting miRNA genes. This method differs from previous efforts in
two ways: 1) they generate the model automatically and identify rules based on the
miRNA gene structure and sequence, allowing prediction of non-conserved miRNAs and
2) they use a comparative analysis over multiple species to reduce the false positive rate.
This allows for a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. The resulting algorithm
demonstrates higher specificity and similar sensitivity to algorithms that use conserved
genomic regions to reduce false positives [41, 43-45]. Grundhoff, et al.,(2006) have
developed an approach to identify miRNAs that is based on bioinformatics and arraybased technologies. The bioinformatics tool, VMir [55], does not rely on evolutionary
sequence conservation. RNAmicro [56] is another miRNA prediction tool developed by
Hertel and Stadler that relies mainly on comparative sequence analysis rather then
structural features using two-class SVM.
Sheng, et al.,(2007) describe a computational method, mirCoS [57], that applies three
support vector machine models, based on sequence, secondary structure, and
conservation, sequentially to discover new conserved miRNA candidates in mammalian
genomes.
Defining the negative class is a major challenge in developing machine learning algorithms
for miRNA discovery. Two machine learning approaches have recently appeared for
identifying microRNAs without the necessity of defining a negative class. Yousef, et al.,
(2008) presented a study using one-class machine learning for microRNA using only
positive data to build the classifier (One-ClassMirnaFind [58]). Several different classifiers,
including two classes SVM were used to compare the one-class approach to the
corresponding two-class methods. Although the two-class procedure was generally found to
be superior, it was more complex to implement.
Xu, et al., (2008) recently developed a tool called miRank. MiRank [59] is a novel ranking
algorithm based on a random walk through a graph consisting of known miRNA examples
and unknown candidate sequences. Each miRNA is a vertex connected to its neighbor by an
edge which is weighted by its similarity of the miRNA features. The score or relevance of a
vertex increases with the number of its connections. The vertices are then ranked by
relevance score, and an arbitrary cutoff of the ranked list includes both the positive
examples and the most similar of the predicted unknowns. The strength of miRank is its
ability to identify novel miRNAs in newly sequenced genomes where there are few
annotated miRNAs (positive examples). The authors found miRank to be superior to SVM
classifiers, and attribute its success to the fact that it structures the list and ranks the
candidate examples as well as the query sequences during the training and classification
steps.
We should note in passing that high-throughput methods for sequencing isolated small
RNAs provide a new tool for discovering new microRNA species [60] and a new method
for amplifying low-concentration microRNAs allows easier testing of predictions [61] .

3. Target identification
Although recent findings [63] suggest MicroRNAs may affect gene expression by binding to
either 5’ or 3’ untranslated regions of messenger RNA, most studies have found that
microRNA mark their target mRNAs for degradation or suppress their translation by binding
to the 3’-untranslated region (3’UTR) and most target programs search there . These studies
have suggested that the microRNA seed segment which includes 6-8 nucleotides at the 5’ end
of the mature miRNA sequence is very important in the selection of the target site (see
Figure 2). Thus, most of the computational tools developed to identify mRNA target sequences
depend heavily on complementarity between the miRNA seed sequence and the target
sequence. Diana-microT [64] was one of the first computational tools for target prediction that
identified specific interaction rules based on bioinformatics and experimental approaches.
The tool successfully recovered all validated C. elegans miRNA targets
Several additional methods for the prediction of miRNA targets have been subsequently
developed. These methods mainly use sequence complementarities, thermodynamic
stability calculations, and evolutionary conservation among species to determine the
likelihood of a productive miRNA:mRNA duplex formation [46, 65]. John et al., (2004)
developed the miRanda [66] algorithm for miRNA target prediction. MiRanda uses
dynamic programming to search for optimal sequence complementarities between a set of
mature microRNAs and a given mRNA MicroRNA.org (http://www.microrna.org) [67]
is a comprehensive resource of microRNA target predictions and miRNA expression
profiles. Target predictions are based on the miRanda algorithm while miRNA
expression profiles are derived from a comprehensive sequencing project of a large set of
mammalian tissues and cell lines of normal and disease origin. Another algorithm
RNAhybrid [68] [69] is similar to a RNA secondary structure prediction algorithm like
the Mfold program [70] but it determines the most favorable hybridization site between
two sequences.
Bennecke and others [71] have recently suggested that the 3’ out-seed segment of the
miRNA:mRNA duplex can compensate for imperfect base pairing of the target with the seed
segment and a recent computational approach [72] has considered the contributions of both
seed and the out-seed miRNA segments in target identification. Using sequence

MicroRNA Identification Based on Bioinformatics Approaches

conservation reduces false positive predictions but as a result some less-conserved targetsites may be missed. This presents a dilemma, which is how to avoid rejection of these less
highly conserved target sites while still reducing the very large numbers of predictions that
are found when seed region conservation in the target is not required. In order to reduce the
false positive predictions inherent in methods that heavily weight specific target sequence
conservation, Lewis, et al.,(2005) developed TargetScanS [73]. TargetScanS scores target sites
based on the conservation of the target sequences between five genomes (human, mouse,
rat, dog and chicken) as evolutionarily conserved target sequences are more likely to be true
targets. In testing, TargetScanS was able to recover targets for all 5300 human genes known
at the time to be targeted by miRNAs.
PicTar [74] is a computational method to detect common miRNA targets in vertebrates, C.
elegans, and Drosophila. PicTar is based on a statistical method applied to eight vertebrate
genome-wide alignments (multiple alignments of orthologous nucleotide sequences (3'
UTRs) ). PicTar was able to recover validated miRNA targets at an estimated 30%
false-positive rate. In a separate study PicTar was applied to target identification in
Drosophila melanogaster [75] . These studies suggest that one miRNA can target 54 genes
on average and that known microRNAs are projected to regulate a large fraction of all D.
melanogaster genes (15%). This is likely to be a conservative estimate due to the incomplete
input data.
TargetBoost [76] is a machine learning algorithm for miRNA target prediction using only
sequence information to create weighted sequence motifs that capture the binding
characteristics between microRNAs and their targets. The authors suggest that TargetBoost
is stable and identifies more of the already verified true targets than do other existing
algorithms.
Sung-Kyu, et al., (2005), also reported the development of a machine learning algorithm
using SVM. The best reported results [77] were 0.921 sensitivity and 0.833 specificity. More
recent Yan and others, used a machine learning approach that employs features extracted
from both the seed and out-seed segments [72]. The best result obtained was an accuracy of
82.95% but it was generated using only 48 positive human and 16 negative examples, a
relatively small training set to assess the algorithm.
In 2006, Thadani and Tammi [78] launched MicroTar, a novel statistical computational tool
for prediction of miRNA targets from RNA duplexes which does not use sequence
homology for prediction. MicroTar mainly relies on a quite novel approach to estimate the
duplex energy. However, the reported sensitivity (60%) is significantly lower than that
achieved using other published algorithms. At the same time, a microRNA pattern
discovery method, RNA22 [79] was proposed to scan UTR sequences for targets . RNA22
does not rely upon cross-species conservation but was able to recover most of the known
target sites with validation of some of its new predictions.
More recently, Yousef, et al.,(2007) described a target prediction method, (NBmiRTar [80])
using instead machine learning by a Naïve Bayes classifier. NBmiRTar does not require
sequence conservation but generates a model from sequence and miRNA:mRNA duplex
information derived from validated target sequences and artificially generated negative
examples. In this case, both the seed and “out-seed” segments of the miRNA:mRNA duplex
are used for target identification. NBmiRTar technique produces fewer false positive
predictions and fewer target candidates to be tested than miRanda [66]. It exhibits higher
sensitivity and specificity than algorithms that rely only on conserved genomic regions to
decrease false positive predictions.

Table 2. MicroRNA Target prediction tools
In a 2004 review Lai [65] noted that there is almost no overlap among the predicted targets
identified by the various methods and suggested that each tool captures a subset of the
entire target class as a function of the specific features they have incorporated into their
prediction models. More recently, Sethupathy, et al., (2006) conducted a comparison of the 5
most used tools for mammalian target prediction. This study indicated that 30% of the
experimentally validated target sites are nonconserved, supporting the need for the
development of different or complementary computational approaches to capture new
target sites. Furthermore, the large number of predictions that each of these tools is
producing suggests that the heavy reliance on homology or comparative sequence analysis
is not sufficient to generate accurate predictions with a high sensitivity and there are yet to
be identified recognition parameters that must be considered.

4. Databases for microRNA and targets
There is a variety of very useful databases that provide a significant amount of
information on miRNA and Target predictions,(Table 3). The most extensive database for
both miRNA and target sequences is miRBase[34]. MiRBase contains both miRNA mature
sequences, hairpin sequences of precursors and associated annotation. Release 12.0 of the
database contains 8619 entries representing hairpin precursor miRNAs, expressing 8273
mature miRNA products, in primates, rodents, birds, fish, worms, flies, plants and
viruses. MiRBase also contains predicted miRNA target genes in miRBase Targets, and
provides a gene naming and nomenclature function in the miRBase Registry. The miRNA
target genes are predicted by the miRanda tool [66] and not necessarily experimentally
validated.
TarBase [81] contains a set of experimentally supported targets in different species that are
collected manually from the literature. TarBase version 5 has more than 1300 experimentally
supported miRNA target interactions. The database has information about the target site
described by the duplex of miRNA and gene. It also includes information on the
experiments that were conducted to test the target, the sufficiency of the site to induce
translational repression and/or cleavage, and a reference to the paper used to extract the
information.
Argonaute [82] is a compilation of comprehensive information on mammalian miRNAs,
their origin and regulated target genes in an exhaustively curated database. The source
information of Argonaute is from both literature and other databases.

Motif Discovery with Compact Approaches Design and Applications
Cinzia Pizzi
University of Padova
Italy
1. Introduction
In the post-genomic era, the ability to predict the behavior, the function, or the structure of
biological entities (such as genes and proteins), as well as interactions among them, plays
a fundamental role in the discovery of information to help biologists to explain biological
mechanisms.
In this context, appropriate characterization of the structures under analysis, and the
exploitation of combinatorial properties of sequences, are crucial steps towards the
development of efﬁcient algorithms and data structures to be able to perform the analysis
of biological sequences.
Several functional and structural properties, and also evolutionary mechanisms, can be
predicted either by the comparison of new elements with already classiﬁed elements, or by
the comparison elements with a similar structure of function to infer the common mechanism
that is at the basis of the observed similar behavior. Such elements are commonly called motifs.
Comparison-based methods for sequence analysis ﬁnd their application in several biological
contexts, such as extraction of transcription factor binding sites, identiﬁcation of structural
and functional similarities in proteins, and phylogeny reconstruction. Therefore, the
development of adequate methodologies for motif discovery is of undoubt interests for
several different ﬁelds in computational biology.
In motif discovery in biosequences, it is common to assume that statistically signiﬁcant
candidates are those that are likely to hide some biologically signiﬁcant property. For this
purpose all the possible candidates are ranked according to some statistics on words. Then
they are presented in output for further inspection that need to be carried out by a biologist,
who identiﬁes the most promising patterns. These, in turn, are tested in laboratory to conﬁrm
their biological signiﬁcance. Therefore, when designing algorithms for motif discovery,
besides obviously aim at time and space efﬁciency, particular attention should be devoted
to the output representation. In fact, even considering ﬁxed length strings, the size of the
candidate set becomes exponential if exhaustive enumeration is applied. This is already true
when only exact matches are considered as candidate occurrences, and worsen when the
intrinsic variability of biological sequences is taken into account.
Alternatively to methods based on exhaustive enumeration, heuristics could be used.
However, heuristics cannot guarantee to ﬁnd the optimal solution. Therefore some degree

218

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental
Systems

of uncertainty remains whether motifs, that are statistically as signiﬁcant as those reported in
output, have been left out.
Computational power of nowadays computers can partially reduce the effects of exhaustive
enumeration approaches, in particular for short length candidates. However, if the size of the
output is too big to be analyzed by human inspection the risk is to provide biologists with
very fast tools that produce mostly useless output.
A possible solution to these problems relies on compact approaches. Compact approaches are
based on the partition of the search space into classes.
The ﬁnal user can then be presented with an output that has the size of the partition, rather
than the size of the candidate space, with obvious advantages for the human-based analysis
that follows the computer-based ﬁltering of the pattern discovery algorithms.
Compact approaches ﬁnd applications both in searching and discovery frameworks. They
can also be applied to several motif models: exact patterns, approximate patterns, position
matrices, etc. And under both independent and identically distribution (i.i.d.) and Markov
distributions.
The purpose of this chapter is to describe the basis of compact approaches, to provide the
readers with the conceptual tools for applying compact approaches to the design of their
algorithm for biosequence analysis. This will be achieved by overwieving examples of
compact approaches that have been successfully developed for several motif models that will
be illustrated with the sustain of examples and experiments to discuss their power.

2. Background
The methodologies to study the Science of Life dramatically changed during the past years.
The advent of the web made it possible for the scientiﬁc community to share the massive
quantity of data produced by high throughput techniques, thus accelerating the analysis of
the available data and the discovery of related properties and associations. The development
of high throughput technologies has as a consequence not only an increase in the amount
of data, but also a diversiﬁcation of the type of data available, opening new perspectives of
investigations. Disciplines such as Bioinformatics and Computational Biology try to combine
the efforts and competency of the communities of biologists and computer scientists in a
single more powerful combination of human knowledge and efﬁciency, thanks to automatic
approaches to data analysis.
2.1 De¿nition of the problem

One of the key aspects in the analysis of biological sequences is the identiﬁcation of interesting
patterns. “Interestingness” is a wide concept that may embrace very different deﬁnitions
depending on the contexts in which the analysis is carried out. At an higher level we can
deﬁne an interesting pattern as a pattern that shows an unusual behavior from what it is
expected in terms of presence within the sequence under analysis.
More in details, searching for shared or over-represented patterns is motivated by a simple
commonly accepted principle: if two or more sequences perform the same functions or have
the same structure, then the common elements among the sequences might be somehow
responsible for the observed similarity.
The problem of ﬁnding biologically signiﬁcant patterns is then moved to the problem of
ﬁnding statistically signiﬁcant patterns.

Table 1. Various choices to model motifs in biological sequences. Starting from solid words
the level of sensibility increases (allowing for variations), but the level of speciﬁcity
consequently decreases, thus making more difﬁcult the process of detection of the signal.
The problem of searching for similar regions among biological sequences faces several issues.
First of all, the genetic code must be fault-tolerant to deal with errors that may occur during
transcription or are due to random mutations, so that an intrinsic variability characterizes
biological motifs. This variability has as a consequence the possible explosion of the size of
the search space under study, due to the rich underlying combinatorics. Searching the whole
pattern space then is feasible only for very short patterns. Note that this is also true for exact
words, because their number increases exponentially with the length. On the other hand,
heuristics are not guaranteed to ﬁnd a globally optimal solution.
A critical step of the process is the choice of an appropriate structure to model the motifs.
In some cases, deterministic patterns do not have enough expressive power to describe the
speciﬁcity of the contributions of each symbol in any position of the site. Statistical matrices
or graph-based models might offer a better framework in these cases. Several options have
been considered during the past decades to model signals in biosequences, and to take into
account for this intrinsic variability. Some of these models of choice are listed in Table 1, sorted
in increasing order of expressive power (and consequent increase of difﬁculty in the design of
related algorithm, and of their intrinsic complexity).
The choice of an appropriate model to describe motifs is a trade-off between the
expressiveness of the model to describe particular biological properties, and the efﬁciency
of the algorithms that can be applied when that model is chosen.
The scoring function chosen to evaluate the output also plays an important role in the
identiﬁcation of the searched sites. However, simple statistics are often unable to discriminate
interesting motifs from motifs that are likely to occur by chance, so that different measures of
statistical signiﬁcance need to be considered. In summary, for a given choice of a statistical
measure S of a motif m, one could ask three questions:
• What is the value of S (m)?
• How surprising is to measure S (m) with respect to the value that was expected according
to some background distribution?
• How likely is it for the recorded values to occur by chance?
These three questions can be answered by the means of different computations. The ﬁrst one,
for example, can be answered by exact counts or estimates. To answer the second, we need
some score that measures over-representation, such as the z-score. Finally the third one is solved
by resort to so called p-value of a statistic.
Once the model and the scoring function have been ﬁxed, the next step is the development
of efﬁcient approaches to extract the searched information. There is a vast literature about

220

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental
Systems

algorithms for motif discovery. However, most of them either have been developed to solve
very speciﬁc instances of the problem, such as the Motif Challenge Problem (Pevzner & Sze,
2000), or are based on exhaustive search of the pattern space (among which (Queen et al.,
1982; Staden, 1989; Tompa, 1999; van Helden et al., 1998; Waterman et al., 1984)), or rely on
heuristics (for example (Hertz & Stormo, 1999; Stormo & III, 1989)). Comparison of several
techniques in fact showed how performances substantially depend on the underlying model
of the motif to discover (Tompa et al., 2005).

3. Compact scoring
Despite the intrinsic possible explosion of the size of the search space, it is possible to conceive
a compact representation of the patterns such that only representative patterns are scored, and
no critical information is lost in the process.
The classes must be designed in such a way that the score used to rank the candidates has
a monotone behavior within each class. This allows the identiﬁcation of a representative of
each class, which is the element with the highest score. Consequently, it sufﬁces to compute,
and to report in output, only the score for the representatives. In fact, we are guaranteed that
for each element that has not been ranked there is another one (the representative of the class
it belongs to) that is at least as signiﬁcant.
In such a framework, the output size would depend upon the number of classes in which
patterns can be grouped, rather than on all the existing patterns that belong to the search
space. This approach can also be used as a ﬁlter to detect unusual classes of strings that need
to be scrutinized further.
The compact scoring needs two important steps to be carried out with critical attention:
1. deﬁnition of the search space
2. efﬁcient partitioning
The deﬁnition of the search space clearly depends implicitly on the motif model, as discussed
above. Nevertheless there are also two working frameworks in which one can pose his search
(Brazma et al., 1998).
In the pattern-driven framework the search space consists of all possible patterns (of a given
size) that can be generated over a given alphabet Σ. The input sequence is then tested for
occurrences of each and every motif in a family of a priori generated, abstract models (for
example (Keich & Pevzner, 2002)). Although more correct in principle, this method may pose
severe computational issues.
In the sequence-driven framework the search space consists of strings that actually occur
at least once in the given input, or to some more or less controlled neighborhood of those
substrings (for example (Lawrence et al., 1993)). This may be less ﬁrm methodologically, but
leads to time and space savings.
The choice of techniques and data structures that can be used to perform the partition are
strictly related to the deﬁnition of the model and search space. In turn they affect the space
complexity reduction that can be achieved by the partitioning, as it will be clear in the
following discussion.

4. Solid words
In this section we describe a methodology for compact representation and scoring of single
solid words, and pairs of solid words. We will outline the basic concepts used in the approach.
Details of formulas and proofs of theorems can be found in (Apostolico et al., 2003).
4.1 Compact indexes for single words

Let us consider the problem of extracting frequent substrings from a string x of length n. The
number of substrings in x is equal to the number of possible choices of starting and ending
indexes that univocally identify the substring. These are obviously O(n2 ). There are several
observations that can be done with respect to this output size:
• for very long strings (consider genome wide analysis) the computation of all the
occurrences of all these substrings might become prohibitive in terms of both time and
space needed;
• the list of candidates might be too long to allow deep inspection by the ﬁnal user;
• some substrings, of increasing length, occur the same number of times and in the same
exact position: the output set might hide some notable redundancy.
In order to overcome these issues a compact approach might be applied. The compact
representation and scoring of solid words can be achieved by exploiting the characteristics of
appropriate data structures, such as the sufﬁx tree, and by an in-depth analysis of the properties
of monotonicity for some measure of over- or under-representation.
4.1.1 Suf¿x trees

A sufﬁx tree is a data structure used to efﬁciently store and retrieve information about all
the substrings of a given text. Given a text x of length n deﬁned over an alphabet Σ, and a
symbol $ ∈
/ Σ, the sufﬁx tree associated with x is the digital search trie of all the sufﬁxes of
x. There are two versions of sufﬁx tree: the expandend sufﬁx tree (also called sufﬁx trie), and
the compact sufﬁx tree. In the expanded version each arc is labelled with a symbol, except
for the leaves that are labelled with the corresponding sufﬁx. The space required to store an
expanded sufﬁx tree is O(n2 ) in the worst case (Aho et al., 1974). On the other hand, in the
compact representation chains of nodes with one outgoing edge are collapsed together in a
single arc. The symbol $ guarantees that each node in the compact sufﬁx tree (except the
leaf nodes) is branching. This property, together with the observation that there are n leaves,
corresponding to the n sufﬁxes, implies that there are O(n ) nodes in the sufﬁx tree. Each arc
is labeled with two indexes, the start and the end positions of the corresponding substring
in the text (or, equivalently, the start position and the length of the path from the root node
to the node at which the arc ends). With such a representation, the overall space needed
to store a compact sufﬁx tree is O(n ). The brute force construction of a sufﬁx tree requires
O(n2 ) time. However, more clever algorithms allow for linear time construction of the tree
(McCreight, 1976; Ukkonen, 1995; Weiner, 1973). The word spelled by a path from the root to
a node α is indicated with w(α), and α is called the proper locus of w(α). The locus of a word
w is the unique node β of the sufﬁx tree such that w is a proper preﬁx of β, and f ather ( β) is
a proper preﬁx of w. The frequency of a word w can be obtained in time proportional to the
length of w and to the number of its occurrences. For this purpose we reach the locus β of

222

6

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental
Systems
Will-be-set-by-IN-TECH

w and then visit the subtree rooted at β to count the number of its leaves. Alternatively, one
could annotate the nodes of the tree in a bottom-up fashion with the count of their children.
Then, to know the frequency of any query word w, only the time to reach its locus is needed.
Alternatively to the sufﬁx tree, one could use a sufﬁx array (Manber & Myers, 1993). As it is
shown in (Abouelhoda et al., 2004) these two data structures are equivalent. The advantage
of the sufﬁx array is that it usually takes less space. This comes at expenses of an increase of
the difﬁculty in the designing of related algorithms.
4.1.2 Example
n ( n +1)

= 66
For a string x = AGCTAGCTAAA of length 11, the number of substrings is
2
(number of choices of starting and ending position for a substring). In the speciﬁc case of the
string in our example, if we remove duplications there will remain 52 different substrings. By
building the sufﬁx tree (see Fig.1), and considering only the strings corresponding to nodes
the number of candidates reduces to 15.

indicates the corresponding sufﬁx in x, i.e. their starting position.
4.1.3 Compact representation for the frequency of single words

An interesting property of the sufﬁx tree is that all the words that end within an arc have the
same frequency, equal to the frequency of the word corresponding to their locus. Thus a sufﬁx
tree partitions the Θ (n2 ) subwords of a text in O(n ) classes, such that the words that belong
to the same class have the same locus. Take, for example, the strings “C”, “CT”, and “CTA”
in the sufﬁx tree of Fig.1. They all occur at positions 3 and 7 in x, as it can be easily veriﬁed
by eye inspection of the string. Therefore they start at the same positions in the text, and have
the same frequency.
The word w( β), corresponding to the locus β of the class Cβ can be considered as maximal in
length, since any extension of w( β) will have a different frequency, and thus would not belong
to the class Cβ . These words are called representatives.
In Table 2 we enumerate all the classes identiﬁed by the partition induced by the sufﬁx tree of
Fig.1.
The compact output related to the frequency analysis of the substrings of x is represented by
the following Table 3. It is easy to note by eye inspection that this output gives a much clearer
and immediate representation of the frequency distribution of substrings of x with respect to
a full enumeration of all 66 possible substrings in it.

Table 3. The compact output for the frequency count of the substrings in x.
4.1.4 Compact representation for single words statistics

In some kind of analysis the frequency count might be insufﬁcient to extract “interesting”
patterns, since some of them might occur often simply by chance. In these cases an evaluation
of over- or under- representation can give a better solution to the problem of the extraction
of interesting patterns. It has been shown in (Apostolico et al., 2003) that the compact
approach can be extended to over-representation scores, such as z-scores. Z-scores have
the characteristic to compare the counted frequency with the frequency expected assuming
f
f −e
a given background distribution. Some examples are e , f − e, e , where f and e are the
counted and expected frequency respectively.
The partition induced by the sufﬁx tree is such that the words that belong to a class are
preﬁxes of increasing length of the representative substring. The expected frequency of words
decreases with word length. We show this with a simple example. Consider the case of i.i.d.
hypothesis, with an uniform distribution, i.e. all the symbols in the alphabet have the same

224

probability p to occur. The probability of a word of length l is then pl . Since 0 < p < 1,
we have that the term pl decreases with l. The reasoning can be extended and proved for a
general distribution and under both i.i.d. and Markov chain hypothesis.
Within each class two conditions hold:
1. the counted frequency is constant;
2. the expected frequency is monotonically decreasing and reach its minimum at the
representative.
Hence z-scores with a constant frequency f and decreasing frequency e will have
a monotonically increasing behavior within each class, and reach their maximum in
correspondence of the representative of the class. Using over-representation to extract
interesting patterns allows to use a threshold to ﬁltering the results further. The threshold can
be arbitrarily ﬁxed (for example we are interested in patterns that occur at least the double of
what we expect), or by ﬁxing a p-value (that it is a probability of seeing a pattern by chance)
and computing the corresponding absolute threshold for the score (Staden, 1989).
f
In Table 4 we can see an example of compact output of the z-score e , for a uniform distribution
and for a general distribution. We still refer to the string x of the previous examples. It can be
seen that the two background distribution produce a slightly different order in the output, and
a quite different score associated to the strings. By setting a threshold Th = 1000 we obtain
a further reduction of the output size that in the case of the uniform distribution maintains 9
strings, while in the case of the considered general distribution it maintains 12 strings.

Table 4. The compact output for the over-representation score of the substrings in x. In the
ﬁrst two columns the substrings are scored according to a uniform distribution. In the last
two columns the substrings are scored according to the following distribution:

4.2 Compact indexes for co-occurrences

The sufﬁx tree property of partitioning the set of substrings of a string in O(n ) classes can be
exploited also for the computation of co-occurrences between substrings of an input string.
In (Apostolico et al., 2004) the compact approach was extended to the efﬁcient computation
of a table to hold the number of co-occurrences of substrings within a text. In this context

the problem is: given two words y and z, and a distance d, compute the number of times
that z follows y at a distance at most d. In (Apostolico et al., 2004) further restrictions
were set so that z must follow an occurrence of y but it must occur before the next
occurrences of y. Moreover, if many occurrences of z are found at the right side of the
same occurrence of y, only the closest one is counted. In Fig.2 it can be seen how the
co-occurrence count can vary. A simple count, without restriction would give a value of 4:
{( pi , q k ), ( pi , q k+1 ), ( pi , q k+2 ), ( pi+1 , q k+2 )}. If no interleaving occurrences of y are allowed the
count would reduce to 3: {( pi , q k ), ( pi , q k+1 ), ( pi+1 , q k+2 )}. If also no interleaving occurrences
of z are allowed the count would drop to 2: {( pi , q k ), ( pi+1 , q k+2 )}.

A naive approach would count the number of co-occurrences between all O(n2 ) substrings of
x, thus requiring O(n4 ) time and space. In contexts other than bioinformatics some algorithms
have been developed, on related, even though more general problems (Arimura et al., 2000;
Wang et al., 1994). However, they can also solve the given problem in time O(d2 n3 log n ) and
O(n3 ) respectively. Here we focus on the description of the algorithm in (Apostolico et al.,
2004) that solves the problem of computing the simple frequency. Eliminating multiple
occurrences in fact comes at no extra cost but also does not change the space complexity,
that is the focus of compact approaches.
The algorithm exploits the sufﬁx tree property described in Sec. 4.1.3 to partition the O(n2 )
substrings in an O(n ) classes corresponding to the nodes, and computes the co-occurrence
count only for words corresponding to node pairs. The key observation is that if a pair (y , z )
is left out, then the following conditions hold:
1. there exists already a corresponding pair (y, z) such that y and z are preﬁxes of y and z
respectively;
2. the score of (y, z) is at least equal to the score of (y , z ).
These facts follow from the property of the sufﬁx tree that all the substrings ending within
an arc have the same starting positions of the string corresponding to their locus. Since the
distance d is measured from the beginning of the ﬁrst component, this implies that classes of
substrings that share the same set of starting positions will occur, within distance d, the same
number of times. Again, the strings corresponding to the proper loci of the sufﬁx tree can be
selected as representative of the classes, and indexed. In Fig.3 the pair ( ACG, T ) co-occurs the
same number of times of the pair ( ACGTA, TA).
There are O(n ) nodes in the sufﬁx tree, and each of them can be chosen as ﬁrst component.
A second sufﬁx tree is used to store the number of co-occurrences between the ﬁxed ﬁrst
component, and all other nodes in the sufﬁx tree. The annotation is made as follows:
1. assign a null weight to all nodes of the sufﬁx tree used for the counting of co-occurrences
2. let y be the ﬁrst ﬁxed component, and { p1 . . . pk } its set of occurrences;

4. annotate the tree bottom-up, so that internal nodes have a weight corresponding to the
sum of the weights of their children.
After the annotation the sufﬁx tree will hold the number of co-occurrences between the ﬁxed
y and any string z with a proper locus in the tree. The annotation of the tree is performed in
linear time. Since this must be repeated for every possible choice of the ﬁrst component y, the
resulting complexity is O(n2 ).
4.2.1 Example

Turning back at the example in the previous section, the co-occurrences will be counted only
for 15 × 15 = 225 pairs of substrings of x. If an exhaustive index would have been build
instead, the number of entries of the output would have been 4356, or 2704 if duplication was
removed. In the former case we achieved a 95% reduction of the table size, in the latter a 92%
reduction.

5. Compact approaches for words with mismatches
Co-occurrence counts are useful for the detection of motifs that are particularly conserved
at the sides and allow for high variability in the middle, i.e. so called dyads. However,
other distributions of variability are possible and compact approaches to deal with them have
also been developed. However, dealing directly with variability implies an higher order of
complexity in the solution of the problem. It is possible to identify in literature two main
frameworks in which compact approaches have been developed:
1. the candidate motifs occur at least once exactly in the input string; the errors (mismatches)
can occur in any position of the motifs;
2. the candidate motifs might never occur in the input string exactly; the position of the errors
(wildcards) are ﬁxed in the motif template.
5.1 Compact approaches for motif with mismatches

In (Apostolico & Pizzi, 2007) a compact approach for the extraction of motifs with mismatches,
with an i.i.d. background, was proposed. The approach was next extended to deal with a

markovian background distribution (Pizzi & Bianco, 2009). The assumptions are that: the
motif must occur at least once exactly in the sequences; its instances can appear with exactly,
or at most, k mismatches; the mismatches can occur in any position of the motif.
We ﬁrst observe that, because of the introduction of mismatches, it is not possible to use
a sufﬁx tree to partition the search space. In fact if we consider a string w with exactly
k mismatches, and its extension wa, with a ∈ Σ, with exactly k mismatches we are not
guaranteed that the frequency of wa is the same of w, even if both have the same locus. In
fact, in the count of wa with k mismatches we would add the number of occurrences of w with
k mismatches followed by an a, and the number of occurrences of w with k − 1 mismatches
followed by a symbol b = a, and ﬁnally subtract the number of occurrences of w with k
mismatches followed by a symbol b = a. Depending on how the symbols occur in the text the
number of occurrences of wa might be less, equal, or greater than those of w.
Hence, to compact the output, one has to isolate intervals of words of increasing length with
the same frequency (with mismatches. However, this is not sufﬁcient. The next step is to
verify that within those intervals the expectation with mismatches has indeed a monotone
behavior.
In (Apostolico & Pizzi, 2007; 2008), besides the proposal of polynomial algorithms for the
computation of the expected frequency, a full study about the score behavior of motifs with
mismatches has been presented. We redirect the readers to the original papers for proofs and
report here only the main results.
1. the word length is increased, and the number of mismatches is ﬁxed: the expected
frequency with mismatches decreases;
2. the number of mismatches is increased, keeping the word length ﬁxed, counting an exact
number of mismatches: the expected frequency with mismatches increases (at least until a
number of mismatches equal to half of the length of the motif, then it might decrease);
3. the number of mismatches is increased, keeping the word length ﬁxed, counting at most a
given number of mismatches: the expected frequency with mismatches increases.
The case 1) is that of interest for the intervals of increasing length and constant counted
frequency with mismatches. In fact, in these intervals we have that the z-scores are monotone,
and we can take as a representative of the interval the corresponding string.
Experiments to measure the effectiveness of the interval deﬁnition can be carried out in the
following way. Let us consider words of length m ± δ, for a given m and δ and compute the
score for runs of words with the same frequency (with mismatches) only once.
Tables 5 and 6 report the percentage of entry savings, with respect to a full enumeration, when
the frequency is counted for exactly or at most k mismatches respectively. The input string was
a sample 10k bases from the yeast genome.
5.2 Compact approaches for words with wildcards

In case of regular patterns the words are deﬁned over an alphabet Σ = Σ ∪ {“.”} that includes
also the wildcard “." symbol. The classes of equivalence are identiﬁed by the subwords that are
generated by the corresponding grammars. Moreover, the property of maximality must hold
both in length and in composition. A pattern is maximal in composition if the substitution of
any of its wildcards with a given symbol of the alphabet Σ alters the number of occurrences
of the pattern. Maximal regular patterns have been used to devise combinatorial algorithms

Table 6. Average run length and table size reductions for frequency with at most k

for the detection of frequent patterns in biosequences (Califano, 2000; Rigoutsos & Floratos,
1998). In both works, the extracted patterns can be said to be a compact representation for
motifs in which variability is allowed, but only at speciﬁc positions.
Although the number of maximal motifs with wildcard can be exponential, in (Parida et al.,
2000) the authors present a way of extracting the inner structure that characterize such type
of motif so that the output size could be further reduced. This can be obtained by deﬁning a
basis of motifs. A basis B is a subset of all the motifs from which it is possible to recover all the
other motifs. More in details a motif is characterized by its list of occurrences, and all motifs
not in the basis can be obtained by a combination of the location lists of some of the motifs in
B. The motifs that belong to the basis are called irredundant. Several works have been done
on such motif representation, among which (Apostolico & Parida, 2004; Pelfrêne et al., 2003;
Ukkonen, 2009). In (Apostolico, Parida & Rombo, 2008) the concept of irredundant basis was
further extended to 2D patterns.
In the context of patterns with wildcards, a pattern is taken into consideration if it occurs for
a number of time that is deﬁned by a quorum q ≥ 2. In (Pisanti et al., 2005) an in dept study
about the complexity of the number of irredundant motif showed that there exists a family of
motifs for which the number of motifs in the basis is Ω(n2 ) for q = 2. In the same paper the
authors propose a new deﬁnition for a basis, that is stronger than that in (Parida et al., 2000).
Therefore their basis is smaller and included in the previous one. Motifs that belong to the

13

new deﬁnition are called tiling. For basis on tiling motifs the number of elements is linear in
the size of the input string for q = 2. However, it has been proved that for all basis there is an
exponential dependency in the quorum when q > 2, so that no polynomial algorithm exists
to extract a basis in this case.
Basis are clearly a compact representation of the motifs space, hence a powerful tool for
the analysis of biological sequences when variability is taken into account in the form of
wildcards.

6. Position weight matrices
Positions weight matrices are one of the most widely used models for biological signals, being
used both in genomic and proteomic studies.
A position weight matrix is a scoring matrix M, where each row represents a position and each
column a symbol from the alphabet Σ (in literature it is common to ﬁnd also the vice versa).
The score of the matrix against a segment x j x j+1 . . . x j+m−1 of a sequence x = x1 x2 . . . xn , is
given by:
S ( M, j ) =

m −1

∑

i =0

M [i ][ x j+i ]

Given a threshold T, the matrix M is said to have an hit at position j of x if S ( M, j) ≥ T.
The threshold can be given as an absolute value or as a p-value or MSS score T  , and then
converted in terms of absolute score with respect to the matrix M (Staden, 1989).
The hits of a matrix M in the sequence x can be found naively by an O(mn ) algorithm that
for each position j check if S ( M, j) is above the threshold. The computation of the score takes
O(m) steps, and need to be computed for n − m + 1 possible starting positions, hence the
claimed complexity.
6.1 The look-ahead technique

The look-ahead technique (Wu et al., 2000) can be used to stop the computation of the
score whenever one is sure that the threshold will never be reached. Let Sk ( M, j) =
∑ im=−k1+1 M [i ][ x j+i ] be the score of the segment x j . . . x j+k−1 with respect to the matrix M, the
condition to stop the comparison is:
Sk ( M, j) +

m −1

∑

i = k +1

max M [i ][ s] < T
s ∈Σ

i.e. even if in the rest of the comparison we will add the maximum score of the matrix for
those positions, the ﬁnal score will be below the threshold.
It is easy to compute an array tla of size m that holds the value of the partial thresholds that
need to be reached in order to have the chance to reach the threshold. The entries of the array
are given by:
tla [i ] = T − Sk ( M, i + 1)
These can be computed in linear time in m, by setting tla [ m − 1] = T, and recursively
computing the other entries by the formula:

230

14

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental
Systems
Will-be-set-by-IN-TECH

tla [i ] = tla [i + 1] − max M [i + 1][ s], for i = m − 2 . . . 0
s ∈Σ

6.2 The Minimum Gain

A dual concept to that of look-ahead score is given by the Minimum Gain (Pizzi et al., 2011).
The minimum gain relative to a position j in the matrix is the minimum score that can be
obtained by summing the scores from positions j + 1 to m.
The minimum gain can be used similarly to look-ahead to stop the comparison of the matrix
against a segment earlier. In this case the condition to be veriﬁed is:
Sk ( M, j) +

m −1

∑

i = k +1

min M [i ][ s] ≥ T
s ∈Σ

If this is the case, then no matter what the following m − k symbols are, there will be a hit to
report at position j.
Similarly to look-ahead, we can build a minimum gain array tmg corresponding to the partial
thresholds that need to be reached to ensure that the hit. Starting from tmg [ m − 1] = 0, we
have:
tmg [i ] = tmg [i + 1] − min M [i + 1][ s], for i = m − 1 . . . 0
s ∈Σ

6.3 Compact approach to automaton construction

In (Pizzi et al., 2011) an algorithm with optimal O(n ) searching time was proposed to solve
the problem of proﬁle matching (i.e. given a string x, a threshold T and a matrix M, ﬁnd all
the hits of M in x).
This algorithm is based on the classic multi-pattern matching algorithm based on the
Aho-Corasick automaton (Aho et al., 1974). In summary, an automaton is built that contains
all the words that are a match for the given threshold and matrix.
The look-ahead technique can be used in this context to generate all and only the words of
length m that are hits. The words are generated directly in a trie, that will later be annotated
with failure links to build the Aho-Corasick automaton. Starting from the empty trie, only
symbols which score is above tla [0] are expanded. Each node will take track of the partial
score of the path from the root to the node itself, and will recursively expand further levels in
a similar way with comparison with the look-ahead partial thresholds.
Depending on the given threshold, and on the distribution of the score within the matrix, the
size of the trie is very variable, but can become prohibitive. In fact by decreasing the threshold
(e.g. increasing the p-value), the number of words that are hits for the matrix increases, and
can possibly reach an exponential number (the worst case given by | Σ| m ).
The minimum gain can then be used to substantially reduce the size of the automaton,
implementing the compact approach philosophy. The idea is to limit the length of the words
that are hits for the matrix whenever a preﬁx of the word is enough to establish that there will
be a hit. While building the trie this means that we do not need to build the subtree of this
preﬁx. The cost of the further comparison with tmg at construction time is irrelevant compared
to the time saved by avoiding to build the subtree. Moreover, there could be considerable
space savings. See, for example what happens when we consider matrix M00003 from the

Jaspar database (Sandelin et al., 2004), and the threshold score , corresponding to MSS=0,85
(see Table 7). The entries of the matrix have been already multiplied by the factors needed to
compute the score relative to MSS (Quandt et al., 1995).
The matrix entries have been sorted in ascending order, so each table entry on the ﬁrst four
columns contains a pair (symbol,score), and the last two columns hold the look-ahead and the
minimum gain score, respectively.

Table 7. Computation of scores for the matrix M00003 of the Jaspar database.
When we build the trie using the look-ahead technique, we have that at the ﬁrst level only
the symbol G has a score that is above the partial threshold tla [0]. Hence we will have only
one child node for the root, with partial score 18500. At the second level we have again that
only the score of one symbol, (C,18500) summed up with the current partial threshold 18500,
will give a score (37000) above the partial threshold 27279. Again we add a single child to the
previous node, and label the edge with C. At the third step only C have a score that summed
up with the path partial score (37000) will give a value (55500) that is above tla [2] = 45779.
The trie is then extended a further level using only symbol C. From now on we can notice that
the partial threshold of this path is already above any following look-ahead partial thresholds.
This means that all symbols will be considered at each level, thus obtaining a full subtree of
high 6. This implicity means that the preﬁx GCC is enough to establish whether there is an hit
or not. If when building the trie we compare the value of the path partial threshold with the
minimum gain partial threshold we can stop early the computation, and set as the ﬁnal state
of the Aho-Corasick automaton the current node.
The minimum gain basically deﬁnes classes of equivalence within the space of hits of the
matrix. Hits that share the same preﬁx do not need to be totally inserted in the trie. It sufﬁces
to insert their common representative preﬁx.
In case of matrix M00003, we will save the construction of ∑6i=1 4i nodes, that is the number
of nodes of the full subtrees rooted at the common preﬁx. This means that instead of having
5464 nodes we just have 4 (including the root).

In terms of a compact approach, the minimum gain partitions the set of words that are a hit
for a given matrix and threshold in classes in which the representative is the shortest preﬁx
with a score that, summed up with the minimum sum of score that can follow, is above the
threshold.

7. Conclusion
In this chapter we discussed the compact approach for the discovery of signiﬁcant signals
(motifs) in biological sequences. Compact approaches are characterized by a signiﬁcant
reduction of the size of the output, without loss of crucial information. Compact approaches
that have been developed in these years for several different motif models have been
illustrated and discussed, also with the help of practical examples.

1. Introduction
-catenin, originally identified in Drosophila as the segment polarity protein armadillo, is a
multifunctional protein that is encoded in humans by the CTNNB1 gene. β-catenin is found
in at least three cellular pools: (i) at the adherens junctions, where β-catenin binds to the
cytoplasmic domain of type I cadherins and modulates cadherin-dependent cell-cell
adhesion by linking the cadherin/catenin complex to the cortical actin cytoskeleton through
the binding of a-catenin; (ii) the cytoplasm, where β-catenin plays a critical role in the
canonical Wnt signaling cascade by interacting with APC and GSK3β linked destruction
complex, leading to its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome; and
(iii) the nucleus, in association with other transcription factors. The crucial event in the
canonical Wnt signalling cascade is the cytoplasmic stabilization of β–catenin, leading to its
subsequent nuclear localization and gene transcription activity (Liu & Millar 2010). To date,
numerous β-catenin target genes have been identified in diverse biological systems
(http://www.stanford.edu/%7ernusse/wntwindow.html), yet little is understood about β–
catenin outside of its roles in Wnt and cadherin signaling.
Biomedical literature is growing at a double-exponential pace, with more than 19,000,000
publications in MEDLINE of which more than three million were published in the last 5
years alone (Abrams et al., 1998). Over the last 10 years, the total size of MEDLINE (the
database searched by PubMed) has grown at a ~4.1% compounded annual growth rate, and
the number of new entries in MEDLINE each year has grown at a compounded annual
growth rate of ~3.1% (Albert, 1999, 2002, 2005). Thus, a massive wealth of information is
embedded in the literature and waiting to be discovered and extracted. Literature mining is
a promising strategy to utilize this untapped information for knowledge discovery. Most
mining is performed on the abstracts of biomedical articles, which represent a readily
available resource of highly concentrated information and result in high quality extracted
relations (Apte & Weiss, 1997; Card et al., 1996; Chien et al., 2007) . Text mining of
biomedical literature has been applied successfully to various biological problems including
the discovery and characterization of molecular interactions (protein-protein , gene-protein,
gene-drug, protein sorting and molecular binding, consolidating information into a more
accessible form (Babu et al., 2004; Balaji et al., 2006; Giot et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2006).

238

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

Recently, considerable interest and effort has been focused on the construction and analysis
of genome-wide gene networks (McCraith et al., 2000). The task is complicated for heavily
investigated transcription factors such as -catenin due to the large volume of manuscripts
published. As no searchable records are available to efficiently retrieve information relevant
to the -catenin gene network, we extracted gene/protein interactions by text mining
Pubmed abstracts and constructed the -catenin biologic association network. Our textmining by natural language processing established an association of the β-catenin network
with survival signaling, clarifying the fragmentary data that was previously available
describing this relationship and confirming the crucial role of β-catenin in growth and
development.

2. Methods
2.1 Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Medline/PubMed was used as the information source for bioinformatics text mining.
Medline abstracts were retrieved using National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) PubMed portal. We queried Pubmed with: (catenin OR CTNNB OR CTNNB1) AND
("1980/01/01"[PDAT]: "2009/05/24"[PDAT]). All abstracts were downloaded as HTML text
without images and converted into XML documents. Sentence tokenization was performed
with Lingpipe tools. Subsequent analysis was based on the sentence as the basic unit. Gene
mentions (including the -catenin gene) were tagged using ABNER (Egghe & Rousseau,
1990). To solve the matter of the plethora of gene aliases, all gene mentions were normalized
to Entrez gene (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez/) official gene symbols. A genetic
interaction of the verb dictionary was established from BioNLP item
(http://bionlp.sourceforge.net/), containing verbs such as repress, regulate, inhibit, interact,
phosphorylate, downregulate, upregulate and all other verbs and their variants. Verbs in
abstracts were tagged using Lingpipe and the interaction verb dictionary (Ghannad-Rezaie
et al., 2006). Only sentences with the -catenin gene, a proper interaction verb and another
gene were selected. In order to test the null hypothesis 'the relationship between -catenin
and another gene is random', the hypergeometric distribution test was employed (Kim et al.,
1997).
N represents the total number of PubMed abstracts and m and n represent the number gene
mentions in PubMed for -catenin and a related gene, respectively.

Where:

The -catenin-gene' relations with p-value<0.05 were then summarized and subjected to a
relational database for further analysis. The flowchart of our NLP pipeline is shown as
Figure 1.
2.2 Gene ontology analysis
Gene ontology analysis was performed using the GSEABase package of BioConductor
(http://www.bioconductor.org/). A gene set enrichment analysis was performed on

Data Mining Pubmed Using Natural Language
Processing to Generate the β-Catenin Biological Association Network

239

the 543 β-catenin-related genes based on the gene ontology (GO) categories (Rual et al.,
2005).
2.3 Pathway and gene network analysis
Expression Analysis Systematic Explorer (EASE) was used to analyze KEGG pathways.
Over representation of genes in a KEGG pathway was present if a larger fraction of genes
within that pathway was differentially expressed compared to all other genes in the
genome. The ‘-catenin-verb-gene’ relationships retrieved by our NLP system were filtered
by pathway enrichment analysis. The links between -catenin and related genes were
visualized using Cytoscape software (Lopez & Blobel, 2008) (http://www.cytoscape.org/).
Genes were grouped according to pathway. Genes that are involved in multiple pathways
were assigned to a single pathway with the smallest enrichment p-value. Integrating
PubMed text mining, homology prediction, gene neighbor, protein-protein interaction, gene
fusion and other data sources through the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting
Genes/Proteins(STRING) , we created the β-catenin related genes knowledge-driven
network (Sousa et al., 2004; Uetz et al., 2000).

3. Experimental results
3.1 Identification of β-catenin interaction genes
Query of β-catenin on Pubmed with: (catenin OR CTNNB OR CTNNB1) AND
("1980/01/01"[PDAT]: "2009/05/24"[PDAT]) led to the identification of 10018 articles
describing putative interactions between β-catenin and other genes. Titles containing the βcatenin gene along with a proper interaction verb and another gene were selected for further
analysis. A total of 543 genes with published interaction with β-catenin were identified
(scheme describing the NLP process, Fig. 1; visualization of the 543 genes Fig. 2).

Fig. 1. Schematic representation of the literature-based gene network analysis. Literature
mining by natural language processing was performed on all Pubmed abstracts available
from 1/1/1980-5/24/2009. Mining identified 10018 articles describing putative interactions
between -catenin and another gene product, revealing 543 distinct -catenin interacting
proteins.
Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A) was the most prevalent gene identified,
commonly referred to as a β-catenin “target” in the literature. Table 1 provides a list of the
10 most frequently published interactions with β-catenin, and their putative relationship.

Among the 543 gene products, 18 distinct putative protein-protein relationships were
identified involving β-catenin, with the distribution of the seven most frequent
relationships
included in Fig. 3. The most common relationship, complexing with β-catenin, was
identified for 213 (39.2%) of the gene products (Fig. 3), including TCF4/TCF7L2 and
LEF/LEF1. 54 (9.5%) gene products were identified as β-catenin targets, including cell cycle
regulating proteins cyclinD1 and CDC42, proteins that influence cellular migratory behavior
including uPA, Timp3, and CD44 and proteins that play a role in differentiation such as
BMP-7, FGF8 and PPAR-d.

Fig. 3. Frequency distribution of protein ‘relationships’ with -catenin. Literature mining
revealed 18 types of relationships exhibited by -catenin with the 543 identified gene
products. Relationship type is expressed as the percent of total proteins analyzed.
Analysis revealed that the most frequent relationship is “associate” (31.31%), while the
least frequent relationship, occurring for only one associated protein, is
“dephosphorylate”.
3.2 β-catenin-related gene function
To better understand the biological role of the 543 β-catenin-related genes identified, and
demonstrate the complexity of the β-catenin-related genes interaction network, we
performed a Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis.
GO provides structured, controlled ontologies for describing gene products in terms of their
associated molecular function, biological process, or cellular compartment. Enrichment for
molecular function revealed that most β-catenin-associated genes, including KIT, HSF1,
XPO1, HSPA5, FGF8 and ALCAM, encode proteins that bind to β-catenin. Genes such as
CAPN3, EPHA7, PTGER4, SRC, BMP4 composed the second largest category, encoding for
proteins that act as signal transducers (Fig. 4, left panel). Enrichment for biological process
revealed that the most common functions of gene products associated with β-catenin
include developmental processes, cell communication and signaling transduction (Fig. 4,
middle panel). Finally, enrichment for the cellular compartments where β-catenin associated
gene products can be found primarily included the cytoplasm, nucleus and plasma
membrane (Fig. 4, right panel).

sorted all data by Molecular Function, Biological Process and Cellular Compartment. GO
analysis revealed that protein binding is the most prevalent molecular function of -catenin
interacting proteins, development, cell communication and signal transduction are the most
common biological processes involved and the gene products are active primarily in
cytoplasm, nucleus and plasma membrane.

whose corrected P-value was less than 0.01 (Table 2), and 321 of the genes belonged to these
14 pathways. Pathway analysis was visualized using the Cytoscape software (Fig. 5). The
Using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING), we created
a β-catenin related genes network (Fig. 6). STRING incorporates known and predicted
protein interaction information from HPRD, BioGrid, MINT, BIND, DIP, and imports
known reactions from Reactome and KEGG pathways to generate a generalized source of
protein interaction information. STRING analysis of β-catenin related genes revealed several
hub genes, or genes in which high connection exists giving these genes an influential role in
network stability. Hub genes identified include AKT1, CCND1, CTNNB1, JUN, TP53 and
VEGFA (Fig. 7).

in the -catenin network, with mean frequency counts >86 (p <0.001).

4. Discussion
Gene/protein interaction networks provide critical information for a thorough
understanding of cellular processes. Thus, detailed characterization of interactions between
individual genes or proteins has become a primary focuses of biological research (Barabasi
& Oltvai, 2004) . The complete biomedical literature database, containing a massive amount
of information attained over a long period of time, is a largely untapped repository of
information for study of gene/protein interaction networks (Chalmers et al., 1998; Gónzalez
& Ochoa ,2008). Here, we generated a molecular network of β-catenin associated proteins.
Analysis revealed that these proteins interacted with β-catenin via 18 different relationships,
perform 13 biologic functions, take part in 15 cellular processes, localize to 12 cellular
compartments, and signal in 14 different pathways. Significantly, this analysis identified a
vast and mostly uncharacterized role for β-catenin in signal transduction pathways distinct
from the Wnt and cadherin pathways. In particular, β-catenin may have a significant role in
cell survival signaling.
Our analysis was performed using only abstracts instead of full text manuscripts. Our
studies suggest that full-text articles contain too much detail for high-throughput analysis of
biomedical research and development, while abstracts usually have higher information
density and result in better quality relations extracted by text mining techniques. Further,
abstracts are freely available through most public databases. Due to the large number of
abstracts (10018) analyzed, we believe that the network data generated is both
comprehensive and significant (Mackinnon et al., 2008; Ouzounis & Karp, 2000; Ptacek et al.,
2005; Thieffry et al., 1998) .

246

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

Wnt/β-catenin signaling is involved in almost every aspect of embryonic development and
controls homeostatic self-renewal in lots of adult tissues. Gene Otology identified three
biological process (developmental process, cell communication and signaling transduction)
that are significantly overrepresented within the β-catenin associated network. Validating
these observations, several severe phenotypes in multiple tissues and organs can be
observed in flies, frogs, fish, and mice following loss of Wnt/β-catenin signaling
components. In adults, Wnt/β-catenin signaling remains essential throughout life for
driving tissue renewal in rapidly self-renewing organs, including the intestine and skin. In
addition, deregulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling upsets the homeostatic balance in selfrenewing tissues and leads to a variety of abnormalities and disease including bone defects
and cancer. Pathway analysis of the β-catenin associated network revealed a close
relationship between β-catenin and survival signaling (i.e. the Wnt, MAPK, insulin, and
adhesion junction pathways), supporting an important role for β-catenin pathway in growth
and development. Integration of PubMed text mining, homology prediction, gene neighbor,
protein-protein interaction, gene fusion and other data sources identified AKT1, CCND1,
CTNNB1, JUN, TP53 and VEGFA as hub genes in the β-catenin signaling network. Network
analysis reveals an extremely high connectivity of these genes with other β-catenin
associated genes. The involvement of these six genes in survival signaling, including antiapoptosis, cell cycle and cell migration, provides further surport for a vital role for β-catenin
in growth and development.

5. Conclusion
We performed natural language processing, a literature mining tool that can cluster a list of
genes with keywords that are auto-extracted from their up-to-date related literature and
then manually curated by the user, to establish the β-catenin biologic association network.
Our results establish a significant association of this network with survival signaling. These
data demonstrate the power of data-mining strategies as tools for biological discovery,
suggesting that the use of similar strategies to consolidate all existing data for specific
disease states, specifically cancer, may yield yield important discoveries in disease
pathogenesis and identification of novel therapeutic targets. Further analysis of the βcatenin biologic association network may provide a deeper understanding of β-catenin
signaling, particularly in relation to cell survival signaling.

In Silico Identification of
Plant-Derived Antimicrobial Peptides

1. Introduction

The widely available digital information about plant genomes and its products has triggered
the use of bioinformatics and other in silico approaches over gene expression data, from
genome to phenotype-based analysis methods. In such data universe, special attention has
been given to a peptidic group of plant bioactive molecules, the antimicrobial peptides
(AMP), usually small cysteine or glycine-rich peptides antagonistic to several pathogens and
component of plant innate defense. Main classes of AMPs comprise defensins, thionins,
lipid-transfer proteins, cyclotides, snakins and hevein-like, according to amino acid
sequence homology.
Plant biodiversity for antimicrobial peptides search has led to increasing efforts on their
identification and characterization, although such biodiversity still remains largely unexplored
for drug development and other potential applications. As expected, crop species have been
more frequently targeted for AMP research and application, mainly due to higher availability
of molecular data (Pestana-Calsa et al., 2010). AMPs provide novel strategies not only in
medicine but can potentially increase agricultural yields by phytopathogen or pest control.
Those small peptides have wide-range inhibitory activity over phytopathogenic
microorganisms (mostly fungi), as already comproved in enhanced crop resistance to
pathogen attack through genetic breeding and transgenic manipulation (Terras et al., 1995).
Last decade advances in gene expression studies technology brought huge amounts of
genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic datasets, a fruitful field for AMP prospection. Based
on ethnobotanical or even laboratory information, literature concerning in silico analyses of
plant antimicrobial peptides is much smaller than that focusing plant secondary metabolites.
Additionally, bioinformatics tools are usually constrained to model species, whose “-omics”
datasets are available, justifying many heterology-based studies for non-model species.
Thus, data integration is highly desired and helpful to apply bioinformatics approaches
aiming the in silico screening of genomic, transcriptional, proteomic and metabolomic
datasets from cultivated or wild plant species. Preliminary analyses have been commonly
linked to subsequent molecular techniques to identify and characterize AMP-coding genes,
their products and their regulation, besides to validate putative functional aspects in a
systems biology approach. For instance, in silico analyses of AMPs and respective coding
genes determine the way by which different sequences can affect specific pathogens
(Pestana-Calsa etal., 2010).
This chapter focuses on bioinformatics methods, usually associated to molecular biology
tools, to prospect databases, identify and characterize putative or known AMPs, and

250

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

discusses procedures for testing them in vitro and in vivo. Regarding applications, molecular
data must be generated in large scale for a comprehensive set of plant species which have
not been addressed up to date in AMP research field. “-Omics” based experimental
procedures will then be more efficient and reliable, making easier the application of
scientific knowledge from molecular biology and bioinformatics on medicine, agriculture
and industry needs.

2. Bioinformatics on AMP identification
The huge amount of available information over plant secondary metabolites effects on
human health has demanded the usage of bioinformatics tools on transcriptomic,
proteomic and metabolomic profiles from different plant species, concerning single as
well as mixtures of phytochemicals (Ulrich-Merzenich et al., 2007). Indeed, most results
experimentally obtained for bioactive antimicrobial secondary metabolites might be also
derived from correlated AMPs sinergy (Verpoorte at al., 2005). Nowadays increasing
number of described plant antimicrobial peptides, in parallel to exponential growth in
nucleotide and protein data for public access, allows several possibilities of potential
identification of novel AMP. Preliminary analyses have been commonly followed by
molecular methods to characterize AMP-coding genes and its regulation. Here, in silico
studies of AMP and respective coding genes contributed to unravel their functional
aspects (Hammami et al., 2009).
2.1 Search by genomics and transcriptomics
Searches in genome and transcript sequences datasets have shown to be a comprehensive
and higher yield initial step for seeking candidate AMP-coding genes, mostly due to the
typical large-scale coverage of the organism genetic potential in such analyses. In silico
starting approaches constitute a way to quickly achieve reliable AMP-coding potential of the
studied plant species, even if it requires further biological validation.
Genomic analyses through DNA sequencing and mapping have been useful to AMP
prospection. Considering model organisms, most green plant species genomes harbor 15-50
defensin-coding genes, even if this number is an under-estimation according to some
authors and may grow by further studies on several other plant species genome-wide
expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries (Silverstein et al., 2005; 2007; Manners, 2007). In
Arabidopsis, 317 defensin-like sequences could be assigned in the genome by hidden
Markov models of in silico search (Silverstein et al., 2005).
Actually, a comprehensive search on standard publicly available gene expression databases
for plant transcript sequences provides a relatively trustable picture of annotated and
putative AMP- related sequences from plants (Table 1). Plant AMPs represent almost 16% of
deposited AMP sequences and, considering all the organisms as well as just plants, lipid
transfer proteins constitute the most abundant group, what may be an over-estimation
(Pestana-Calsa et al., 2010) since they are not only involved in direct plant defense (Chen et
al., 2008; Boutrot et al., 2008). Noteworthy, snakins and heveins appear as plantrepresentative peptides, while defensins and lipid transfer proteins have relatively similar
distribution that when considering all organisms. In opposite, thionins accesses are about 4
times more abundant in plants than in all organisms dataset, and plant cycletides occur in
about 3 times smaller frequency than for all organisms in GenBank, what may represent
under-estimation.

Concerning reference available plant EST collection, the TIGR Plants Gene Indices
(http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/plant.html) is useful to achieve distribution of AMPrelated transcript sequences from crop and weed/pasture species (Figure 1). From the 14
botanical families represented by 34 species, ten are important commodities as soybean,
maize, sugarcane, orange and coffee. It suggests grasses and solanaceous are snakins richer,
while legumes (Graham et al., 2004) have less thionin coding genes.

Fig. 1. Distribution of plant EST unigenes (clusters + singletons) from TIGR Gene Indices
putatively annotated as AMPs. Frequencies were considered including (A) or not including
(B) the putative lipid-transfer proteins (LTP) coding transcripts. Data in each botanical
family derive from: Poaceae (Hordeum vulgare, Zea mays, Oryza sativa, Secale cereale, Sorghum
bicolor, Saccharum spp., Panicum virgatum, Festuca arundinacea, Triticum aestivum); Solanaceae
(Capsicum annuum, Petunia hybrida, Solanum tuberosum, Nicotiana tabacum, Solanum
lycopersicum); Fabaceae (Phaseolus vulgaris, Medicago truncatula, Phaseolus coccineus, Glycine
max); Asteraceae (Lactuca sativa, Lactuca serriola, Helianthus annuus); Rosaceae
(Malus_x_domestica, Prunus persica); Malvaceae (Theobroma cacao, Gossypium); Brassicaceae
(Brassica napus); Alliaceae (Allium cepa); Amaranthaceae (Beta vulgaris); Convolvulaceae
(Ipomoea nil); Pinaceae (Pinus); Rubiaceae (Coffea canephora); Rutaceae (Citrus sinensis); and
Vitaceae (Vitis vinifera). Original data from Pestana et al. (2010).
Such type of analysis usually constitutes an initial step in antimicrobial peptide research in
plants. By allying in silico tools to predict potential AMP-coding genes with “wet”-bench
procedures like PCR-based methods using specific designed oligonucleotides to amplify
AMP-related regions from genomic DNA, novel grass and legume β-defensins have been

252

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

recently identified from sugarcane (Saccharum spp.; Padovan et al., 2009) and cowpea (Vigna
unguiculata; Padovan et al., 2010a). These novel peptides expression was co-related to fungal
infection and drought responses, suggesting biotic and abiotic responsiveness for defensin
activation.
Computational search matches have provided growing helpfulness for AMP genes
identification in concluded and current DNA sequencing projects, as in large transcript
profiling datasets, however the predicted defense-related genes must be functionally tested
(Pestana-Calsa et a., 2010; Belarmino et al., 2010). In spite of rare use, in situ hybridization
methods for AMP studies in plants keep very promising to analyze the spatial and temporal
expression of such peptides in several organs and tissues, under a wide range of treatments
(Tavares et al., 2008).
Genomics and transcriptomics platforms allow the development of strategies to identify
distinct classes of antimicrobial peptides. In pepper (Capsicum annuum), an AMP was
identified and named CaAMP1, which was isolated in a cDNA library from leaves
inoculated by Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria. CaAMP1 expression was induced in
leaves during pathogen infection and after abiotic stressing (Lee & Hwang, 2009). A cDNA
sequence, named VvAMP1, was isolated from grape (Vitis vinifera) berries and coded for a
77 amino acid peptide homologous to defensins (de Beer & Vivier, 2008); also in grape,
comprehensive in silico searches have successfully resulted in AMP candidates (Zamyatnin
& Voronina, 2010).
Transcripts tag sequences from different large-scale gene expression analyses, like cDNA
microarray and SAGE, have been assigned to plant AMP. For instance, cDNA microarray
was used to validate regulation of known AMP genes after hormone signalling in defense
responses (Wan et al., 2002). On the other hand, SAGE-derived approaches have resulted in
suitable databases for AMP detection, as like in sugarcane (Calsa Jr. & Figueira, 2007) and
soybean; in both, tens of transcripts have been putatively annotated as AMP-like and are
under experimental validation (data not shown).
2.2 Search by proteomics
Plant genomic and post-genomic researches have generated large amounts of information
that contributes to understand gene and protein expression profiles, besides their
connection to biological processes. Proteomics results in important data over biological
systems, because it produces information about proteins and peptides, the major functional
and structural determinants of cells (Baginsky, 2009). Conventional two-dimensional gel
electrophoresis (2-DE) to separate and visualize proteins, and mass spectrometry (MS) to
identify proteins and peptides of interest, have been applied. Some 2-DE limitations
concerning AMP analysis refer to retention and visualization on gel of target proteins with
molecular weight lower than 10 KDa (Baggerman et al., 2004) and frequent production in
small quantities by plant cells (Antunes, 2008).
Small protein and native peptide component of plant tissues is a still neglected proteomic
area, and relatively few studies are available (Zhang et al., 2006). Peptidomics have
improved the study of such small polypeptides, by coupling bi or multidimensional liquid
chromatography to mass spectrometry, where high complexity or low concentrated samples
can be efficiently separated via multidimensional liquid chromatography (MDLC), whose
advantage over 2-DE is separation of complex mixtures by using multiple columns
(Barbosa, 2008). Even so, conventional 2-DE followed by MS has also provided important
antimicrobial subproteome/subpeptidome information associated to specific plant samples,

253

In Silico Identification of Plant-Derived Antimicrobial Peptides

as soybean xylem sap (Djordjevic et al., 2007), and to plant-virus interaction, as from
Capsicum annuum cv. Bungang (hot-pepper) infected by tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) (Lee e
al., 2006). Differentially expressed pathogenesis-related proteins and peptides, as defensin,
from sugar beet infected by beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV) were separated by
MDLC, identified by MALDI-TOF/MS and annotated through homology-based search
using amino acid sequence deduced from the MS/MS spectra (Larson et al., 2008).
An interesting perspective on antimicrobial peptides was developed to study the
conservation of structural motifs in AMPs from phylogenetically distant organisms using
proteomic bioinformatics datasets and tools, like PROSITE (ExPASy Proteomics Server,
2011), for multidimensional signature model for AMPs (Yount & Yeaman, 2004). Modeling
is an attempt to unify structural domains in distinct classes of AMP.
Additionally, proteomics approaches have been successful in the identification of signalling
elements that regulates defensins in plants (Widjaja et al., 2010).
2.3 AMP databases
Hundreds of known AMP sequences are available at UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, while other
repository collections are in other accessible links (Table 2). The major ones are ANTIMIC
(Brahmachary et al., 2004), Antimicrobial Sequence database AMSDb (eukaryotic), Peptaibol
(fungal, Whitmore & Wallace, 2004), APD (Wang & Wang, 2004) and APD2 (Wang et al.,
2009). Among them, the PhytAMP (http://phytamp.pfba-lab.org), a database specific for
plant AMPs, was developed providing access to informations regarding studies and
applications for these peptides (Hammami et al., 2009), and organizing sequences and
corresponding taxonomic, physicochemical, structural, taxonomical and publications over
each deposited AMP.
Bioinformatics tools have been developed in agreement to “–omics” databases
requirements. An example was the alignment of known antibacterial peptides aiming to
detect preferential residues by artificial neural network, since certain amino acids are more
frequent in some positions, particularly at the N or C terminus (Lata et al., 2007). Other
successful advances resulted from enlargement of AMP catalogs, basically through
clustering and alignment to previously annotated sequences; this approach has been quite
useful on putative AMPs identification in comprehensive datasets (Fjell et al., 2207).
Statistical modeling is applied over genomic, transcriptional and proteomic data in the aim
to identify peptides, also domains from already functionally annotated proteins, which
present significant motifs and/or structure match to AMP (Nagarajan et al., 2006).

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

As expected, economically relevant crop plant species have commonly been the main target
for antimicrobial peptides research and biotechnological application, due to associated
agricultural and social demand and impact, but also because the higher availability of
molecular data. In spite of such trend, several research efforts have pointed a huge potential
for wild plant species prospection to achieve discovery of novel AMPs, as well as the
identification of novel biological functions to known AMPs. Hence, plant biodiversity in
different biomes and ecosystems is an outstanding promising focus on antimicrobial
peptides investigation (Pieters & Vlietinck, 2005).
A very recent revised list of experimentally confirmed plant AMP, with physicochemical
and antibacterial specificity is also available, comprising members of the main families: 23
defensins, eight hevein-like, six vicilin-like, five knottins, four cyclotides, two Impatienslike, two sepherins, two snakins, one MBP-1 (from maize), one glutamate-rich, one glycinerich, and other eight peptides not classified in these structural families (Pelegrini et al.,
2011).

3. Structural analyses and function
An example of the lack in plant AMP cataloguing is the organized database for antibacterial
phytochemical compounds hosted and managed by Kioto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes (KEGG Compound, Plant Secondary Metabolites), where the related biosynthetic
enzymes and molecular targets in human organism are fully described. However, no plantderived AMP or coding gene sequence is set, since the database allows the access only to
human microbicidal and cytotoxic peptides.
Bioinformatics have been essential on plant AMP prospection and establishment of
catalogues, which have increased in last decade (Hammami et al., 2009). Several sequence
aligment tools, usually BLAST-based (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast) are available, but other
main technical approaches have included in silico structural peptide prediction and putative
analyses of AMP-target molecule interactions. Last but not least, direct chemical isolation
have also depended of in silico tools to achive more complete structural and functional
characterization of isolated AMP.
3.1 Isolation
Complementarily to the several classes of chemical compounds synthesized by plants
secondary metabolism, with proved antimicrobial effects, the characterization of plant
AMPs function correlated to such effects is extremely useful to improve research in this
area. Although very likely, supposing that AMPs are co-responsible or even responsible
for antimicrobial activity of complex plant extracts relies on sub-fractioning and
experimental evidence (Moreira et al., 2011). Direct isolation of plant AMPs has succeeded
in several species (Kovaleva et al., 2009; Rogozhin et al., 2011), associated to further cDNA
cloning and characterization as defensin and lipid transfer protein. Also, extraction and
purification of candidate peptides, followed by sequencing and match to AMP databases,
allowed the identification of novel promising antimicrobial molecules in wheat
(Odintsova et al., 2009).
Efforts to prospect AMPs in plant crop species and many examples of direct isolation
followed by functional assays and characterization are available. As alternative to fungicide
usage to pathogen control in agriculture, several studies have focused on searching for plant
proteins and peptides with antifungal activities (AFPs). Recently, two novel 10 and 15 kDa

AFPs were isolated from rosemary pepper (Lippia sidoides Cham.) flowers through OctylSepharose hydrophobic column separation, and were able to inhibit the development of
Botrytis cinerea, an economically harmful phytopathogen for many crops (Moreira et al.,
2011). The N-termini sequences of these AFPs have homology with NBS-LRR R proteins,
well known plant defense elements.
A 11,500 heterodimeric antifungal protein, named Pa-AFP1, highly similar to 2S albumin
family, was purified by anionic exchange Q-Sepharose chromatography associated with
HPLC reversed-phase C4 chromatography and structurally confirmed as dimer by
MALDI-TOF spectra analyses (Ribeiro et al., 2011). It inhibits the growth of fungus
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, but no antibacterial nor anti-yeast activity was observed. an
antiviral 2 KDa peptide was purified from sorghum seeds by gel filtration, ion exchange
and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and showed strong inhibition of
herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and bovine herpes virus (BHV) replication
(Camargo-Filho et al., 2007). On the other hand, two anti-yeast peptides were isolated
from seeds of a phytobacterial-resistance pepper (Capsicum annuum) genotype and
identified by amino acid sequencing (Ribeiro et al., 2007). Another research identified
peptides with bactericidal activity from sesame (Sesamum indicum) kernel flour; one of
them, with 5.8 KDa, showed activity only against Klebsiella sp., a Gram-negative
bacterium causal of human urinary infection (Costa et al., 2007). More detailed structural
and functional results were achieved for a cowpea seed γ-thionin/defensin, a widespectrum bactericide whose primary structure, mechanism of action and tissue
localization during germination provided the understanding of these bioactive peptides in
plant defense responses (Franco et al., 2006).
An example of how native or introduced plant biodiversity may be a fruitful option on AMP
research is the recent growing number of such peptides identified in Brazilian species.
Direct purification was achieved in originally African legume Crotalaria pallida, a widely
dispersed weed in South America and abundant in drought and warm “caatinga” biome. A
novel peptide structurally similar to defensin/2S-albumin was isolated from seeds and
presented inhibitory effects over bacteria (Pelegrini et al., 2008). From seeds of guava
(Psidium guajava) and passion fruit (Passiflora edulis), the antifungal and antibacterial
peptides Pg-AMP1, passiflin and a 2S albumin-like were isolated. PgAMP1 comprises
approximately 6 KDa of molecular mass and small amounts of a homodimer; amino acid
sequencing indicated it belongs to glycine-rich plant protein family, being the first one
having activity towards Gram-negative bacteria; instead passiflin and the 2S albumin-like
peptide show high antifungal properties (Pelegrini et al., 2006; Lam & Ng, 2009).
Several plant species from Atlantic rainforest and “cerrado” biomes have been studied to
confirm and explain their antimicrobial activity as transmitted popular medicine (reviewed
in Pestana-Calsa et al., 2010). For instance, out from 32 plant species selected after field
survey, extracts from 13 species presented antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus
aureus, but further analyses to identify potential peptides involved in such activity keep
lacking (Brasileiro et al., 2006; Silva Jr. et al., 2009). Molecular and bioinformatics approaches
could start from applied phytochemical researches similar to these and is very likely that
known and novel AMPs could be found.
3.2 Structural and functional analysis
As any peptide, AMP function is strictly dependent of strucuture. Specifically for relatively
abundant α-helical AMPs, structural features and physicochemical properties have been

256

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

targeted to increase antimicrobial activity, usually by changing molecular size and charge,
residues arrangement, hydrophobicity, amphipathicity and helix folding probability (Tossi
et al., 2000; Tian et al., 2009). Antimicrobial peptides structure/activity ratio results in their
molecular diversity, but they do share some common features, as the low molecular weight
and the variable number of disulphide bond-cysteines residues stabilizing conserved
scaffolds (Padovan et al., 2010c), which is used to group them into different structural
classes, as depicted in Figure 2.

Fig. 2. Structural and phylogenetic representation of plant AMPs compiled in PhytAMP
database. α-helices and β-sheets are respectively shown in red and purple (from original by
Hammami et al., 2009)
Aiming to achieve more effective peptides, natural/original sequences may be re-arranged
(Boman et al., 1989). Several protein databases and analyses tools (e.g. Swiss-Prot and links)
are available, as softwares designed specifically to deal with predicting and modifying
peptide structure and physicochemical improvement as ArgusLab, Anthewin and Peptool
(detailed usage described by Wang, 2007; Hao et al., 2008). Simulations within in silico
environments have been applied to test AMPs topology concerning biological effects and to
unravel their probable mode of action, usually by interactions that destabilize lipid bilayers

In Silico Identification of Plant-Derived Antimicrobial Peptides

257

(e.g. maculatin, that changes the lysis mechanism depending on lipid structure of target
membrane; Bond et al., 2008).
Sometimes, naturally occurring AMP structure is not the most effective. The influence of 2
disulfide bonds in a small β-sheet AMP (Ib-AMP1) from Impatiens balsamina seeds was
verified as not essential for antimicrobial activity, because the synthetic linear analogs
displayed by 4.8-fold higher inhibitory specificity than the wild-type peptide (Wang et al.,
2009). Also the seed antimicrobial peptide Cy-AMP1 from Cycas revoluta was analyzed on its
chitin-binding ability, a well-conserved feature in other AFP as knottin and hevein
(Yokoyama et al., 2009): antifungal activity of the peptide was strongly reduced after
variations in chitin-binding motifs.
Both MsDef1 and MtDef4 defensins, potent growth inhibitors of several filamentous fungi
including Fusarium graminearum, induced plasma membrane permeabilization; however,
MtDef4 is more efficient based on its unique γ-core motif, indicating that it defines specific
antifungal properties of each defensin, and so may help de novo design of more effective
AMP (Sagaram et al., 2011). The barley derived α-Hordothionin (αHTH), another
membrane-permeabilizing peptide with broad-range antimicrobial activity, is supposed to
act as small water-selective channel, through the αHTH double α-helix core when the
peptide interacts with anions (Oard, 2011); conserved cysteine and tyrosine residues lined
pore walls, resembling aquaporins that delivers water molecules to the lipid bilayer center,
what may lead to localized membrane disruption.
The well known chitin-binding lectin hevein has served as template to synthetic mutant
peptides that interact with chitin oligosaccharides (main components of fungi cell walls), but
mutant AMP versions may present decrease in the association kinetics to target chitooligosaccharides (Chávez et al., 2010). Such results, provided by nuclear magnetic resonance
followed by image modelling analysis tools, pointed that mutant and parent Hev32 peptides
three-dimensional structures were quite similar, including orientations of the three key Trp
aromatic residues; hence, it was supposed that the mutant lower affinity relied on distinct
topology orientation of key side chains and protein-sugar intermolecular essential hydrogen
bonds.
Structural and functional design of AMPs from plants manipulated to be active in plants
must attend to the agricultural demand for novel antimicrobial compounds, more
specifically in plant disease control, with lower toxicity to consumers and environment
(reviewed by Montesinos & Bardaji, 2008). In medicine and therapeutics for infectious
diseases, AMPs effects on human cells can be widely verified in different gene expression
levels, allowing to accurately confirming expected antimicrobial action without undesirable
side effects (Ulrich-Merzenich et al., 2007). Also, synthetic peptides engineering have
contributed with novel insights for antimicrobial drugs and treatments, by testing in vitro
and in vivo several amino acid sequences putatively harbouring antagonistic effects to
microorganisms (Choi & Moon, 2009).
Although every class or family of AMP has specific features in structure, activity and
potential technological applications, few are so remarkably intriguing as the generally
named cyclotides, very stable plant cyclic peptides which harbour many potential
technological usages in pharmaceutical and agricultural strategies, according to their
various bioactivities and fitness as protein-engineering templates (Henriques & Craik, 2010).
Cyclotides compise the largest known family of head-to-tail cyclic peptides, have
approximately 30 amino acid residues with a complex structure containing a circular
peptide backbone and a cystine knot. They are mainly found in plants of Violaceae and

258

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

Rubiaceae families, and supposed to act mostly in plant protection. In addition to
insecticidal properties, cyclotides may have cytotoxic, anti-HIV and antimicrobial effects,
among other activities as to inhibit neurotensin binding ability (Gerlach et al., 2010). A
cyclotide in alkaloid fraction from root bark of Discaria americana (Rhamnaceae) was isolated
and structurally determined, but did not inhibit the growth of challenged bacteria
significantly (Giacomelli et al., 2004). However, other cycletides extracted from Scutia
buxifolia, also a Rhamnaceae family member, were much more efficient to inhibit bacterial
cells than Discaria-derived cycletides, although no antifungal effect was observed (Morel et
al., 2005).
Regarding prospection of structure-function clues, cyclic peptides isolated from
Euphorbiaceae species have been intensively studied due to their rigid three-dimensional
conformation, considered to be essential for bioactivity over lipid membranes (Barbosa et
al., 2011). As example, cyclotide labaditin and derived synthetic open chain analogs were
chemically and virtually analysed in comparison over their interaction with lipid bilayers,
and results suggested the native labaditin had greater membrane insertion. A possible
mechanism for this is based on initial hydrophobic interaction with the lipid membrane
followed by conformational change, peptide adsorption and internalization; indeed, native
labaditin reduced viability in Gram-positive bacteria (Barbosa et al., 2011).
Some plant AMPs have so many unique structural features which impair its insertion into
any previous, well-characterized AMP family. This is the case of antimicrobial peptide IbAMP1, formed by a 20-residue disulfide-linked beta-sheet and usually found in the seeds of
Impatiens balsamina. Using it as template molecule, synthetic analogs were obtained in order
to check the relevance of 2 disulfide bonds on the antimicrobial activity and specificity
(Wang et al., 2009).
Beyond conventionally detected cationic antimicrobial peptides, there are also anionic
antimicrobial peptides/proteins (AAMPs), reported since 1980s and accepted as important
components of innate immune systems of plants and animals (Harris et al., 2009). AAMPs
present activity against bacteria, fungi, viruses and insects, but noteworthy their
antimicrobial activity is believed to be secondary. Structures vary from alpha-helical
peptides in amphibians to cyclic cystine knots in some plant peptides, and certain AAMPs
are suggested to link metal ions forming cationic salt bridges with negatively charged lipids
of microbial membranes. In bioinformatics context, softwares and analysis parameters must
be adjusted and present enough flexibility to cope in a suitable manner with such huge
structural and charge inversion, if compared to data obtained from “conventional”
antimicrobial peptides dynamics and biological function.
3.3 Heterologous expression
Several AMPs, mostly defensins, have been studied through gene cloning and expression in
heterologous systems (Kovaleva et al., 2011). In this context, perhaps one of the main
contributions of bioinformatics is the codon-usage optimization for heterologous expression
of AMPs, depending on host organism.
Heterologous expression of AMPs also refers to increasing interest for production of
antimicrobial compounds such as the defensins, whose applications include health,
agriculture and industry as targets. Specifically to protect food or bio-fuel crops, several
strategies have been proposed and tested in order to isolate and produce defensins.
Experimental viability is still mostly constrained in academic research, where defensins
have been heterogously expressed in bacteria, yeasts, fungi and plants (Padovan et al.,

In Silico Identification of Plant-Derived Antimicrobial Peptides

259

2010b); on the other hand, (bio)-chemical synthesis is not usual yet for commercial
production purposes, and here the most striking challenge is to keep correct
protein/peptide folding in vitro.
A novel defensin-like peptide, isolated from Nicotiana megalosiphon, NmDef02 was
heterologously expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris, and the purified recombinant protein
was found to display antimicrobial activity in vitro against important plant pathogens.
Constitutive expression of NmDef02 gene in transgenic tobacco and potato plants enhanced
resistance against various plant microbial pathogens, including the oomycete Phytophthora
infestans, causal agent of the economically important potato late blight disease, under
greenhouse and field conditions (Portieles et al., 2010).
Other type of AMP, a defensin from cowpea seeds was heterologously assessed on its
putative alpha-amylase inhibitory action probably involved in protection against pests (Dos
Santos et al., 2010). Its cDNA was cloned into plasmidial expression vector and transformed
into Escherichia coli cells; the recombinant peptide was then purified via affinity
chromatography, identified by sequencing and submitted to alpha-amylase inhibition assay
together with seeds-isolated defensin. Both peptides inhibited alpha-amylases from weevil
(Callosobruchus maculatus) but were not able to inhibit mammalian alpha-amylases.
Heterologous expression, supported by comprehensive in silico prediction and peptide
design tools, will probably keep being one of the most helpful tools for biological research
over plant AMP, based on success in literature. However, large scale production of AMP
establishment will depend on results of future studies where the main tasks shall be the
engineering/re-design of more stable and self-folding peptides, and definition of optimized
biotechnological procedure to cost-effectively produce the peptide, as molecular farming
transgenic plants.

4. AMP-coding genes promoter analysis
The search on regulatory genomic regions, mainly promoter elements, has presented
increasing usefulness to start unravelling the control mechanisms of activation of AMP-coding
genes. These are known to be expressed in defense signalling against microbial pathogens,
involving several transduction components that depend on the action of hormones as jasmonic
acid (JA), ethylene (ET) and abscisic acid (ABA). An in silico approach with potential
applicability on tracking regulatory pathways of AMP coding genes is their promoter
sequence analysis.
It is known that JA and ET signaling pathways are synergistic for activation of AMPs,
especially the defensin PDF1.2. The coding pdf1.2 is targeted and expressed after activation
by ORA59 transcription factor, a APETALA2/Ethylene response Factor (AP2/ERF)-domain
protein, which is dependent of JA and ET signaling pathways. The pdf1.2 promoter contains
two GCC boxes that were confirmed to be the ligation site for ORA59 transcription factor,
enabling PDF1.2 coding gene to respond simultaneously to both hormones (Zarei et al.,
2011).
The characterization of tissue-specific and pathogen-inducible promoters is essential for
localized expression of defense-related genes as AMP. Wheat and rice defensin genes
expressed in early developing grain and during grain germination were compared regarding
their promoters activity, through stable transformation with promoter-GUS reporter fusion
constructs (Kovalchuk et al., 2010). Activity was detected mainly in ovary before and at
anthesis in both transgenic cereal species, but differences concerning one or other species were

260

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

observed in the expression of transgenic constructs in reproductive tissues. Even so, wheat and
rice promoters were strongly induced by wounding in leaf, stem and grain.
Specifically for plant lipid transfer proteins (LTPs), which are very unkown on antimicrobial
function although being well-known in other cellular activities, the study of gene promoter
sequence may reveal defense-related aspects. From a Vitis vinifera genomic library 2,100-bp
fragment, the coding region and the promoter of a lipid transfer protein 1 (VvLTP1) was
screened, revealing several defense-related cis-regulatory elements, like MYB-boxes
(Laquitaine et al., 2006). The expression of VvLTP1 promoter-GUS fusion construct in
Arabidopsis thaliana indicated the antifungal response of VvLTP1 from grape.

5. AMP from plant-related microorganisms
The growing number of distinct species whose genomes, transcripts, proteins and other
molecular data are being deposited in public databases makes more reasonable to consider
antimicrobial peptides produced by other organisms, specially in the cases where these
species, although not plants, have strict ecological relationship with host or neighboring
plants. Several examples have been described in literature normally including well-known
or potential endophytes, which produce AMPs in a predictable symbiotic context.
Obviously, the applications derived from this type of research are supposed to be useful
within sustainable biological control of pathogens and pests.
The mycelium-forming actinomycetes of the genus Frankia (well known producers of
bioactive compounds) are commonly found as symbionts in actinorhizal plants,
performing facultative nitrogen-fixing. Bioinformatic analysis of the strains ACN14a,
CcI3, and EAN1pec by genomes prediction and by intact cells MALDI-TOF allowed the
identification of putative coding regions and molecules associated to cyclic peptides,
siderophores, pigments, signaling molecules and specialized lipids, from which some
cyclotides and lipid-transfer proteins are considered to be essential for host-endophyte
recognizing and to inhibit other competitor microorganisms, as pathogens (Udwary et al.,
2011).
Pyoverdines (PVDs), high affinity siderophores well studied in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were
searched in silico in P. fluorescens SBW25 (a plant growth-promoter endophyte) complete but
not annotated genome, where 31 genes putatively involved in PVD biosynthesis, transport
or regulation, could be identified (Moon et al., 2008). Since pyoverdine-mediated iron
uptake is essential for this endophyte, structural analysis of its PVDs was achieved and
defined it as a partly cyclic seven residue peptide backbone, which makes the bacteria able
to utilize a wide variety of exogenous PVDs.
Another interesting example can be traced for alamethicin, a membrane-active AMP
produced by root symbiont fungus Trichoderma viride that permeabilises plasma membrane,
mitochondria and plastids of in vitro cultured plant cells by creating voltage-dependent
pores (Aidemark et al., 2010). Cultured plant cells pre-treated with pathogen elicitors did
not get resistant to alamethicin, while those treated with cellulase did; this suggested that
different membrane lipid composition induced by cellulase may render the cells resistant to
alamethicin, in a mechanism where possible cellulase-secreting pathogens (as several
phytopathogenic fungi) would suffer alamethicin action in their membranes. Other fungusderived AMPs have been described as candidates for production and biotechnological uses
in plant protection, as the cystein-rich antifungal peptide AcAFP, secreted by Aspergillus
clavatus (Skouri-Gargouri et al., 2010).

In Silico Identification of Plant-Derived Antimicrobial Peptides

261

Development of applications derived from plant-related microorganisms AMP in biological
control of pathogens and pests will depend on ecological modeling studies, even if it starts
from a single AMP being produced by an endophyte but biologically active in the host plant.

6. Novel AMP functions in plants
Relatively recent studies have added new insights in plant-derived AMP functions, other
than classical antimicrobial activity. In fact, the ubiquitous presence of AMPs in distantly
related taxa allows the concept that novel functions for derived AMP genes and products
may have arisen during each species evolutionary history. Literature is rich in wellestablished as well as still unkown biological functions for AMP in plants. In this context,
even no-peptidic biomolecules could be considered in a wider view.
Perillic acid is a terpenoid plant extract with antiinfective and anticancer properties, and is a
small cyclic molecule structurally similar to salicylic acid. It is known to cause large-scale
membrane thinning, a clearly possible antimicrobial activity through a membrane-lytic
mechanism very close to that of AMPs (Khandelia et al., 2010). Indeed, also subproteins or
subpeptides may be relevant to antimicrobial activity in silico prospection. Plant-specific
insert domain (PSI) is a region of about 100 amino acid residues, contained in several plant
aspartic protease (AP) precursors. The PSI from potato aspartic protease 1 was purified after
heterologous expression, and was able to kill pathogenic spores in a dose-dependent
manner, without deleterious effect on host plant, and through lytic interaction with
microbial cell wall/or membrane (Muñoz et al., 2010).
In roots of host legume plants, a complex and evolutionary successful symbiosis takes place
with nitrogen-fixing Rhizobium bacteria. Surprisingly, the bacteria irreversible differentiation
to bacterioid form is also dependent of plant factors, nodule-specific cysteine-rich (NCR)
peptides, that are driven to bacterial membrane and cytosol (van de Velde et al., 2010). Since
NCRs are similar to AMPs, it is very likely that the host plant adopted effectors from innate
immune system for symbiosis, resulting in a control mechanism to the endosymbiotic
bacteria cell fate.
Other proteins initially thought to be not related to AMPs have been well linked to
regulation of defense mechanisms that include such peptides. Examples have been
described where specific phosphatases are key responsive proteins to pathogen infection
and induce plant defensins (Widjaja et al., 2010). In addition, some AMPs may be effectors
as well as regulators of other molecules. Plant lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) are ubiquitous
lipid-binding proteins involved in diverse stress responses; for example, 14 LTPs from
Tamarix hispida Willd. were screened over possible functions in response to various abiotic
stresses (Wang et al., 2009). Results showed that all 14 LTPs were expressed in roots, leaves
and stems, in different levels according to the organ; also, some of them were induced by
NaCl, PEG, NaHCO3, CdCl2 and ABA, suggesting novel roles beyond defense, and in abiotic
stress tolerance. In flower buds of Brassica campestris L. ssp. chinensis, a putative LTP of 103
amino acids was characterized as being a membrane protein with a signal peptide at the Nterminus, and strongly related to pollen viability and male sterility (Tian et al., 2009).
In the endosperm cells undergoing programmed cell death, LTPs have been described as
participating in recycling of endosperm lipids, or acting as protease inhibitors to protect
growing cotyledons from released proteases (Eklund & Edqvist, 2003).
The mode of action of AMPs on external pathogen or pest cells seems to hide still unknow
mechanisms: certain cyclotides are able to increase permeability across nematodes cuticle

262

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

layers, suggesting that one action of the such AMPs involves the interaction with the lipidrich epicuticle layer at the pathogen worm surface (Colgrave et al., 2010).

7. Towards biotechnological applications
Identification of plant defense genes against pathogens and environmental stresses provides
novelties to plant breeding, also genetic transformation (Vidal et al., 2003), mainly due crossactivity of distinct organisms AMPs that has significant potential in phytopatology and
plant resistance improvement. As already confirmed, insect-derived AMP gene is able to be
expressed in plant genome and its product can be correctly sorted in plant cell or tissue. The
metchnikowin, a 26-amino acid residue proline-rich AMP from Drosophila melanogaster, was
used for resistance in barley against pathogenic fungi (Rahnamaeian et al., 2009). In an
interfamily transfer, transgenic tobacco (Solanaceae) and peanut (Fabaceae) plants expressed
a defensin from mustard (Brassicaceae), effective against to phytopathogenic fungi
(Anuradha et al., 2008).
Many examples of structurally manipulated AMP followed by their transfer to crop plants
resulted in increased resistance against phytopathogens: about 18 sequence-optimized
AMPs have been transfected to plants with beneficial results for agricultural (Marcos et
al., 2008; Jan et al., 2010; Ma et al., 2010; Eggenberger et al., 2011). Plant-derived AMPs are
not just possible templates for bioactive molecule design, but candidates to
nanotechnologies applied to crop protection as inner content of nanocapsules to be used
in greenhouses or in the field to enhance plant resistance and or to control
phytopathogens, pests or parasitic weeds (Perez-de-Luque & Rubiales, 2009; PestanaCalsa et al., 2010; Imamura et al., 2010; Choi et al., 2009) or as integral domains fused to
another host organ/tissue targeted protein to local delivery of AMPs in transgenics
(Bryksa et al., 2010). Enginnered LTPs have the potential to be utilized as scaffolds to
design hydrophobic ligand biosensors or to serve as drug carriers (Choi et al., 2007).
Inclusion of plastid transformation technology to enhance yield of peptides accumulation
in molecular farming approaches is also very expected in next few years (Oey et al., 2009),
establishing another alternative to the production of next-generation antimicrobial
peptides in plants, from plants or non-plant source organism.
Novel bioactive molecules produced by plant growth-stimulator endophytes have been
comproved on suppressing the growth of bacterial and fungal plant pathogens, as the case
of TOMM, a thiazole/oxazole-modified microcin produced by the soil bacterium Bacillus
amyloliquefaciens. TOMM requires extensive posttranslational modification to become
bioactive against other bacteria, involving host plant factors to achieve such activity (Kajula
et al., 2010). How to solve this extensive need for proper peptide folding in other expression
systems remains another good question for next years. Probably, answers will come with
intensive in silico modeling to trial all theoretical three-dimensional intramolecular
interactions.
By the way, AMP-target interaction has been a recurrent bioinformatic issue in human
immunology and nutrition, concerning several allergenic AMPs. Immunodominance of
certain T-cells epitopes have been screened by modeling, helping breeders to achieve the
theoretical amino acid sequence of a given allergenic AMP that would have the lowest
allergenic potential (Oseroff et al., 2010). AMPs have also been tested and used for
medicine biotechnological applications, as cardiovascular functioning and diseases (Li,
2009).

In Silico Identification of Plant-Derived Antimicrobial Peptides

263

A biotechnological focus on plant AMPs with potentially high impact in biofuels industry
is the investigation of such peptides effects over bioethanol production, from alcoholic
fermentation by yeasts as well as from promising cellulolytic filamentous fungi species. In
both cases, it is likely that AMPs present in plant feedstock may still have inhibitory
activity on these industrial microorganisms, and so, over industrial yield (Nierop et al.,
2008). In the specific case of sugarcane and other potential crops for bioethanol
production in Brazilian northeast, as sorghum, Opuntia and other ‘caatinga’-adapted
plant species, research efforts have been directed to quantify this inhibition (if significant)
and to achieve alternative agronomical and/or breeding solutions to reduce it (Bioethanol
Research Network of Pernambuco).

8. Conclusion
As presented, antimicrobial compounds have been relatively well studied, since a long
period and usually from native traditional usage of plants. However, biological and
chemical bioinformatics have focused phytochemicals prospection and effects, while plant
antimicrobial peptides are left apart. Expansion of AMP prospection through in silico
methodologies is in perfect adjustment to the huge amount of biological data still not
screened. Several antimicrobial effects observed in some plant extracts may also be
explained due to AMPs supposed to be in sample, but such valuable information still has to
be generated in lab benches as well as in databases extensive computational analyses.
Plant biodiversity in natural and anthropical ecosystems provide almost infinite targets
number to unravel novel AMP candidates. Achieving such results relies on the generation of
molecular data from crop and wild plant species. “-Omics” based experiments will then be
more profitable and reliable, making easier the application of scientific knowledge from
molecular biology and bioinformatics to develop systems biology approaches in accordance
to nowadays and future needs in medicine, agriculture and industry.

1. Introduction
“Pathogen effector” has been increasingly used in the past decades in the plant-pathogen
interactions (Hogenhout et al., 2009).Presently, the definition of pathogen effector
commonly adopted the definition given by Sophien Kamoun, that is, effectors are
‘molecules that manipulate host cell structure and function, thereby facilitating infection
(virulence factors or toxins) and/or triggering defense responses (avirulence factors or
elicitors)’ (Kamoun, 2006). Plant and their related pathogen have coevolved for many
millions of years, which resulted in evolving some resistance genes in plants to prevent or
limit pathogen infection, and simultaneously pathogen also evolved some effector proteins
to overcome plant defense as well as cause disease. Many plant pathogens secreted effector
proteins into host cells to repress plant defense and contribute to pathogen colonization and
breach (Birch et al., 2006;Chisholm et al., 2006; Grant et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006 a, 2006 b;
Jones and Dangl, 2006; Kamoun, 2006; O’Connell and Panstruga, 2006).
Oomycetes could cause many destructive plant diseases, like potato late blight that caused
the Irish potato famine in the nineteenth century (Tyler, 2007). Oomycete effector proteins
could be translocated into host cells with the help of RXLR and dEER motifs in the absence
of the pathogen (Dou et al., 2008; Whisson et al., 2007).Oomycetes secreted effector proteins
into the infection site. The effector proteins were categorized into two classes based on
action site of effectors, and one was extracellular effectors acted in the apoplastic space
where they interact with extracellular molecules of hosts. The other was cytoplasmic
effectors that acted within the boundary of plant cell wall.
Plant fungal pathogen also secreted effector proteins into host cells where they incompatibly
interacted with plants receptors encoded by major resistance genes, which rapidly triggered
host defense response (Ellis et al., 2006; Tyler, 2002). Oomycete effectors play dual role in
disease and plant defense, fungal effector proteins were no exception. For example, victorin
of Cochliobolus victoriae, NIP1 of R.secalis, and AAL toxin of Alternaria alternate played the
role in toxin(Lorang et al., 2007; Navarre and Wolpert, 1999; Rohe et al., 1995; Spassieva et
al., 2002; van’t Slot and Knogge, 2002; Wang et al., 1996, Wolpert et al., 2002), but some
studies showed NIP1 and ToxA also interacted with corresponding host-resistance or toxinsensitivity genes, which resulted in NIP1 and ToxA acted in the same way as the Avr genes
(Schürch et al., 2004; Stukenbrock and McDonald, 2007). So, it is necessary to clarify fungal
effector proteins incompatibly or compatibly interact with host receptors when they were

274

transported into host cells. In the meanwhile, identification and functional assay of fungal
effectors-encoding genes will contribute to discovering mechanism for interaction and
coevolution of pathogens and plants. In this chapter, we will focus on our recent years’
studies on mining, sequence characterization and functional analysis of secreted effector
proteins in fungi and model plant of Arabidopsis thaliana.

2. Mining effector-encoding genes in Magnaporthe grisea genome database
Magnaporthe grisea is an ascomycete fungus and the causal agent of rice blast disease, which
is the most destructive disease of rice-growing areas in the worldwide. The annual rice yield
loss caused by blast disease is enough to feed about 60 million people (Ou, 1985).Wholegenome sequence indicated fungal and oomycete plant pathogen had large amounts of
secreted proteins (Dean et al., 2005; Kämper et al., 2006; Tyler et al., 2006).Magnaporthe grisea
genome sequence was available online, which facilitated to mining many novel effectorencoding genes. And some online software could be used to predict some features such as
secretion, domain and homology of effector protein. This provided some evidence for next
functional verification.
2.1 Predicting classically and non-classically secreted effector proteins in M. grisea
Secreted effector proteins are secreted from pathogen cell into extracelluar space. Secreted
proteins were categorized into two classes based on their secreted pathway, one was
classically secreted proteins, there was a signal peptide in N-terminal of proteins, and the
other was non-classically secreted proteins, their secreted pathway was known as leaderless
secretion (Nickel, 2003).
Classically secreted proteins in M. grisea were predicted through combined online
software such as SignalP v3.0, TargetP v1.01, big-PI predictor and TMHMM v2.0
(http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/ services/), the determinant standard of classically secreted
proteins conformed to the following four standards, the first standard is L=-918.235123.455×(Mean S score) +1983.44×(HMM score) and L>0 for predicting proteins with Nterminal signal peptide, the second one is proteins with signal peptides were transported
via Sec pathway, the third one is no transmembrane, the fourth one is no GPI-anchor site
(Samuel et al., 2003).
Total of 12,595 putative proteins including 1,486 small proteins from M. grisea database were
predicted. Of which, 1,134 putative proteins were predicted for classically secreted proteins
with N-terminal signal peptide. Their signal peptide length lied in between 15-45 amino
acids. Here, we will center on small secreted proteins (amino acid length <100), there were
119 classically secreted proteins among 1,486 small proteins, we selected 45 putative
secreted proteins-encoding genes among 119 genes as candidates in order to analysis their
polymorphism in blast strains from Yunnan, China, the results showed that the most of
genes distributed in 21 tested blast strains from Yunnan, which indicated high
polymorphism and conservative in blast fungus strains. In addition to classically secreted
proteins, non-classically secreted proteins were in further predicted using SecretomeP 2.0
Server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/).
2.2 Predicted features of secreted protein sequence
To conveniently identify function of predicted secreted effector proteins, sequence features
of secreted effector proteins needed to be predicted. The gene sequence prediction began

Mining Effector Proteins in Phytopathogenic Fungi

275

with the identification of regions of DNA that coded for expression of proteins. Whether
there was intron or not in DNA sequence for eukaryotic genome. Molecular weight of
immature protein was important for gene cloning and functional identification. For secreted
proteins, subcellular location was needed to be predicted, which contribute to understand
organelle in which secreted effector protein interacted with host receptors. In addition,
prediction of protein domain was necessary to experimentally assay function of protein in
future. For example, it was predicted that many effectors from plant pathogenic
Phytophthora species had N-terminal motifs (RXLR-dEER) that were necessary to translocate
these effectors into host cells (Jiang et al., 2008), along with the motif prediction, many
experiments such as oomycete effectors were translocated into host cells and their function
had been carried out, So, to some extent, domain or motif prediction experimentally
facilitated function identification of effector proteins.
We predicted subcellular location and domain of the parts of secreted proteins. For example,
MultiLoc/TargetLoc (http://www-bs.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/Services/MultiLoc/)was
used to predict subcellular location of 8 secreted proteins. The result showed that subcellular
location of MGS4 was predicted to be cytoplasmic, and MGS7, MGS11, MGS42, MGS53,
MGS60 and MGS174 were predicted to be extracellularly secreted. Theoretical pI of 7 secreted
proteins showed that they were predicted to lie in between 7.69-8.13 except MGS4 was 5.71,
and their theoretical molecular weight lied in between 8.50-10.70. Their domain prediction
revealed MGS7 possessed a transmembrane region, and MGS53 had a domain of ZnF-C2H2,
while other 5 proteins had no any typical domain except a signal peptide sequence contained
in N-terminal of proteins. The 8 secreted proteins sequences were searched using BLASTN or
BLASTX of NCBI nr database. No high similarity to sequences from other organism was
found, which revealed the effector-encoding genes were novel. Collectively, we analyzed
molecular weight, subcellular location, domain and homology of putative secreted proteins,
which provide a base for their functional prediction and identification.
2.3 Analysis of a Host-Targeting Motif and its flanking sequence in the genome of
Magnaporthe grisea
It is well-known that bacterial pathogens delivered effectors inside plant cells through the
type III secretion system (TTSS). The motif is primarily found in the pathogenic protein of
Plasmodium falciparum, termed RxLxE/D/Q, and its role is to target the host during the
export of virulence proteins; this motif is conserved in P. falciparum(Marti et al., 2004), and
is defined as host-targeting signal (HTS) or host-targeting motif (HTM). In P. falciparum
genome, this motif is detected within the 60 amino acids downstream of the secretion
signal sequence cleavage sites in approximately more than 400 proteins (Hiller et al.,
2004). Subsequently, a series of findings suggested that effectors from oomycete such as
Hyaloperonospora parasotica, Phytophthora infestans, Phytophthora sojae, and Phytophthora
ramorum possessed the conserved motif, termed RxLR, located within the N-terminal 60
amino acids downstream of signal peptide cleavage sites, which is similar in sequence and
position to the Plasmodium sp HTM, also the RxLR motif and HTM domains are
functionally interchangeable (Haldar et al., 2006; Bhattacharjee et al., 2006). In summary,
these findings indicated that these oomycetes shared conserved machinery for the
transport of effectors. Whether did the motif of RxLx exist in effectors from Magnaporthe
grisea? So, we predicted that the secretory proteins of M. grisea possessed the motif RxLx.
Here, we applied a tool of MEME (http://www.meme.sdsc.edu/) to analysis RxLx of 1,270
putative secretory proteins from the fifth edition of the rice blast fungus genome

276

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

(http://www.broad.mit.edu/ annotation/fungi/magnaporthe). The results showed that
297 putative secreted proteins possessed the motif of RxLx, the motif located within the
region of 100 amino acids downstream of the N-terminal signal sequence cleavage sites. The
number of secretory proteins with RxLx motif was similar with those of Plasmodium and
Oomycetes Host-targeted secretome, which indicated that the RxLx motif possibly function
as transporting of secreted proteins of M. grisea into host cells. However, biological
experiments are required for further verification.
Weblogo (http://weblogo.berkeley.edu/cache/fileDo8NeU.png) was used to analyze a
sequence logo of the MEME motif and its surrounding region of 149 putative secretory
protein sequences (Figure1). Arg(R) in position 1 and Leu (L) in position 3 were the most
highly conserved residues in the motif RxLx. It also showed the lower but possible finite
positional value, the other residues represented as ‘x’ in the linearized motif RxLx. By
contrast, the E/D/Q residues in the 5 amino acids core of the Plasmodium HTM and the
enrichment in E/D residues downstream and the highly conservation Arg(R) in position 4
in the motif RxLR that were required for function of motif RxLR were no positionally
conserved in secretory proteins containing motif RxLx of M.grisea.

Fig. 1. Sequence logo derived from 149 predicted secreted proteins of M. grisea
2.4 Functional prediction and analysis of RxLx motif-containing secretory proteins of
M. grisea genome
To analyze whether the RxLx motif-containing secretory proteins of M. grisea was involved
in pathogenicity, we compared the predicted proteins with the PEDANT database. By
manually comparing, there were putative ascribed functions of 62 RxLx motif-containing
secretory proteins of M. grisea (Table 1).These proteins had putative functions such as
proteins of MGG_11036, MGG_09159, MGG_09248, MGG_08401, MGG_09143, MGG_08424,
MGG_08537, MGG_07809,MGG_05479, MGG_06008 and MGG_09460 were possibly related
to cell wall degrading enzyme, proteins of MGG_00922, MGG_09817, MGG_08436,

MGG_03670 and MGG_03029 were related to proteinase activity, MGG_06662, MGG_00276,
MGG_08528, MGG_10805, MGG_11286 and MGG_10710 were related to oxidoreductase
activity, proteins of MGG_00238, MGG_10219 and MGG_14395 were associated to reverse

associated to post-translation modification and MGG_09848 was related to energy activity,
which suggested that seretory proteins with RxLx motif in M.grisea had diverse functions.
Interestingly, among them, some proteins involved in multiple cellular activity, such as
MGG_08164 encoded disulfide isomerase-like protein that involved in cell rescue, defense,
energy, development, cell fate and protein folding, modification, destination. In addition,
endoxylanse, chitin binding protein, xylanase, pheromone precursor encoded by
MGG_08401, MGG_09159, MGG_09248, MGG_08424, MGG_07733, respectively had been
reported that they involved in the pathogenicity of the rice blast fungus. Cellobiose

MGG_01943, MGG_08537, MGG_09839 and MGG_07809, respectively had previously been
shown to involve in pathogenicity of other plant fungi (Tudzynski and Sharon, 2003;
Mendgen et al, 1996).

3. Mining effector-encoding genes in other fungi genome database
Similarly, other fungi genome sequencing had been completed, many fungal genome
sequences such as Fusarium graminearum, Neurospora crassa, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and
Ustilago maydis were available online. We analyzed 10,082 proteins from Neurospora crassa
genome
database
(http://www.broad.mit.edu/ftp/pub/annotation/neurospora/
assembly3 /neurospora_3_protein.gz). There were 437 proteins with signal peptide
among total of 10,082 proteins through combined software such as SignalP, TMHMM,
TargetP and big-PI Predictior, their signal peptide length lied in between 15 and 59 amino
acids. There were 205 predicted secreted proteins that had functional description among
437 proteins, their function mainly involved in diverse enzyme, cell energy, transition, cell
recovered and defense mechanism. There were 284 secretory proteins through using
software to predict 6,522 protein sequences of U.maydis of 284 proteins, 90 proteins
contained functional description, and the minimum and maximum of open reading frame
were 324 bp and 13,347 bp, respectively. The length range of signal peptides ranged from
16-42 amino acids and the average length was 23 amino acids. Among 284 secreted
proteins, 56 proteins possessed the motif of RxLx that located within the region of 100
amino acids downstream of the N-terminal signal sequence cleavage sites.
Similarly, secreted proteins of Saccharomyces cerevisia were predicted. N-terminal amino acid
sequences of 6,700 proteins of S. cerevisiae were available on http://supfam.mrclmb.cam.ac.uk/SUPERFAMILY/cgi-bin/gen_list.cgi?genome=sc. Candida albicans secretome
data were from http://info.med.yale.edu/intmed/infdis/candida/Copyright (2003 John
Wiley&Sons, Ltd.). Through the internet-based software such as SignalP v3.0, TargetP v1.01,
Big-PI predictor and TMHMM v2.0 prediction for “typical” secretory proteins of S. cerevisiae,
the 163 secretory ones among the 6 700 proteins were obtained. One hundred and sixtythree predicted secretory proteins were regarded as “Sec-type” signal peptides based on
characteristics of four types signal peptides. C-domain of signal peptides of 163 secretory
proteins was recognized and cleaved by typeⅠSPases, and had common A-X-A motif, X
stood for any amino acid residue. The length and types of amino acid residues of signal
peptides were compared between 163 secretory proteins of S. cerevisiae and 283 ones of C.

albicans genome (Table 2 and Figure 2). The result showed that leucine, alanine, serine and
valine were found, percentage of leucine was equally 18% in signal peptides of both the two
eukaryotic secretomes, but percentage of alanine was 14% in signal peptides of S. cerevisiae
secretory proteins and 11% in signal peptides of C. albicans secretory proteins. Signal
peptides composed of a stretch of 19~21 residues in secretory proteins of both S. cerevisiae
and C. albicans. 19 residues composed of signal peptide in C albicans secretory proteins had
the highest frequency (16.8%), while 20 residues in S. cerevisiae secretory proteins had the
highest frequency (19.0%).

4. Mining effector-encoding genes in Arabidopsis thaliana genome database
Arabidopsis thaliana is the first plant genome that has been sequenced completely. At present,
secretome of Arabidopsis thaliana and their gene function categorization have not been
systematically reported. Here elementally report the prediction of secretome of Arabidopsis
thaliana and function categorization of gene encoding predicted secretory protein. Combined
the computer-based software such as SignalP v3.0, TargetP v1.01, big-PI predictor and
TMHMM v2.0 was used to predict the secretome of Arabidopsis thaliana. The result showed
that 282 secretory ones among 28,953 proteins were obtained, the proportion of predicted
secretory proteins to total proteins in entire genome was 2.86 % (Table3). And
sublocalization of 282 secretory proteins was further predicted through SubLoc v1.0, their
sublocalization was cytoplasmic, extracellular, mitochondrial and nuclear, most of them
were secreted into extracellular space, while a few of them were secreted into the other three
sublocalization (Table 4).
Based on gene function category (http://webclu.bio.wzw.tum.de/genre/proj/uwe25/
Search/Catalogs/searchCatFun.html?id=01), we categorized function of the putative
secreted proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana. The result showed the most of gene encoding
secreted proteins participated in cell metabolism, cell rescue and defense, cell transport, cell
fate and storage protein. Among the genes participated in cell rescue and defense, the ratio
of genes with functions of peroxidase, kinase, disease resistance protein, pathogenesisrelated protein and leucine-rich repeat protein was 50.79%.Among the genes participated in
cell metabolism, the ratio of genes with functions of hydrolase, lipase, carboxypeptidase,
invertase, transferase, expansin and synthase was 70.33%. It was noteworthy that 724
secretary proteins (18.8 %) were found among 3,848 plant-specific proteins in Arabidopsis
thaliana genome. Among 2,800 Arabidopsis genes that were reproducibly regulated in
response to bacterial pathogen inoculation, 132 genes were potential secretary proteins.
These results implied that many plant specific biochemical processes, including pathogen
responsive genes were carried out at extracellular space. Prediction of Arabidopsis thaliana
secretome by the aid of the related computer-based software will accelerate to the
experimentally functional study of secretome.

5. Expression pattern of effector protein-encoding genes from M. grisea
Many studies have used quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to evaluate fungal
growth during the infection process (Hu et al., 1993; Mahuku et al., 1995; Groppe and Boller,
1997; Judelson and Tooley, 2000).Therefore, we detected the expression pattern of candidate
novel genes MGNIP10, MGNIP18, MGNIP24, MGNIP34, MGNIP38, MGNIP53, MGNIP74,
MGNIP97 and MgNIP04 in different isolates from Yunnan, China, the same isolate grown
under nitrogen-starvation medium and complete medium and different time points when
Lijiangxintuanheigu challenged with blast fungus using real-time fluorescence quantitative
PCR.
All expression level of candidate genes were normalized by actin housekeeping gene and
quantified by both the comparative threshold method and standard curve method. The
results showed that expression level of all candidate genes were significantly different in

282

isolates of 94-64-1b Y99-63, 95-23-4a, Y98-16 and 94-64-1b. When two isolates of Y98-16 and
Y99-63 grown under complete medium and nitrogen-starvation medium, relative expression
quantity of genes was different. And expression of more genes was detected when two
isolates grew under nitrogen starvation for 24 h, comparing with when the two isolates
grew under complete medium (Figure 3).
We detected expression level of all candidate genes at 24 hpi, 48 hpi, 72 hpi, 96 hpi and 168
hpi, the result revealed that all genes expression level apparently up-regulated, and the
expression level achieved the maximum at 48hpi, the expression level had been decreasing
after 72hpi (Table 5 and Figure 4).

6. Pathogenicity analysis of secreted protein from the rice blast grown under
nitrogen-starvation medium
Fungi maintained their cell living and even growth through material reutilization when they
were in nutrition-stress environment. Some research showed that expression quantity of

Mining Effector Proteins in Phytopathogenic Fungi

pathogenicity-related genes increased when rice blast strains grew under nitrogenstarvation medium, which enhanced the pathogenicity of blast strains (Talbot et al., 1997).
The two isolates of Y99-63 and Y98-16 were from Yunnnan, China. And virulence test of two
isolates of Y98-16 and Y99-63 on rice isogenic lines of IRBL1-24 had been previously
performed in our lab, and virulence of Y99-63 was more intensive than Y98-16. To analyze
the virulence of extracellularly secreted proteins on rice varieties such as susceptible variety
of Lijiangxintuanheigu, resistant variety of Tetep and rice isogenic lines of IRBL1-24, we
separated the extracellularly secreted proteins when Y98-16 and Y99-63 grew under
nitrogen starvation for 48h, and man-made wounded rice leaves were inoculated with
extracellularly secreted proteins. The result showed that necrosis speck occurred around the
wounded leaves and wounded stems of rice when secreted proteins were inoculated on
leaves or stems for 48h, and speck diameter of leaves or stems treated with secreted proteins
was 2 to 4 folds larger than leaves or stems treated with sterilized water.
We compared difference of extracellularly secreted proteins from Y99-63 and Y98-16
growing under nitrogen-starvation medium for 48h using two-dimensional electrophoresis
technology. The result showed that more proteins spots were detected from Y99-63 growing
under nitrogen-starvation medium than Y98-16. And pI and molecular weight of secreted
proteins had an apparent difference between Y99-63 and Y98-16.

7. Summary
In this chapter, we have showed how mine the secreted proteins from fungi and plant, and
how predicted the some features of secreted proteins such as domain, pI, molecular weight
and sequence similarity. And simultaneously, we also introduced some experiments
centered on expression pattern of secreted protein-encoding genes, and pathogenicity
analysis of secreted proteins from the rice blast strains grown under nitrogen-starvation
medium.

1. Introduction
The advent of the omics area has created new research systems, including genomics,
proteomics, metabolomics, as well as the associated bio-informatics science, and databases.
At the same time, progress in traditional western medical research has reached a bottleneck,
as single compound drugs are costly to create, synthesize, or engineer. If we are to see real
and sustained progress in research, we must find approaches to utilize traditional remedies
to develop advanced medicines.
Instrumental systems for transcriptome, including the microarray of different messenger
RNA, microRNA and other non-gene sequence-related RNA products, have already been
developed; functional genomics studies using these systems have been remarkably
successful. However, the candidate genes involved in specific functions often need further
verifications for revealing their roles in the signal pathways. The difficulty may also arise
from the high variety and seemingly unrelated responsive genes and complex signaling or
regulatory systems involved.
Proteomic analysis has its disadvantages, although two-dimensional (2-D) gels can display
viable candidate proteins for study. Up to two thousand proteins of biological systems can
often be analyzed in sensitive 2-D gel systems. There are other proteins, such as cytokines or
chemokines of most leukocyte cells are expressed at relatively low levels, and often are not
detectable by 2-D gels. More sensitive methods, such as LC/MS and other fractionation
systems, need to be used for such cases.
Metabolomics faces an even greater challenge: a 2-D or one run display of the components
of a metabolome has not been defined and cannot be systematically evaluated. Therefore,
sequential analyses, e.g. the LC/MS followed by NMR, were developed to address the
“overall” or more comprehensive picture of metabolomes.
Several phyto-medicinal studies, including some in traditional Chinese herbal medicine
(TCM), have been considered as metabolome investigations. New strategies employing
omics approaches may be especially useful for phytomedicinal research, as conventional
phytomedicines often employ multiple components and they often are believed to interact
with multiple molecular targets related to cellular and physiological (e.g., immunemodulatory) effects. In order to successfully evaluate the effects of phytomedicines, various
omics approaches are being systematically combined. New computational and cross-

290

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

disciplinary analyses will be required for most experimental biology studies. Some
examples of systematic and technical considerations, in terms of research into the immunemodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects using the omics approaches, are addressed in this
brief review.
1.1 Importance of systems biology and bioinformatics
Scientists investigate medicinal plants in search of regulatory genes and metabolites that can
affect, modulate or upgrade the biological and metabolic processes, which in turn can confer
specific physiological or pharmacological functions. Recently, various high-output
technologies, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics, are
employed in such research effort [1-3]. Bioinformatics and systems biology approaches are
considered by many as needed to organize, manage, process, and understand the vast
amounts of data obtained in various omics studies [4-8]. In addition, systems biology is
aimed at understanding complex biology by integrating omics data from various sources for
network analysis, for evaluating the holistic system as a whole, as experimental results from
omics studies are most often not obtained or isolated as a single set of data points or evens
[9]. By analyzing the omics data, bioinformatics tools can help upgrade new approaches for
classifying and authenticating potential medicinal plants, identifying new bioactive
phytochemicals or compounds, and even improving medicinal plant species or cultivars
that can tolerate stressful environmental challenges.
The human immune system, as we currently conceptualize it, is under the tight control of a
complex network of regulatory genes, RNAs, modulatory proteins and stimulatory
metabolites. Past studies have often focused on understanding the roles of specific genes in
immune responses. To associate expression changes with immunological conditions such as
suppression, cancer, or autoimmunity, we can investigate the interrelationship of the upand down-regulation of genes or proteins patterns. Using microarray analysis and
comparative genomics, Hutton et al. [10] have identified genes and their regulatory
elements responsible for maintenance, differentiation, and the general functioning of
specific immune systems. In addition, most of the expression pattern of genes is related to
the biological role and effects of the products of genes, and a similar statement may be made
for protein expression [11]. Taken together, evaluation of gene and protein expression
profiles may lead us to identify links between specific genes or proteins and the associated
specific immuno-modularory effects. Moreover, omics technologies may also be employed
to address our views of the often-used concepts in immunology, such as: molecular
dynamics in response to specific stimulations or alterations of the molecular state of targeted
specific cells, in the hypothesis-driven research approach [12]. For instance, in the drug
discovery process, pharmaceutical companies have used various microarray systems as
screening tools to eliminate compounds that have molecular indications of toxicities before
preclinical and clinical testing [13]. In basic research, omics technologies have continually
improved our understanding on how drugs can regulate the immune system as well as of a
variety of issues in mechanistic or hypothesis-driven research [14-17]. The data obtained
from these studies not only may have significant impact on the future directions of those
specific lines of research but also may improve our understanding of the specific immunomodulatory regulation of given drugs.
Bioinformatics is the application of computational tools for biological sciences; its major aim
is the management and interpretation of biological data [18]. It has been an essential tool for

Immuno-Modulatory Effects of Phytomedicines Evaluated Using Omics Approaches

291

fully integrating and multi-disciplinary understanding the processes in various biological
areas [19]. Among them, understanding omics data requires both common statistical and
machine-learning methods, because the data are usually in high-dimensional form and
complexity. On the other hand, as compared with other biomedical and agricultural areas,
the study of omics and its use for research into medicinal plants are still in its infant stage.
Given the demand for studies on immuno-modulatory effects of herbal medicines, this
chapter introduces and summarizes the applications of some omics approaches and specific
bioinformatics tools for investigating phytomedicines.
1.2 Omics technologies
The technology platforms generally used in systems biology research, including
transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics, have enabled us to study living systems
from a holistic or integrative perspective through revealing profiles of multitudinous
biochemical components (Figure 1); it also opens up a unique opportunity to reinvestigate
phytomedicines [20]. The revolution of genomics research and technology development has
yielded complete or draft DNA sequence maps for a spectrum of species including human,
mouse and a serious of model organisms. Having the genomic data available, many new
‘drug-able’ targets based on transcriptomics study have been identified, opening up new
insights into explanations of biological systems at a global scale. Additionally, through
proteomics, we are witnessing the development of wonderful and multi-application tools
for studying various signaling or mechanism systems at the level of proteins and protein–
protein interactions [20, 21]. In the meantime, studies on glycol-biology and bioactive
polysaccharides are making great leaps in glycomics research; similarly, studies on
regulation and metabolic control of a spectrum of lipids are creating new approaches for
“lipidomics”. The recent wave of data from genomics and proteomics has precipitated the
measurement of increasingly a group or spectrum of elements to provide a systems
approach, especially at the level of metabolites and for the field of metabolomics.

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

Although omics are defined in several different ways today, in our opinion these systems
provide “an integrated approach to study biological systems not only for the intracellular,
but also at the cellular, organic and the whole body or organismic levels or networks,
through measuring and integrating the genomic, proteomic and metabolic data” in a global
consideration manner (Figure 1) [20, 22, 23].
In the search for new phyto-medicines, the necessary purification of single active
components has been in general successful, whereas synergetic effects of mixtures of
components (e.g., crude plant extracts) remain difficult to evaluate. Utilizing omics
technology, scientists hope to develop methods and models to detect and observe the effects
of complex mixtures such as various plant tissue extracts traditionally used in herbal
medicines. This applies especially to approaches employing metabolomics which adress
comprehensive phytochemical profiling, bioactivity phenotyping, sophisticated bio-organic
chemistry instrumentation, and new cross-talk experimental designs. This scenario needs
not only advancement in natural product research, but also revolutionary strategy in the
development of molecular pharmacology-based herbal medicines [20].
1.3 Phytomics
The term “Phytomics” has been previously created to the “omics-based approach” for
studying chemical compositions in plant (Kung PC et al., 2003), specifically: using
bioinformatics and/or statistics to address qualitative and quantitative aspects of chemical
compositions or profiles of the plant metabolites of our interest; or to develop databases for
addressing such aspects [24].

2. Transcriptomics study on medicinal plant research
2.1 Application of DNA microarrays in toxicogenomics, pharmacogenomics and
functional genomics studies of bioactivities from medicinal plants
Recent advances in genomics-based identification of responsive gene clusters, gene families or
gene polymorphisms associated, with immune system dysfunction have helped to address
some basic issues in immunology, and have begun to expand our understanding of immunerelated disease processes [13]. The application of omics technologies in toxicological research
(toxicogenomics) provided new insights into mechanisms of action, as well as data likely to be
useful for risk assessment [13, 25]. Gene chips or microarrays are already employed in
immunotoxicology research to identify biochemical pathways that are altered by specific
chemical exposures. For example, trichothecene mycotoxin deoxynivalenol has been shown in
mice to modulate splenic early responsive genes, which are functionally related to immunity,
inflammation and chemotaxis [15, 26], indicating the importance of innate immune systems,
including macrophages, granulocytes, neutrophils and various soluble mediators released in
the inflammatory response activated by the hexachlorobenzene treatment. For basic research, a
number of mechanistic studies have been performed towards gaining a comprehensive
understanding of the immunomodulatory properties of potential new drugs or drug leads.
Thymic atrophy, for instance, appears to be mediated in part by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-pdioxin (TCDD)-induced apoptosis [27]. Using an apoptosis-specific cDNA array combined
with promoter analyses, specific and novel gene targets have been shown to enhance negative
selection in the thymus and thus result in TCDD-induced thymic atrophy [16]. In a separate
study, cDNA microarray analyses were utilized to evaluate the TCDD regulation of Fas ligand
(FasL) promoter activity through modulation via NF-κB in thymic stromal cells and the
subsequent initiation of the apoptotic pathway in thymic T cells [28].

Immuno-Modulatory Effects of Phytomedicines Evaluated Using Omics Approaches

293

During the past decade there has been a paradigm shift from utilizing single-target drugs to
multi-target drugs [29, 30]. The concept of multi-targeted therapy was once believed to
better represent the conventional herbal medicine treatments that often employ multicomponent plant tissue extracts as natural products mixtures. However, very few phytomedicinal products have clear or systematic documentations comparable to that of
chemically synthesized drugs as single chemical compound. This situation has hampered
our ability to predict precise or specific molecular targets, signaling or action mechanisms of
activity, and possible side effects of “herbal drug” products [30]. With these requirements
for botanical and clinical uses, a validated genomics and metabolomics approach in
combination can be applied to quantify specific chemical markers and, subsequently, to
obtain chemically standardized extracts [31]. In addition, researchers have witnessed a wide
range of molecular mechanisms governing various cellular and tissue behaviors. The
genomics approach with integrations of large and diverse sources of gene, protein and
metabolite expression information will assist in making comprehensive and integrated
predictions about the pharmacological effects of plant natural products [32].
While numerous laboratories use genomics in their investigation of underlying mechanisms
of immunotoxicity, few have employed genomic analyses as a screening tool. Many
differentially expressed genes are known to play a role in apoptosis, host defense, cell
growth and differentiation, and trafficking of specific cells in body fluid systems. In the
spleen, these may include the up-regulation of IL-18, lymphotoxin B receptor, and colonystimulating factor receptor, and down-regulation of RANTES and histocompatibility
antigens [15, 33-35]. In the thymus, gene changes included the down-regulation of nuclear
factor of activated T cells, interferon gamma receptor, and T cell transcription factor 7, and
the up-regulation of caspase 1 and ApoE. These findings are consistent with alterations
previously observed in specific immune functions [34, 36] and could further expand our
knowledge at gene regulation level.

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

Applications of DNA microarray technologies in herbal drug research may be classified into
three major areas. Firstly, it can be used in pharmacodynamics to aid the discovery of new
diagnostic indicators and biomarkers for therapeutic response, elucidation of molecular
mechanisms of herbal action, its formulations or its phytochemical components, and in
identification and validation of new molecular targets for herbal drug development (Figure
2) [30], [37]. Secondly, it is applicable in toxicogenomics for predicting side effects of a
medicinal herb or phytomedicine lead drug during preclinical activity and safety studies,
conferring drug safety or resistance [38]. Thirdly, it is useful for botanical or plant
identification and authentication of crude plant materials as part of an effort and regulatory
system for standardization and quality control [39]. Given these considerations, DNA
microarrays may thus offer powerful predictive functions at different stages of a typical
drug/phytomedicine discovery pipeline.
2.2 Immuno-modulatory effects of different phyto-compounds/candidate
phytomedicines
With the increased demand for validated herbal products for medicinal use comes the need
to better understand the molecular mechanisms of their biological activities. Although many
reputed herbal drugs are investigated at the molecular level, it remains difficult to realize
the exact targets of individual phytochemical components and how these molecules together
or independently can contribute to specific immuno-modulatory effects. Here, we discuss
findings from some of the recent studies on microarray-based gene expression aimed at
elucidating immune-regulatory mechanisms of pure phytochemicals as well as specific
herbal extracts.
2.2.1 Purified compounds or specific phytochemical groups
The Chinese medicinal herb root Tripterygium hypoglaucum has been subjected to cDNA
microarrays containing 3000 human genes (derived from a leukocyte cDNA library) in order
to study its role in apoptosis-inducing activity of plant alkaloids. Apoptosis induced by
these T. hypoglaucum alkaloids was shown to be mediated through c-myc and NF-kappa B
signaling pathways [40]. In an animal model of aged rat, gene chip (Rat Genome U34A)
analysis was applied to evaluate the gene regulatory pattern of Epimedium flavonoids in
immune homeostasis. Epimedium flavonoids were found to reverse the “abnormal” or aging
changes, allowing reconstruction of a beneficial equilibrium in gene expression and thus
further remodeling of the immunohomeostasis in the aged rat [41]. Taken together, results
from these studies indicate that the expression pattern characterized by up-regulation of
specific apoptosis-promoting genes and down-regulation of certain apoptosis-inhibiting
genes can be considered as important genomic background of an immunohomeostasis
imbalance [30].
A traditional Chinese medicinal (TCM) herb prescription, Si-Jun-Zi decoction (SJZD), has
been administered in a clinical setting to patients with disorders of the digestive system.
Previous studies have indicated that the polysaccharides of SJZD are active components of
the phyto-extract mixture in improving gastrointestinal function and immunity [42]. SJZD
polysaccharides also had a protective effect and enhanced re-epithelialization on wounded
IEC-6 cells. To further elucidate this effect at the molecular level, an oligonucleotide
microarray was employed to study differential gene expression of SJZD-treated IEC-6 cells.
There was, indeed, increased expression of genes encoding for ion channels and
transporters, known as critical to cell migration and restoration of wounded cells,

suggesting a mechanism for re-epithelialization as well as improved immunity [43]. These
studies demonstrate the useful approach of functional genomics for research into
modernization of TCM.
Shikonin and its derivatives, from the TCM-claimed medicinal herb Lithospermum
erythrorhizon, have been shown to possess numerous beneficial pharmacological properties,
including anti-inflammatory and antitumor properties [44, 45]. In our previous report,
shikonin was shown to confer a potent bioactivity on suppression of TNF-α promoter
activity [46]. Additionally, shikonin was found to mediate cytokine expression through
inactivation of the RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) pathway [46]. It was also suggested
from the reports that regulation of TNF-α pre-mRNA splicing may constitute a promising
target for future anti-inflammatory application [47]. Moreover, the functional genomic
(DNA microarray) analysis on the cellular immunological effects of shikonin effectively
distinguished the complex and specific bioactivities of this phyto-compound in human
monocytes [48]. Further, ubiquitin pathway regulator, e.g., Rad23A, was also identified as
possible key regulators for this shikonin effect [48]. A transcriptomics approach has
therefore been instrumental in screening immune-modulatory effects of noteworthy
phytocompounds. These studies have set useful examples for future systematization of key
traditional herbal medicine-derived phytomedicines.
2.2.2 Medicinal herbal extracts
Screening of the human genome for TNF-α-inducible genes has been used to identify the antiinflammatory effects of 5-Loxin, a standardized Boswellia serrata extract, in microvascular
endothelial cells [49, 50]. It was shown that 113 out of the 522 TNF-α-induced genes were
responsive to 5-Loxin treatment. These genes are directly or apparently related to
inflammation, cell adhesion, and proteolysis. These robust 5-Loxin-sensitive candidate genes
were subjected to further evaluation for molecular signaling, and this processing led to the
suggestion of the primary 5-Loxin-sensitive TNF-α-inducible pathways. Mechanistically, 5Loxin can completely inhibit VCAM-1 expression, and TNF-α can cause inflammation by
strongly up-regulating the expression of this adhesion molecule VCAM-1. [49].
Recently, genomics analysis has also evolved for evaluation of the efficacy of bioactive
chemicals in natural health products as therapeutics, for instance, with regard to the
alleviation of specific inflammatory activities in human airway epithelial cells [33]. In
addition, one application of gene expression profiling in this research field may be the
growing appreciation for the multiple and pivotal roles played by various dendritic cells
(DCs) in initiating and regulating a spectrum of immune responses. These cells are
responsible for recognizing and processing various antigens and their ultimate presentation
to specific immune cell (e.g., T cells) systems [51-53]. It has been well established that DCs
present in the epidermis (Langerhans cells (LCs)) are required for the presentation of
chemical allergens at the skin’s surface, as well as for skin sensitization [54, 55].
Investigations by Enk and Katz [56] have revealed that topical exposure of mice to chemical
allergens, but not to a non-sensitizing skin irritant, caused numerous changes in expression
of cytokines and chemokines by LC and local epidermal cells. Among these changes
recorded following allergen treatment was a rapid increase in LC expression of mRNA for
interleukin-1β (IL-1β), a cutaneous cytokine necessary for the regulation of LC function and
for skin sensitization [56-59]. These results concluded that changes in the expressions of IL1β by LC in response to chemical allergens might hence provide a practical and efficient in
vitro approach for identifying skin-sensitizing chemicals [60].

296

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

Genome-wide analysis has been adopted as a less selective approach for measuring the
holistic or global changes in gene expression [17, 61-64]. It can be anticipated that the
activation and functional maturation of DCs, as drastic cellular activities, are likely to be
associated with changes in the levels of a spectrum of gene expressions that are responsible
for: (a) intracellular metabolic processes; (b) control of cell motility (including those
regulating intercellular communication and interactions with the tissue matrix); (c) cytokine
and chemokine production, and (d) cell growth regulation and survival [17, 61]. Results of
our previous studies on the immune-modulatory effects of a phytocompound mixture,
extracted from the butanol fraction (BF) of a stem and leaf (S+L) extract of Echinacea
Purpurea ([BF/S+L/Ep]), suggest that [BF/S+L/Ep] can effectively modulate DC mobility in
vivo and related cellular physiology in the mouse immune system. In addition, [BF/S+L/Ep]
modulated cell adhesion-, cell mobility-, cytokine- and NF-κB signaling- related activities in
primary cultures of mouse DCs [17]. Similar study of Wang et al [60], have further shown
that genes expressed in [BF/S+L/Ep]-treated human DCs revealed a key-signaling network
involving a number of immune-modulatory molecules and lead to the activation of a
downstream molecule, adenylate cyclase 8. These examples show that genomics approaches
can be usefully employed for predicting candidate target molecules in future translational
studies of phytochemicals, phytocompound mixtures, and medicinal herbal extracts.
2.3 Use of cDNA microarray/ expression sequence tags (ESTs) for evaluating
bioactivities of medicinal plants
A transcriptome is the set of all detectable RNA molecules, including mRNA, tRNA, rRNA,
and non-coding RNAs (e.g., siRNA, microRNA) produced in a group of test cells or tissues.
By using the advanced transcriptomics, an organism’s entire transcriptome can now be
effectively analyzed for many experimental systems. Technically, transcriptomics is a
technology to reveal genome-wide gene expression profiles, patterns, integrated or
segregated features or networks describing a global view or analysis of gene expression
activities of the genome at the mRNA or regulatory RNA levels. These technologies
comprise cDNA-AFLP, SAGE, cDNA microarray (or gene chip), oligonucleotide-microarray,
and microRNA microarray [2]. Microarrays also have been used to detect gene expression
changes of medicinal plants in a variety of developmental stages, geographic locations,
natural growth environments, and/or cultivation conditions [2]. In phytomics studies,
studies have aimed to identify the responsive genes that are regulated by active medicinal
compounds, anti-pathogen infection, or adaptation to harsh environment [65].
To design appropriate probe sequences for a DNA microarrays efficiently, we need to
consider the genome sequence information for a specific organism in its entirety or with a
definable set or subset. However, since only very limitted genomes of medicinal plants have
currently been sequenced, one alternative is to gather the necessary transcriptome
information, by generating or making use of existing expression sequence tags (ESTs) [66,
67]. Increasing numbers of EST libraries from medicinal plants such as Panax quinquefolius
[68], Huperzia serrata [69], P. Notoginseng [70], Rehmannia glutinosa [71], and Catharanthus
roseus [72] have been recently obtained. An automatic system for large scale EST sequence
retrieval, assembly, and functional and pathway analyses has been established [73]. This
system has been successfully applied to analyzing both plant [74] and animal EST sequences
[73, 75]. These EST and annotation systems have provided a good foundation for design of
suitable arrays for representative genomes or focused transcriptomics, hence providing
valuable information for genomic research into phytomedicine.

3. Proteomics studies on the research into medicinal plants
3.1 Use and advancement of analytical and instrumentation systems: Twodimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), electrospray ionization, matrix-assisted laser
desorption/ionization and surface-enhanced laser desorp
The Nobel Prize in Chemistry for 2002 was shared between scientists from two research
expertise: mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). These
revolutionary breakthroughs have allowed chemical biology to become one of the most
significant scientific disciplines in recent years. Scientists can now rapidly and reliably
identify most proteins in a relatively small sample and readily produce three-dimensional
display and/or images of expressed protein molecules with highly resolution. With these
advancements, various experimental approaches and technologies were developed to obtain
a better understanding of proteins and their regulatory effects on molecular and cellular
functions of various biological systems [76, 77]. Among them, technologies including twodimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) analysis [78, 79], matrix-assisted laser
desorption/ionization (MALDI)- time-of-flight (TOF) [80] and Surface-Enhanced Laser
Desorption/Ionization (SELDI)-TOF MS [81] have been broadly used in proteomics studies
on the research of medicinal plants.
3.2 Application of proteomics for research into traditional herbal medicine
Proteomics technologies were applied to simultaneously study the function, organization,
diversity, and the dynamic variety of total or a subset of proteins at the cellular or tissue
levels [21]. The current integrative approach used in proteomics is in line with the practice
and holistic philosophy of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Recent advances in
multidimensional liquid chromatography, coupled with free-flow electrophoresis and
capillary electrophoresis-based separation techniques, make it possible in separation of
hundreds or even thousands of protein components in some medical plants [82, 83]. We
may able now to explore an increased understanding of such complex mixtures and the
reputed medicinal effects at the cellular and molecular levels through proteomics studies; it
holds a key to the big demand for modernization and internationalization of a number of
traditional phyto-medicines [83]. In this article, some of the proteomics approaches in TCM
research and development are addressed, highlighting the application in mechanistic
investigation of specific phytomedicines.
Panax ginseng and Panax quinquefolius are two of the valued herbs widely used in TCM.
Conventional separation methods were unable to distinguish the different plant parts
(main root, lateral roots, rhizome head and epidermal tissues) between these two species.
On the other hand, when 2-DE maps were employed, plant tissue samples containing
distinct or common protein species (spots) can be easily discriminated or distinguished.
Clearly, these potential protein biomarkers may also facilitate the identification processes
for various medicinal plants that may be difficult to identify morphologically or
anatomically [84].
Numerous herbal medicines have been reported to have immunomodulatory and antitumor effects in cancer cells [85-87]. Recent biological and pharmaceutical researches have
shown that diosgenyl saponins may exert a large variety of biological functions, with a
potential for use in cancer chemoprevention [88]. By using 2-DE, tryptic in-gel digestion and
MALDI-TOF MS analysis, Wang et al. [89] suggested that dioscin, a saponin extracted from
Polygonatum zanlanscianense Pamp., exhibited cytotoxicity towards human myeloblast
leukemia HL-60 cells. This proteomics analysis also revealed that the expression of

298

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

mitochondria-associated proteins was substantially altered in HL-60 cells upon dioscin
treatment, suggesting that mitochondria were the major cellular and organelle target of
dioscin cytotoxicity. Moreover, the results indicated that other pathways were likely also
involved in detected dioscin cytotoxicity, including phosphorylation-based cellular
signaling, RNA-related protein synthesis, and oxidative stress processes. The study
demonstrated the benefits of using a proteomics approach in anticancer phytomedicine
research [90].

4. Metabolomics study on the research of medicinal plants
Metabolomics, including both targeted and global metabolite profiling strategies, is
rapidly becoming a popular and powerful approach of choice across a broad range of
medical and biological sciences including systems biology, drug discovery, and molecular
and cell biology [24]. Specifically for human metabolites, it is believed that at least 3,000
metabolites that are essential for normal growth and development (primary metabolites)
and >2000 secondary metabolites that are not essential for growth and development but
may help fight off infection and other forms of stress on the body [91]. In addition,
metabolomics are now being generally considered a vital component of the systems
biology approach, in which it can reflect and connect the genotypes with diverse yet
specific phenotypes of specific types of cells, tissues, or organs [91]. Within the past
decade, the number of publications of metabolomics-related research articles has
increased from roughly 40 in 2002 to 100, 170, 200 and >250 articles in the years 2004,
2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. Now it is estimated that >300 articles, with a general
aim or study on metabolomics were published annually in 2010. Owing to its remarkable
versatility, metabolomics is rapidly becoming a universal tool and key component in
medical research [24]. Combined with genomics and proteomics technologies, systems
biology research using metabolomics investigates characteristic molecular signatures for
disease diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutics [92]. This section reviews the recent
developments in technology platforms and experimental approaches for metabolomics
studies in the research of immunomodulatory properties of potential medicinal plants.
4.1 Use of GC-MS, LC- MS, FT-IR and NMR technologies
Currently, the term ‘metabolomics’ often can be used interchangeably with “metabolite
profiling” because the type of one-step, two dimensional exhibition analysis used in
genomics and proteonomics experiments is not possible at the present time, as the
complexity of chemicals in most biological systems, especially in plants, is highly diversified
and can be enormous [93]. The two basic approaches in metabolomics can be classified the
targeted- and the global metabolite analyses. Targeted metabolite analysis, (or metabolite
profiling), as the name implies, targets mainly a subset of metabolites in test sample, instead
of a complete, global metabolome analysis, often by using a particular set of analytic
technique(s) such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid
chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and yields an estimate of quantity [94].
Metabolomics approaches using GC–MS, LC–MS, or 2D NMR are effective tools for quality
control of medicinal plants or herbal medicine products [95, 96]. As shown in Figure 3 [24],
key aspects of the technology were assembled in many research institutions as “core
labs/facilities” in the metabolomics approach for herbal medicine or other integrated
research interest. Various other technical systems, methodologies or techniques, including

Immuno-Modulatory Effects of Phytomedicines Evaluated Using Omics Approaches

299

thin layer chromatography (TLC), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Raman
spectroscopy and NMR [97-99] are also important research facilities in the metabolite
analysis arsenal.

Fig. 3. Key features of metabolomics technologies employed for research into
phytomedicines [24].
Mass spectrometry is currently the most broadly applied technology in metabolomic
studies. Among the variety of MS techniques, GC-MS has long been popularly used in
metabolite profiling of plant extracts [100, 101]. Rapid, high-resolution 2D GC x GC-TOF MS
has been employed in the phenotyping of natural rice variants [102] as well as for efficient
quality control or analysis of herbal medicines [95]. Recently, capillary electrophoresis-MS
has also been developed as a metabolomics tool, capable of simultaneously analyzing over
1,000 charged chemical species, a technique that is expected to create a number of obvious
applications in processing and characterization of various biological samples [95]. A
shotgun approach using MALDI-TOF/TOF MS has recently been established for rapid
analysis of negatively charged metabolites in mammalian tissues to: (a) facilitate the
detection of low-abundant metabolites such as cAMP, cGMP, and IP3; and (b) discriminate
isomeric molecular species [103]. In addition, novel instrumentation/equipment set ups
developed recently, such as Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry
(FT-MS), represents a quantum jump in the new capabilities of mass spectrometers for
metabolite analysis. Due to the exceptionally high resolution of these instruments,

300

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

metabolites with mass differences of less than 2 ppm can now be separated on a
chromatographic time scale (Van der Greef et al., 2004). The accurate results obtained can
help reveal elemental compositions, which often enable unequivocal metabolite
identification.
Remarkable recent developments in analytical biochemistry regarding the detection and
characterization of compounds with small molecular mass, such as MS and high-field NMR
coupled with user-friendly multivariate statistics, have led to highly efficient systems for
comprehensive analysis of the metabolite data matrices generated by metabolomics
experiments [104]. One-dimensional (1D) NMR spectrometry has shown its capability for
high-output analysis and classification of chemically similar groups of test samples. At the
same time, the large numbers of overlapping peaks generated by such method may also
hinder in some case accurate identification of specific metabolites. Recently, a replacement
for the 1D 1H NMR spectroscopic technology also has been developed: a two-dimensional
(2D) 1H–13C NMR strategy (fast metabolite quantification, FMQ, by NMR), was developed
for analyzing metabolites as multivariate statistical objects [105].
The new ‘hyphenated’ techniques that combine in assay sequence various forms of liquid
chromatography with NMR, such as HPLC-SPENMR, have effectively improved the
sensitivity of NMR analyses and can be employed to characterize both high- and lowabundant metabolites in complex crude plant extracts [106, 107].
4.2 Metabolomics research in medicinal chemistry studies
Diverse secondary plant metabolites are believed to have evolved through continuous
interactions with challenging and predominantly hostile environments, including both
abiotic and biotic stresses. When these features are coupled with characteristic species and
agronomic differences, various phyto-chemicals as secondary metabolites generally can
confer various specific bioactivities related to their biochemical structures [108]. These
bioactivities apparently can help the host plants to defend specific plant pathogens and to
reduce a spectrum of abiotic stresses, e.g., drought, heat and saline conditions. Interestingly,
these secondary plant metabolites often were also found to confer potent and valuable
bioactivities for defending human sickness, including viral, cancerous and inflammatory
diseases. Some well-known cancer chemotherapeutic drugs have been initially derived from
plant secondary metabolites, such as paclitaxel (taxol), camptothecin (irinotecan, topotecan),
and podophyllotoxins (etoposide, teniposide) [24, 109]. Recent re-recognization of the vast
potential of plant secondary metabolites or natural products to serve as lead compounds for
drug discovery and development, or as various general health care products, has renewed a
lot of interest in pharmaceutical and nutraceutical research. De novo combinational
chemistry has so far produced only a very limited number of novel drugs, the natural
products and their derivatives are still considered by many scientists to be the primary
source of leads for drug development [110]. In this area, the use of whole plants or their
extracts as medicines gave way to the isolation of active phyto-compounds, beginning in the
early 19th century with the isolation of morphine from opium. In such a reductionist
approach, however, single active phytocompounds may often be not identifiable because of
their low abundance in test plant extracts, or alternatively, a spectrum of pharmacological
efficacy traditionally observed arises only as a synergistic action of the multiple but specific
ingredients present in a single plant or even from a multiple medicinal plant formulation, as
in TCM [111, 112].

Immuno-Modulatory Effects of Phytomedicines Evaluated Using Omics Approaches

301

To efficiently link the flood of experimental data and specific metabolites or general
metabolite profiles information to biology and metabolism study systems, traditional
bioinformatics is being combined with cheminformatics to generate a basic computational
infrastructure for analysis of metabolomics [113, 114]. A number of metabolomics
databases, some based on both chemical and biological/biochemical data, have been
made publicly available [114]. The Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) is currently the
largest and most complete database in breadth and depth, offering spectral, physicochemical, clinical, biochemical, genomic, and metabolism information for a library of
>2500 known human metabolites [115, 116]. Other databases include the BioMagResBank
(BMRB) with an emphasis on NMR data (>270 pure compounds), the Madison
Metabolomics Consortium Database (MMCD) which presents MS and/or NMR data on
more than 10,000 metabolites [117], and the Golm Metabolome Database (GMD) which
has been specifically designed for plant research and utilizes GC–MS data [118].
Additionally, Wishart [113] has reviewed the development of algorithms and innovations
in informatics concerning data reduction, normalization, and alignment that offer
sufficient biological insight into metabolic profiles.
4.3 Metabolomics approach applied to research into immuno-modulatory effects of
phytomedicine
It is now generally accepted that chronic inflammation is a key factor in the development of
many types of cancers. Natural products, especially from plants, were once popular choices
in cancer therapeutics based on their immunosuppressive or anti-inflammatory effects [110,
119-121]. Recently, metabolomics has been effectively used to characterize and monitor
carcinogenesis activities in mouse models [122]. In addressing oncology metabolomics,
NMR was used to target biomarkers for prostate cancer by analyzing metabolites with antiinflammatory effects in the development and progression of this cancer for better future
management [123, 124]. This metabolomics approach has also been successfully
implemented to monitor the metabolism in human brain, liver tumors, lymphomas, and
colon cancers [125].

5. Comparative and bioinformatics tools for omics studies
5.1 Ingenuity (http://www.ingenuity.com/)
Functional genomics experimental approaches were employed in our previous studies on the
modulatory effect of Echinacea plant extracts (e.g., the butanol-fractionated Leaf and Stem
tissue extract designated as BF/S+L/Ep) on both mouse and human DCs [17, 63, 64]. Using
the same defined phytochemical extracts in the study, we analyzed the genome-wide
transcriptional response in the context of known functional activities and interrelationships
among specific protein molecules and/or different cell phenotypes. Ingenuity systems, a
structured network knowledge-based approach, provided us good tools and insight into the
regulation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cell activities relevant to the body’s immune
system. Figure 5 shows candidate molecular networks revealed by clustering analysis of the
representative genes involved in the BMDC response to [BF/S+L/Ep] treatment [17]. The
prototypical cell was constructed from 37 representative genes that responded to treatment
with [BF/S+L/Ep] in vitro from 4 hours to 12 hours. Genes whose expression was upregulated
(more than doubled) are indicated in red, and those whose expression was downregulated (to
less than half) are shown in green. Selected regions of the network highlight three groups of

302

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

genes. Group 1: Immune response-related genes. Group 2: Adhesion molecules and
cytoskeleton; cell movement related genes. Group 3: Cell cycle, cell proliferation and apoptosis
related genes. Gene networks were analyzed using the Ingenuity Pathways program.

Fig. 5. Pathway analysis of representative genes that responded to [BF/S+L/Ep] treatment [17].
5.2 Metacore™ (http://www.genego.com/metacore.php)
MetaCore™ is another integrated knowledge database and software suite for pathway
analysis of experimental data and gene lists. In the research of phytomedicines, it has
also been used to evaluate the possible hierarchical control of microRNA expression from
mouse tissues in order to identify trends of miRNA and mRNA expressions in response to
targeted phytomedicinal treatment. Utilizing Metacore software, a prototypical network
was constructed from 6 representative microRNAs that responded to treatment in vivo
with specific phyto-chemicals (Figure 6). All selected microRNAs were found to be
down-regulated to less than half of the untreated levels, and are shown with blue circles.

Fig. 6. Pathway/network analysis of representative microRNAs which are responsive in vivo
to a specific single phytocompound treatment in inflammed mouse tissues.

Immuno-Modulatory Effects of Phytomedicines Evaluated Using Omics Approaches

Specifically, connections (hits) within 6 microRNAs were employed as the parameter for this
specific search. Arrows indicate the cross talks among five key molecules/pathways, (TCF8,
VEGF-A, FOG2, MIG6, SIP1 and WASF3), and there are postulated to be regulated by
treatment with a specific phyto-chemical from TCM formulation.
5.3 TRANTHPATH (http://www.gene-regulation.com/index.html)
TRANSPATH, a database system about gene regulatory networks, combines encyclopedic
information on signal transduction with tools for visualization and analysis. By integrating
with TRANSFAC, a database about transcription factors and their DNA binding sites,
TRANSPATH can predict putative signaling pathways from ligand to target genes and their
products, which may themselves be involved in a regulatory action.
For studying specific imumodulatory effect of herbal medicine, the possible signaling
pathways, networks or potential interactions among the responsive genes/target molecules in
DCs treated with Echinacea extracts [BF/S+L/Ep] was assessed by using such Transpath
software. This bioinformatics analysis has predicted a key-signaling network involving a
number of immune-modulatory molecules leading to the activation of a very important
downstream regulatory molecule, the adenylate cyclase 8, effectively in regulating cAMP
levels in mammalian cells. This analysis indicated two postulated key molecules/pathways,
Adenylate cyclase (AC8) and calmudulin (CaM), responsive to the Echinacea extracts (Figure 7).

Fig. 7. Bioinformatics analysis of [BF/S+L/Ep] bioactivity and the underlying candidate
molecular signaling networks in human DCs. The 20 genes that were up- or down-regulated
at least 5-fold over controls were analyzed. Specifically, connections (hits) within 7 genes
were employed as the parameter for the current search [63].

304

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

5.4 KEGG (http://www.kegg.jp/kegg/)
KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) is a multi-functional bioinformatics resource
for linking genomes to metabolic activities. It consists of 16 main databases and has been
widely used as a reference knowledge base for biological interpretation of large-scale datasets
generated by sequencing and other high-throughput experimental technologies. Among these
databases, the KEGG DRUG database contains crude drugs (consisting of multiple chemical
compounds) and formulas (consisting of multiple crude drugs) in the Traditional Chinese
Medicine (TCM). In addition, KEGG PATHWAY and KEGG ENVIRON are also being
organized to interpret and correlate relationships between genomic and chemical information
of various natural products/metabolites from plants. For example, the biosynthetic pathway
of stilbenoids, a group of phenolic compounds, was provided for revealing specific molecular
interaction and different reaction networks (Figure 8). Although the knowledge on
biosynthetic pathways of plant natural products is in general largely incomplete, the genomic
information is expected to provide clues to missing enzymes and reactions for biosynthesis of
specific plant secondary metabolites, the source for future modernized phytomedicines, either
as pure compounds, fractionated phytochemical mixtures, or as crude plant extracts.
Moreover, the genomic information may also uncover the architecture of biosynthetic
pathways for generating chemical diversity of natural products.

6. Challenges and perspectives
Traditionally, the pharmaceutical research and industries have focused on evaluating or
monitoring individual gene, proteins as the target or basis for identifying new drugs. The

Immuno-Modulatory Effects of Phytomedicines Evaluated Using Omics Approaches

305

quest for single molecules to modify single key factors in a disease process is now
recognized as may not be able to provide a solution for a spectrum of diseases in which
multiple cell types, target molecules and/or multiple pathways are known or believed to
contribute to the diseases. Herbal extracts/mixtures as conventional phytomedicines may
represent the combinational chemistry of the nature of traditional medicines, and
encompass a vast repertoire of chemical entities that may have anecdotally and empirically
found through long human culture history to confer a complex and yet integrated effect on
numerous cellular components and functions, effecting a medicinal activity. Various
traditional herbal drugs may thus have good potential for re-invention and newly found use
in the multi-target approach in treating various diseases. However, such potential of herbal
drugs is undermined by difficulties in standardization, and the pharmacodynamics and
pharmacokinetics studies of these multicomponent plant extract mixtures. Microarray
analysis of gene expression profiles may be useful for elucidating such complex molecular
mechanisms and networks underlying the multi-target pharmacological functions of herbal
extracts and phytomedicine mixtures. Research into the patterns of gene expression at a
range of stages during the treatment process may reveal key targets and mechanisms and
help to identify biomarkers of either adverse- or favorable response. A positive correlation
between the transcriptional response induced by a putative or candidate herbal drug and
the database profile of an existing pharmaceutical or therapeutic agent as a single chemical
may provide us insight into the target specificity, mechanism of action, as well as in
facilitating analysis of signaling pathways downstream of the specific target. This
information could in turn be used to interpret possible bioactivity, function or effectiveness
of test phytomedicines. In addition, various DNA, RNA or protein microarrays may also be
used for bioactivity-guided fractionation of herbal extracts, thereby narrowing in the active
principles delivering the desired or observed effect. Microarrays may also improve the
power for selection of biological targets and lead compounds up or down the drug
discovery pipeline. Once useful transcriptome or/and proteome data from herbal drug
candidates can be correlated with in vivo bioactivity or preclinical or “existing clinical” (as in
some TCM) response outcomes (biomarkers) in defined biological systems, the best
candidates can then be selected for further drug development [30].
Although some DNA microarrays have already offered impressive potential for
pharmacodynamics and toxigenomics applications, they are still being considered as in an
exploratory stage and the data obtained from them will need validation by other biological
experiments. Bioinformatics and statistical tools have a major role to play in analysis of the
microarray results, whereby data from multiple experiments can and may need to be
integrated to address complex biological activities, functions or effects. Another factor
currently limiting microarray application is the cost of this technology [30]. The challenge
we face today is to develop or construct standardized, sensitive, reproducible microarray
platforms, databases and visualization methods for expression profiles that are affordable to
most research scientists. With the use or development of improved, uniform and
sophisticated experimental designs, data management systems [126, 127], statistical tools
and upgraded algorithms for data analysis [128, 129], DNA microarrays hopefully can be
more optimally used in herbal drug research. In spite of the vast potential offered by
microarray and the related functional genomics and proteomics technology, the importance
of integrating various in vitro biological assays, cell culture-based and in vivo animal
experimental systems cannot be ignored. Comprehensive strategy integrating information
from diverse scientific experiments and technologies are expected to benefit and lead to
molecule and cell evidence-based phytomedicines.

306

Systems and Computational Biology – Molecular and Cellular Experimental Systems

The integration of information from genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics is hoped to
provide solid evidence-based rationales for systematic development of various modern
phytomedicines, on top of the foundations of various traditional medicine cultures. The
search for specific, active single phytocompound may also be expedited when various
metabolomics approaches are combined with a comprehensive array of bioactivity assay
systems using standardized and normalizable mammalian cell, tissue and animal models.
Wherea a “complete metabolome-exhibition” system is currently not available, HPLC-, GCand LC/MS-based metabolite-profiling systems, alone or in combination, may already offer
a good description or authentication tool for comparative and qualitative analyses and
definition of the unique, distinctive, or combinational profile features of the conventional
herbal medicine formulations, as elegantly demonstrated recently by W. Lam et al (2010)
[112]. These and the improved or newly developed metabolomics technologies in linkage
may also be usefully applied to discovery and development of new phytomedicines, as
single phyto-chemicals or their mixtures, or as fractions or the whole preparation of the
crude extracts of various medicinal plant tissues. Our challenges together, as scientists and
health care-takers are to coordinate and integrate our intellectual thrusts, talents and efforts
to address and target specific medical and medicinal research areas, e.g., for antiinflammation and related chronic or cancerous diseases, for future research and
development of advanced phytomedicines, may be to be pursued more effectively as an
international program.

High Content and Throughput Drug Discovery

1. Introduction
1.1 The marriage of ‘high throughput’ and ‘high content’.

While the pharmaceutical industry innovation crisis draws much debate (Kaitin & DiMasi,
2011; Macarron et al., 2011; Munos, 2009; Paul et al., 2010), there remains little consensus on
how to cohesively deliver value throughout the drug development pipeline (Fig. 1). This
chapter considers some of these issues in the context of a growing ﬁeld for computational
biology: drug discovery high throughput screening (HTS). HTS is the approach of rapidly
studying physical, chemical, biological and genetic perturbations on the scale of of tens of
thousands per day. Today we are faced with ultra-HTS daily screen rates of hundreds of
thousands, in part thanks to the continued development of technologies such as micro-ﬂuidics
(Agresti et al., 2010). As a discovery tool, it traces it roots back over twenty years (An &
Tolliday, 2010), however it is the more recent improvements in cell culture technique - with
the potential for multivariate output such as gene expression - that brings it into the domain of
high content computational biology. With this maturation of cell-based assays we also notice
an increased focus on statistical rigour, analytical integration, and the apparent user-driven
plateau in miniaturisation (Mayr & Bojanic, 2009). Rather than being faced with a continued
improvement in simple assay throughput, these suggest a growing role for more data-rich
high content HTS (hcHTS)1 .
Despite the implicit gains, there exists a notable and growing antipathy towards many ‘big
data’ approaches as discovery tools. Much publication has refocused on data quality versus
quantity, with some doubting the impact of high throughput science altogether (Douglas
et al., 2010; Macarron et al., 2011; Mayr & Bojanic, 2009). There persists the very real hurdle
of experimentalists and team leaders struggling with the interpretation, integration, and
decision making based on such data. As a concern routinely witnessed in post-genome era
science, it is doubtful that the blame rests primarily with problem-speciﬁc methodology. In
this chapter, the need for screens to be more decision-centric and transparent across disciplines
is proposed. The aim here is not just to provide the reader with speciﬁc tools that are likely to
rapidy become dated, but introduce the scope and opportunities in drug screening science.

In this chapter ‘high content’ is used interchangeably with ‘high dimension’, as applied to multiplexed
technologies that produce many descriptors per sample, well or observation. A common example is
gene expression microarrays. ‘High content screening’ is commonly used in the literature to indicate
high content imaging. To avoid confusion here, the high content approach to HTS is referred to as
hcHTS, and high content imaging is referred to as HCI.

Fig. 1. No single approach is prototypical of drug development. Particularly as a growing
number of therapeutic programmes focus on ‘biologics’ - such as proteins and RNA
inhibitors - versus ‘small molecule’ chemical therapies. However, in general it remains an
arduous, failure prone process of 10-15 years, costing hundreds of millions to billions of US$
(Adams & Brantner, 2006). The pipeline can be described as a task in managing attrition
rates; a process with a very low success rate sometimes beginning with many hundreds of
thousands of chemicals to launch a single successful therapy. The research and development
life of a potential drug might be considered in ﬁve phases. The ﬁrst being the identiﬁcation,
development and validation of a target for the drug; the most common targets being
G-protein coupled receptors and kinases. The second phase involves the discovery of ‘hit’
chemicals affecting the target, and development of the hits into leads. Hit through to lead
research often begins as high throughput assays, where large libraries of chemicals are
screened for effect and sometimes side-effect. What remains are the development phases of
animal (preclinical) and human (clinical) testing prior to market release and surveillance
(pharmacovigilance).

1.2 The vital role of computational biology.

hcHTS provides a unique challenge to the computational biologist more familiar with high
dimension analysis. It increases the analytical demand from the ‘few observations, many
descriptors’ paradigm of small sample multiplex genomics to that of ‘many observations,
many descriptors’. Drug discovery is also gradually devolving its chemo-centric dominance
into an increasingly bio-centric approach. This positions computational biology as a crucial
bridge between complex science and technology, and the challenging decisions that need
be made from the data produced. The melting pot of in vitro (cell-based and biochemical)
biology, cheminformatics, bioinformatics, systems biology, and ‘big data’ analysis requires
broad inter-disciplinary scientiﬁc and computational strengths. It affords the computational
biologist the opportunity to become part of a wide ranging science. A practice where
hypotheses and data iteratively reﬁne screens and studies, converging on greater scientiﬁc
understanding and deﬁned solutions.
This chapter is divided into two main parts. Section 2 contextualises some of the
challenges and considerations to guide the choice of modelling strategy, whilst section 3
provides a simple predictive toxicology example that builds on these suggestions. Two
traditionally medium throughput multiplex approaches - now increasingly being used in

higher throughput settings - will be discussed: gene expression and high content imaging
(Bickle, 2010; Zanella et al., 2010). For other promising hcHTS technologies, such as ﬂow
cytometry (Edwards et al., 2009) and label-free methods for real time living cell assessment
(Xie et al., 2009), the reader is referred to the provided citations. High content imaging (HCI)
utilises high resolution multiplex ﬂuorescence microscopy - typically immunoﬂuoresence - to
study cellular architecture and health (Karol Kozak, 2009; Zanella et al., 2010). Its strength as
a tool is the single cell resolution of physiologically relevant endpoints. HCI together with
transcriptomics might be thought of as high content cell and molecular phenotyping. While
gene expression analysis is not typically considered part of phenotypic assays, in the context
of hcHTS where perturbed pathways and their reporter genes are are studied as indicators of
biological process and cell state, it should very much be seen as a proxy of the cell’s molecular
phenotype. An example of where the two approaches have become inextricably linked is RNA
inhibition screens (Karol Kozak, 2009).

2. Modern high throughput drug discovery
2.1 ‘Big data’ analysis paralysis.

Not without its critics (Douglas et al., 2010), the ongoing drug discovery mantra has been
one of managing attrition rates by ‘failing early, failing often’. However, the biological and
drugability knowledge around validated targets has remained poor. An often cited FDA white
paper of the early post-genome years (FDA, 2004) drew widespread attention by calling for the
greater use of biomarkers and computational approaches to improve this knowledge. With the
strong political willpower to modernise drug discovery, HTS has continued to gain popularity
as a brute force innovation tool, entering the public domain with resources such as ChemBank
(http://chembank.broadinstitute.org), PubChem (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and
ChEMBL (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembldb).
Progress has however faced persistent
concerns, with common complaints being poor chemical library design (Gillet, 2008) and that
of decision-makers drowning in data. While chemical library design is beyond the scope of
this chapter, the data concern is one familiar to every high content computational biologist.
A contrasting argument to the suggested deluge of data as the core concern is that the
principal challenge lies with modelling strategy; not the data per se. A case in point might
be made of the much publicised Large Hadron Collider with its daily data quota exceeding 40
terabytes. This represents more data than that managed by a typical computational biology
team and - while still requiring considerable computing resources - remains a manageable
data ﬂow. This is arguably due to well developed theoretical models around which physics
expects the data to behave. In contrast, theoretical and systems biology still suffer from a
paucity of rigorous quantitative models relevant to disease and chemical biology. The ship
may be sinking not because the ocean is large, but because the water is bailed with teaspoons.
What then are the most appropriate strategies? To answer this we ﬁrst need to appreciate
that the challenge with screening science is less that of providing narrowly focused yes/no
answers. Rather it is more a task of iteratively triaging the optimal options, while managing
the decision-making risk across heterogeneous studies spanning months to years. Though
not a style of research unaccustomed to statisticians and decision analysts, this challenges
computational biology culture with its often data-centric rather than decision-centric and
translational mandates.

Fig. 2. A useful paradigm for HTS is that of the layers in a ‘modelling onion’, which
emphasises the crucial role of the computational biologist, bridging technology and scientiﬁc
decision making. Initial research is often driven by technology modelling: choosing the
optimal biological models, experimental protocols and technologies to provide good data
signal. Data modelling is the remit of computational biology, which might be divided up as a
spectrum of low level data clean-up through to higher level theoretical and systems
modelling. The screening computational biologist needs to balance the merits of providing
detailed results versus fast results; the latter proving useful if they enable the research team
to make real-time decisions and rapidly test hypotheses. In HTS this is often the balance of
primary versus secondary screening strategies. The ﬁnal, often neglected, layer is decision
modelling. No matter how well the HTS technologists and informaticians consider their
models to be performing, if these don’t explicitly and transparently assist large discovery
teams in making decisions, they are effectively of little use.
2.2 Improving your modelling IQ2

Modern biology retains its distinctive knowledge-driven culture as a science; differentiated
from more mature sciences as being heavily dependent on phenomenological ‘stamp
collecting’. Similar divides manifest in computational biology as low level data collection,
clean-up and mining of bioinformatics versus computational biology modelling. In research
with direct translational and economic goals - such as drug screening - it is helpful to
remember that:
• Science exists to create explanatory and/or predictive models.
Cohesive and
comprehensive modelling practice along the entire drug development pipeline is the
mandate of all researchers from in vitro to in silico to the patient.
• All models are wrong, some are useful. Particularly in HTS drug discovery, the
development and use of models should be driven by their utility as transparent, triaging
decision tools, not narrowly focused technological arguments.
• HTS combines three levels of modelling. Technology, data and decision models should be
seen as essential layers in a ‘modelling onion’ (Fig. 2).
There is, of course, no silver bullet to address data rich problems in drug screening.
Notwithstanding, there are general considerations before deciding on methods to optimise the
screening model (Fig. 3). A few overlapping rules of thumb are suggested here as a measure
of a screen’s IQ2 . The test for IQ2 summarises the need for better integration, assay quantitative

Fig. 3. The above immuno-stained cells - after timed exposure to a toxic chemical - provide a
simple example of the screening model in three parts: technology, data and decision
modelling. Here technology modelling involves the choice of an informative ﬂuorescent
biomarker in an appropriate cell model after an optimal perturbation duration. The data
model might be to infer the lowest concentration at which 10% of cells are statistically
signiﬁcantly brighter than twice the average baseline ﬂuorescence. This type of model is a
‘lowest dose with an effect’ model, where the combination of statistical and biological
signiﬁcance deﬁne the concentration output. The utility as a decision tool might be to
provide a reproducible relative measure of cytotoxicity across collaborating laboratories
interested in a simple ranking of cytotoxic effect, viz. a robust measure best suited as an
ordinal triage of effect. The aim being hazard identiﬁcation, with little explicit attention to
risk management and translational or economic impact.

performance, and the decision-making synergies (the squared exponent) which present with
the action-enabling results.
How well does your approach integrate? Integration entails more than just the use of all available
data, but includes the effective integration along the entire ﬂow of data through to knowledge
and scientiﬁc wisdom (Fig. 4). This is the central tenet of translational bioinformatics, which
aims to promote free ﬂow of data between the lab and patient (Buchan et al., 2011). Still in the
early stages, translational informatics projects such as Informatics for Integrating Biology and
the Bedside (http://www.i2b2.org) hold much promise for feeding back into HTS.
How quantitative is your approach? The quality of the inference is limited by the quantitative
performance of the screen. Too often it would seem that post hoc analysis attempts to stretch
the assertions made by screening models not ﬁt for purpose. In HTS the primary measures
of interest are dose and time. If, for example, a screening programme is required to predict
a new drug’s safety concerns (‘how toxic?’), these might be framed as one or more of many
dose and time relevant questions. A few translational toxicity concerns are listed below:
• The concentration at which a percentage of the population begin to experience an effect.
• The concentration at which the risk of rare (unpredictable) adverse effects becomes too
great.
• The extent of pathology after a set dose and time exposure.
• The optimal dosing schedule to minimise toxicity without signiﬁcant loss of efﬁcacy.
• Chronic affects - such as bioaccumulation - less easily extrapolated from acute and
sub-acute testing.

Fig. 4. The ﬂow of data into results and decisions reﬂects the well described ﬂow of
information into knowledge and wisdom. Bioinformatics began, in part, as a ﬁeld to address
data integration concerns (Searls, 2010). Today the integration of technologies, laboratories
and heterogeneous databases is common practice, and remains vibrant with emerging
resources such as cloud computing (Mak, 2011; Schadt et al., 2010). Less well practised is the
routine and formal integration of results beyond simple score-based meta-analyses. Bayesian
computation promises more formal approaches to update results and incorporate prior
information, yet advanced statistical treatment remains underutilised in modern HCS (Malo
et al., 2006). Again, the importance of assisting with decision making deserves greater
attention. Modelling approaches need be transparent enough to allow a diverse community
of scientists to easily communicate and understand the analytical assumptions and
limitations.

A role of the screening computational biologist should be seen as providing reliable
quantitative measures of concentration and time to hypotheses/questions; not just the
provision of IC50 or EC50 values per variable. The concern, for example, is not the reliable
measure of gene expression and the conﬁdence around these measures per se. Rather, it’s the
transformation of these values into measures of concentration and time, and the conﬁdence
around these measures.
Three quantitative concerns often deserving better consideration are suggested:
3(σ̂ +σ̂ )

• The ﬁrst is the signal-to-noise ratio (Fig. 5A), commonly measured as Z = 1 − |μ̂ p−μ̂ n| , for
p
n
positive and negative controls p and n respectively. A Z-score greater than 0.5 is typically
accepted to suggest a good assay. The Z-score is a narrowly focused measurement aimed
at single-plex assays, which is not robust and assumes data normality. It also does not take
into account the performance impact on decision making.
• A second concern is dynamic range. Not all cell models or technologies provide an
adequate dynamic range in which drug effects over wide concentration ranges can reliably
be measured by a broad spectrum of markers exhibiting near-linear correlation with the
effects they proxy. A well known example of this is the poor dynamic performance
of gene expression microarrays demonstrated by the Microarray Quality Control project
(MAQC Consortium et al., 2006). The screening computational biologist needs to clearly
demonstrate the adequate dynamic performance of their data prior to establishing any
routine screening.
• The third and ﬁnal consideration can be broadly deﬁned as that of information
resolution. Screens and their follow-up secondary screens/studies need to deﬁne clear
goals of improving concentration and time sampling density to ensure accurate and
sufﬁciently precise quantitative assertions. The results also need to be presented to
the decision-making team at an optimal resolution to be informative without being
overwhelming (Fig. 5B - 5D).

Fig. 5. (A) quantitative PCR measurement of gene expression remains the most common gold
standard for assessing gene expression without the dynamic limitations of nucleic acid
hybridisation technologies, such as gene expression microarrays. However, as can be seen in
this well controlled example of highly replicated measurements for a single gene across
several compounds, achieving repeated in vitro measurement within 1 CT unit remains a
challenge. Assuming near optimal reaction efﬁciency, the CT scale approaches log2 ,
indicating the cost and time challenge of adequate replication to conﬁdently discern the
doubling of a gene’s expression under screening conditions. (B-D) The resolution at which it
is optimal to present results affects the design and/or execution of the data modelling.
Figure B provides a detailed trace of ﬁve genes perturbed by a compound in a secondary
screen. While being detailed, it is ineffective at answering ‘at what dose?’ and quickly
becomes intractable in terms of technical cost and analysis when comparing multiple
compounds. Figure C partly resolves this by presenting the results as bars beginning at the
lowest concentration at which the answer to the question becomes true. Figure D presents
this information for the same genes, comparing tested compounds, numerically providing
the concentrations and displaying the statistical conﬁdence in the results as being
proportional to the bubble size. Here we see that drug B behaves most similarly to drug A,
but at a 5-fold higher concentration (lower potency). It would seem from the screen that we
can be fairly conﬁdent that drug C behaves differently from drugs A and B.

Fig. 6. Careful consideration need always be given to the actionability of screening methods
used. If, for example, compound A clusters (or classiﬁes) together with a prototypical
compound in cluster A, while compound B clusters together with another prototype in
cluster B, does this provide sufﬁcient information to prioritise compound A with a deﬁned
dose and time dependent conﬁdence? Similarly with pathway-driven approaches. If
compound A does not up-regulate genes H and J at low concentrations, how does this
translate into dose and time dependent effects for the purposes of screen prioritisation?

How actionable is your approach? The most important consideration is how effective the
screening strategy is at enabling the team to make informed decisions that lead to clear actions
where the utility, cost and risk attached to those actions are understood. These can again be
considered at the technology, data and decision modelling levels.
Technologist bias will routinely be towards increasing technology complexity within time and
cost restraints. However, increased complexity needs to translate into improved actionability.
The debate on simple cell culture techniques replaced by the earlier use of lower throughput
three-dimensional approaches (Fernandes et al., 2009) highlights this concern. Complex in
vitro approaches run the risk of compromised data reproducibility. If reduced reproducibility
and cost of technology complexity outweigh potential gains in insight, the technological
improvements and necessary data modelling changes need be questioned.
The over-reliance on exploratory bioinformatics without clear quantitative questions,
hypotheses and follow up is arguably core to current innovation failures (Fig. 6). Three pillars
of result signiﬁcance enable the rational implementation of screens:
• The ﬁrst is statistical signiﬁcance, which has traditionally played a minor role within
single-plex HCS (Karol Kozak, 2009; Malo et al., 2006).
• Not to be confused with statistical signiﬁcance is biological signiﬁcance. A differentially
expressed gene deﬁned purely in terms of statistical conﬁdence above baseline needn’t
represent its biological relevance as a useful marker to elucidate mechanism or enable clear
actions based on screening questions.
• The economic argument forms the ﬁnal pillar, where cost is considered together with utility
(Swamidass et al., 2010).
Bayesian methods provide a useful framework to formally work with these different notions
of importance, whilst also enabling the use of external data - such as cheminformatics and

Fig. 7. Common cheminformatics practice is to deﬁne descriptors of structure and
physiochemical properties in order to position a compound in chemical space. If the purpose
of bioinformatics is not only to deﬁne molecular and cellular phenotype patterns and
mechanisms, then the role of the screening computational biologist effectively becomes a
collaborative counterpart to the cheminformatician, deﬁning biological descriptors that are
not merely useful as biologically predictive or mechanistic markers, but can be mapped to
chemical descriptors in order to deﬁne structure-activity relationships (SAR) for rational
drug design.

pharmacoeconomics - to establish meaningful priors. However Bayesian analysis appears
notably absent in routine published practice (Klon, 2009; Nidhi et al., 2006). Computational
limitations seem less likely than the poor understanding surrounding the use of these
methods. The need for model understanding and transparency by the entire decision making
team is paramount. So until formal frameworks can meet this need, we are left to rely on
simpler approaches, some of which are discussed later in this chapter.
Finally, it might be argued that screening methods should ultimately strive not to provide
a ‘post-mortem’ of results but actively assist the discovery team to design better therapies.
If, for example, a screen has been developed to predict a spectrum of toxicities from tested
chemicals, it should not only accurately identify the correct toxicities, but also their dose-time
properties while guiding the chemists on how to alter the compound structures to improve
their safety proﬁles. This re-emphasises the argument for generalist computational biologists
in HTS who are able to collaborate with the chemical design and cheminformatics teams,
identifying actionable structure-activity relationships (Fig. 7).

3. ‘Next generation’ drug screening
The title above has deliberately been borrowed from the same description applied to second
generation nucleic acid sequencing technologies. It is used in part to stress the increasingly
high content ﬂavour of HCS, but also the need for a new screening paradigm focused on
a cohesive, transparent and actionable modelling practice. Drawing from real data, this

approach to create screens not only with good performance characteristics but which can be
easily understood and acted on by all team members.
3.1 Rules, weights and thresholds

Cheminformatics has routinely utilised machine-driven pattern recognition to distil large data
sets into rule-based models as a form of ‘human readable’ modelling, or rules of thumb, to
predict drug properties. A well known example applicable to ADME is Lipinski’s Rule of
Five, which assesses how likely it is that a chemical will be orally active. To pass Lipinski’s
rule, a chemical is limited to violating no more than one criterion:
• Less than or equal to ﬁve hydrogen bond donors.
• Less than or equal to ten hydrogen bond acceptors.
• Less than or equal to 500 daltons in molecular weight.
• An octanol-water partition coefﬁcient log P less than or equal to 5
In a similar vein, standard bioinformatics methods can be distilled into combinations of
rules, creating such models. These can be tested, reﬁned and understood by non-specialists
across the drug discovery team (Fig. 8), with biological and decision-relevant signiﬁcance
better ensured by applying transparent weights and thresholds (Fig. 9). As a consequence
of increased computing power and data set size, it seems likely that rule-based approaches
will grow in popularity as a tractable modelling strategy. Rule-based modelling has already
proven popular in systems biology, where unmanageable lists of differential equations have
yielded to agent-based rules of interaction used to drive simulations (Barnes, 2010; Krakauer
et al., 2011; Yoav Shoham, 2009). As a methodological approach, rule-based modelling
provides a natural bridge for team-driven hypothesis generation and the maturation of
generalities for mechanistic and screening biology treated as information science. A particular
beneﬁt of rule-based models in screening is that it also allows for the seamless integration of
multiple data types. A model might be a collection of rules from multiple cell culture models,
multiple time scales, and multiple technologies such as quantitative PCR, HCI, and classical
cytometry. Collectively, all of these beneﬁts ensure a high IQ2 for rule-based models.
3.2 Screening with HT-StreamTM

In vitro drug safety screening currently falls within the domain of what are typically
medium throughput models aimed at predicting drug absorption, distribution, metabolism
and excretion (Ekins et al., 2005). These models are collectively referred to as predictive
ADME. Combinatorial chemistry and the shift of ADME to early stage discovery have both
signiﬁcantly improved our ability to design efﬁcacious pharmaceuticals. This has left drug
toxicity as an important bottleneck contributing to the innovation crisis, and has prompted its
shift to earlier ‘off target’ cell screens. Whilst born out of lower throughput toxicogenomics
(Van Hummelen & Sasaki, 2010), this shift of high content application to high throughput
screening requires new methodology and software.
Fig. 10 provides an example of two established DNA damage and stress markers tested
on the hepaRG® human liver cell co-culture (Guguen-Guillouzo & Guillouzo, 2010) using
quantitative PCR. Microﬂuidic ‘lab-on-a-chip’ improvements have enabled cost-effective,
high throughput quantitative PCR (Stedtfeld et al., 2008); dramatically improving the
scalability of this gold-standard technology as a stand-alone tool or in conjunction with

Fig. 8. The apoptosis pathway, as represented above, is commonly used to predict drug
safety concerns. A typical bioinformatics approach in a high dimension setting might be to
search for apoptosis gene enrichment. Gene set enrichment based on established pathways
or ontologies is a rough exploratory tool that translates poorly into a setting where a precise
dose-response relationship is required. Using unguided machine learning, literature mining
and expert knowledge, complex pathways can be stripped down to collections of rules able
to be reﬁned over time and combined to form rule-based models. An example of a rule-based
model might be ‘clinically signiﬁcant human apoptosis when at least one, but no greater than
four of the following gene ratios hold true. . . ’. In a dose-response setting, the lowest
concentration at which the rule holds true is called, as a ‘lowest dose with an effect’ model.

other high content methods such as HCI. While it remains traditional to begin testing gene
expression at cell cytotoxicity IC50 concentrations, these do not represent physiologically
appropriate dosings. As suggested in the data correlations of Fig. 11, HCI allows for
mechanistically relevant concentrations to reﬁne classic viability assays in the absence of
reliable human data; and discover transcriptomic biomarkers for use in rule-based models.
Once the models have been developed,
HT-StreamTM (www.ht-stream.com,
www.simugen-global.com) proves useful as online collaborative software that presents
the results in a decision-focused manner (Fig. 12). All submitted screening data undergoes
automated quality control (Fig. 10A), prior to the inference of the lowest concentration
at which each rule becomes true. HT-StreamTM uses the derived concentrations, together
with weights and thresholds to help prioritise compounds, visualise results, and compare
models (Fig. 13). Easy-to-use software such as this helps make it possible for teams to create
‘ecosystems’ of applications, rules and models; continuously reﬁning them as collective
interdisciplinary knowledge grows with transparent, decision-centric screens.

Fig. 9. The above plots represents the output for two ‘lowest dose with an effect’ models for
ﬁve tested compounds. The aim here is to rank compounds from highest to lowest toxicity,
viz. prioritise those presenting with toxicity at lower concentrations. The darker a
compound’s label, the higher it is prioritised. The x-axes represent increasing microMolar
concentrations of the compounds, with bars representing 95% conﬁdence intervals. (A) Here
we observe the simplest prioritisation: drug A demonstrates high potency (from model A)
and so is ranked ﬁrst. The beneﬁt of presenting data as concentration values, and the
statistical conﬁdence around those values, is evident. While drug A is prioritised over drug
B, their conﬁdence intervals overlap, suggesting insufﬁcient statistical evidence to support
the ranking. (B) The same results are plotted, but with a threshold added to drug B. In this
example, drug B has prior information regarding its therapeutic efﬁcacy. The discovery team
have decided that any toxicity called above a certain threshold will be of little consequence,
as it is unlikely to be reached at therapeutic concentrations. By including this threshold, drug
B is de-prioritised. (C) The previous rankings assume an equal weighting of the two models.
In reality this is rarely the case. If model A represents the drug’s carcinogenic potential,
whilst model B represents a low-grade safety concern, then model A requires a greater
weighting in the global prioritisation. Here drugs D and E switch positions as model B is
assigned a low weighting. Thresholds and weights ensure transparent assumptions of
biological relevance. With the inclusion of prototypical compounds in the test rankings,
transparent weights, thresholds, and statistical signiﬁcance enable the team to collectively
make informed, defensible decisions.

The x-axis represents increasing compound concentration, while each tick in the y-axis
represents a CT unit; a drop in one unit thus representing a doubling in gene expression. The
analysis tools provide robust automated quality control, in this case identifying two
measurements believed to be outliers in bold. (B) SimuGen’s biomarker discovery tools
provide a reference database for over 22,000 genes tested across multiple chemical
perturbations in hepaRG® . The above result for GADD45A has identiﬁed its most strongly
correlated toxic biomarkers, and plotted their ﬁrst two principal components. GADD45A is
highlighted with an arrow and can be seen to be closely clustered with, and enriching for,
known genotoxic biomarkers.

Fig. 11. HCI allows the standardisation of compound concentrations using mechanistic
criteria. This correlation plot demonstrates strong correlation (dark squares: Pearson >0.8)
and anti-correlation (light squares: Pearson<-08) between known hepatotoxic biomarkers
and microscopic phenotypes. The gene expression proﬁle for each compound is measured at
the lowest concentration at which any HCI phenotype emerges. Considering drop in
mitochondrial mass and potential as a joint phenotype (highlighted) shows strong
association with with stress, metabolic and cirrhosis markers. Strong correlations such as
these indicate the compatibility of the approaches and the ability to used joint HCI and gene
expression data in rule-based models.

Fig. 12. The right-hand side plot traces the paths of GADD45A and CDKN1A over almost 50
chemicals as their concentrations increase. The black paths represent known genotoxic
drugs. It can be seen that there is a ‘golden ratio’ for the two genes between the dotted lines.
Most compounds fall below, whilst non-genotoxic compounds typically present above.
HT-StreamTM allows such rules to be entered.

Fig. 13. Using the weights and thresholds, all tested compounds are ranked in HT-StreamTM .
Any model with a positive result has its results plotted, and contrasted to similar behaving
compounds, as described in Fig. 9. A principal components plot, using all models, is also
provided to allow the computational biologist and chemist to identify overall patterns that
might be related back to chemical structure.
