About the Special Issue Editors
Tipu Z. Aziz, Ph. D., is the founder and head of Oxford functional neurosurgery. His primate work
was central to confirming the subthalamic nucleus as a possible surgical target for deep brain
stimulation in Parkinson’s disease and more recently the pedunculopontine nucleus. OFN is currently
one of the busiest centres for such surgery in the UK and academically very productive.
Research Interests are the role of the upper brain stem in the control of movement, the clinical
neurophysiology of movement disorders and neuropathic pain and autonomic responses to deep brain
stimulation, use of MR and MEG imaging in functional neurosurgery.
Alexander L. Green, Ph.D., has been looking at the neurocircuitry underlying autonomic function and
pain in humans undergoing Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) over the past ten years. There are several
aims of this research. Firstly, he wishes to understand both the mechanisms underlying the
pathophysiology of neuropathic pain as well as why some patients get much better than results than
others. Secondly, by understanding the autonomic nervous system, it may be possible to control
diseases such as hypertension, respiratory and bladder disease by brain manipulation in the future.
Most of the research to date has involved stimulating brain areas under different experimental
conditions and also recording local field potentials to understand the underlying neurophysiology.
This work has resulted in a number of publications including improvement in peak expiratory flow
with stimulation, the effect of stimulation on blood pressure and baroreceptors sensitivity and novel
electrical signals associated with pain states.

Preface to “Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)
Application”
This special issue looks at some of the developments taking place in the field of brain stimulation,
with a particular emphasis on deep brain stimulation. The broad nature of the manuscripts reflects the
ever broadening nature of the field of Brain Stimulation. The papers in this issue reflect cutting edge
research and clinical practice and range from preliminary concept to clinical trials i.e., work that is already
being translated. The reader will see that the field of DBS which was very focused on movement disorders
for a thirty year period until around 2000–2005 now includes treatment of obesity, Huntington’s disease,
Tourette’s syndrome and there are explorations into other realms such as spinal cord injury and
schizophrenia. Fast improving technology and developments in other areas of Neuroscience is being
applied to DBS to make it better and to expand the indications. Whilst the early applications of DBS
involved psychiatric disorders and pain, these indications are now being revisited. We hope that this
collection of articles will be both informative and inspiring to the reader, who will, in turn, contribute to
the ever increasing knowledge and development of this technique.

Abstract: We present our experience at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) in deep brain
stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN), describing our surgical technique, and reporting
our clinical results, and morbidities. Twenty patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease (PD) who
underwent bilateral STN-DBS were studied. Patients were assessed preoperatively and followed
up for one year using the Uniﬁed Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) in “on” and “off”
medication and “on” and “off” stimulation conditions. At one-year follow-up, we calculated
signiﬁcant improvement in all the motor aspects of PD (UPDRS III) and in activities of daily
living (UPDRS II) in the “off” medication state. The “off” medication UPDRS improved by 49.3%,
tremors improved by 81.6%, rigidity improved by 50.0%, and bradykinesia improved by 39.3%.
The “off” medication UPDRS II scores improved by 73.8%. The Levodopa equivalent daily dose was
reduced by 54.1%. The UPDRS IVa score (dyskinesia) was reduced by 65.1%. The UPDRS IVb score
(motor ﬂuctuation) was reduced by 48.6%. Deep brain stimulation of the STN improves the cardinal
motor manifestations of the idiopathic PD. It also improves activities of daily living, and reduces
medication-induced complications.

1. Introduction
The deep brain stimulation (DBS) system consists of a lead that is implanted into a speciﬁc deep
brain target. The lead is connected to an implantable pulse generator (IPG), which is the power source
of the system. The lead and the IPG are connected by an extension wire that is tunneled under the skin
between both of them. This system is used to chronically stimulate the deep brain target by delivering
a high-frequency current to this target [1,2].
James Parkinson was the ﬁrst to describe Parkinson’s disease (PD) in 1817; he described it as
a combination of tremor, rigidity, postural abnormalities, and bradykinesia [3]. The main step that
marked the onset of stereotactic surgery and the surgical treatment of different movement disorders
was in 1947, when Ernest Spiegel and Henry Wycis invented the ﬁrst frame-based stereotactic apparatus
Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 58

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 58

“stereoencephalotome”. This was the ﬁrst device to be used for localization of targets in the living
human brain [4]. They performed the ﬁrst stereotactic thalamotomy and pallidotomy, but the clinical
effects were disappointing [5,6].
The credit goes to Leksell for using the posteroventral pallidum as the target for lesioning [7].
At the same time, the ventrolateral (VL) nucleus of the thalamus emerged as a target for lesioning,
and with time it replaced pallidotomy for the treatment of tremors [8–10].
The discovery of Levodopa in the late 1960s led to a decline in surgeries for PD. Lesioning of the
ventral intermediate (Vim) nucleus of the thalamus and the globus pallidus internus (GPi) continued
to be the major surgical targets.
The ﬁrst published work describing the use of DBS in the treatment of PD was by Benabid et al.
in Montreal, France in 1987. They proved that high-frequency DBS was able to mimic, in a reversible
and adjustable manner, the effects of ablation of Vim as the target to control tremors [11–13]. The ﬁrst
attempt to use the GPi as the target of DBS to treat PD was by Siegfried and Lippitz, published
in 1994. DBS of the GPI proved efﬁciency in controlling tremors, bradykinesia, and drug-induced
dyskinesias [14–16]. The subthalamic nucleus (STN) was investigated in animal studies as a target for
Parkinson’s disease surgery [17]. Lesioning of the STN in humans proved to be effective in reducing
the three cardinal symptoms of PD [18,19]. Again, Benabid and the Grenoble group were the pioneers
in using DBS of the STN for the treatment of PD in 1994, based on ﬁndings from animal studies [20,21].
This led to the approval of DBS by the FDA as a method of treatment of PD. Since then the STN
has been the target of choice for DBS in PD patients. It proved to be superior to medical therapy in
controlling tremors, rigidity, and dyskinesia in advanced stages of PD [22–26].
Shakal et al. reported the ﬁrst use of STN-DBS for the management of PD in Egypt in 2011 [27].
At the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), USA, DBS surgeries started with the work of the senior
author (KVS) in early 2001. The work we are presenting here is a collaborative work between the
Neurosurgery Department of Alexandria, Egypt and that of UIC. Here we present the STN-DBS
experience at UIC, describe our surgical technique, and report our clinical results and morbidities.
Our objectives are to evaluate the clinical outcome of STN-DBS in PD and share our experience in
this ﬁeld.
2. Methods
After obtaining an appropriate IRB approval, we retrospectively analyzed the data of 20 patients
diagnosed with advanced PD who underwent bilateral STN-DBS at the UIC in the period from 2013
to 2014. Patients who qualiﬁed for surgery had idiopathic PD and showed sustained response to
levodopa, with a minimum of 30% improvement in Uniﬁed Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)
motor subscore following a levodopa challenge. Most patients had severe levodopa-related motor
response despite optimal dose adjustment, and/or disabling tremors. We excluded patients with
atypical Parkinsonism as multiple system atrophy (MSA), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP),
corticobasal degeneration, vascular, and drug-induced parkinsonism. We also excluded patients with
severe cognitive impairment or dementia (Mattis Dementia Rating Scale <130 or Mini Mental Status
examination ≤24), patients with severe uncontrolled psychiatric illness or depression (Beck Depression
Inventory II score >19), and patients with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of moderate
to severe cortical atrophy, ventricular enlargement, and signiﬁcant white matter changes or other
signiﬁcant intracranial lesions such as tumor, arteriovenous malformations, etc. We also excluded
patients with other signiﬁcant illnesses.
2.1. Pre-Operative Patient Assessment and Selection
The ﬁrst step of the patient assessment was to conﬁrm the diagnosis of primary PD and exclude
other forms of movement disorders and atypical forms of parkinsonism. To make the diagnosis,
the patient must have at least two of the three motor features (rest tremors, bradykinesia, and rigidity),
and bradykinesia must be one of those two features. The patient must have a good response to

4

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 58

dopaminergic drugs, as poor response suggests an atypical parkinsonian syndrome. We only included
patients who had the disease for more than ﬁve years; this is to follow the recommendation of the core
assessment program for surgical interventional therapies in PD (CAPSIT-PD) committee [28–31].
Each patient was asked to come for a second appointment after being off medications for 12 h to
be evaluated for surgery. At this visit, the patient was assessed for mental state, behavior, and mood
(part I of the UPDRS) [32–35]. Then the patient was assessed for activities of daily living (ADL),
using part II of the UPDRS in both the “on” and “off” states. Then the patient was evaluated for
levodopa-related complications using the UPDRS part IV [33,34,36], including the duration of motor
ﬂuctuation (items 36–39) and the severity of levodopa-induced dyskinesia (items 32–35). In the early
phase of PD, symptoms can be controlled with dopaminergic medications [37,38]. After ﬁve or more
years of dopaminergic therapy, about 50% of patients begin to experience motor ﬂuctuations and
dyskinesia and may become candidates for DBS [37,38]. In the late phase of PD, some patients become
unresponsive to levodopa. Those patients are not considered surgical candidates for DBS [37,38].
Then the patient was assessed using the levodopa challenge test and the UPDRS motor scoring
(part III) and video recorded. First, the scale was performed in an “off” state. Then the patient was
given a supra-therapeutic dose of levodopa (1.5 times the patient’s current dose) and the UPDRS motor
scale was assessed again during the “best on state”. At this visit, we also calculated the axial score by
summing the motor subscores: speech, gait, posture, and postural stability (items 18, 28, 29, and 30 of
the UPDRS part III). We also assessed the Modiﬁed Hoehn and Yahr Rating Scale (HYRS) [39], and the
Schwab and England Rating Scale (SERS) [40]. Both of them were done in the “off” state. We also
calculated the levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) [41].
2.2. Neuropsychological and Psychiatric Evaluation
A dedicated psychologist then assessed the patient during the best “on” state.
The tests used for assessment were: Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS) [42], Beck Depression
Inventory II (BDI-II) [43,44], Independent Living Scale (ILS)—Health and Safety, Mini Mental Status
Exam (MMSE) [45,46], Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test—Fourth Edition (PPVT-4), Wechsler Adult
Intelligence Scale for DSM-IV (WAIS-IV)—Digit Span, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST),
Hopkins’ Verbal Learning Test—Revised (HVLT-R), and Frontal System Behavior Scale (FrSBe).
This assessment is a mandatory step before surgery. It helps to exclude any patient with severe
cognitive and or behavioral impairments (Mattis Dementia Rating Scale <130 or Mini Mental Status
examination ≤24), severe uncontrolled psychiatric illness or depression (Beck Depression Inventory II
score >19). This assessment also helped to establish the baseline of the mental, verbal, and frontal lobe
functions for further follow-up.
2.3. Surgery
The surgery was done in two stages. In the ﬁrst stage, we implanted DBS electrodes under
local anesthesia using the frame-based stereotactic technique. The patient was instructed to stop
all anti-Parkinsonian medications 12 h before surgery to facilitate microelectrode recording (MER),
and allow clinical assessment during stimulation. The ﬁrst step was the application of the Leksell
frame Model G (Elekta Instruments, Inc., Atlanta, GA, USA) to the patient’s head (Figure 1).
A high-resolution MRI of the patient’s brain with 3-tesla scanner (Signa 3T94 VHi; General Electric
Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI, USA) was done. Two main sequences were obtained. The ﬁrst is a
3D T1-weighted, spoiled gradient echo imaging of the entire head (section thickness: 2 mm; ﬁeld of
view: 26 × 26 cm; TR: 7.0–8.0 ms; TE: ~400 ms; ﬂip angle: 12; band width: 31.25 KHz; acquisition time:
<7 min). The second sequence is high-resolution, contiguous, T2-weighted, fast spin-echo imaging
through the region of the midbrain and basal ganglia (section thickness: 1.5 mm; slice interval: 0 mm;
matrix size: 512 × 512; ﬁeld of view: 26 × 26 cm; TR: 4600–6200 ms; TE: 95–108 ms; acquisition time:
<5 min) (Figure 2).

nuclei (STN).

At the end of the scan, we chose an axial T2 image (or two adjacent images) in which both the
AC and the PC are seen (Figure 3). With simple arithmetic equations based on the Leksell frame
coordinates system, we were able to calculate the stereotactic coordinates of the mid-commissural
point (MCP), and the STN directly from the MRI coordinates of the AC and the PC (Figure 4). Based on
the known anatomical relationship of the STN to MCP from the previous anatomical studies and
stereotactic atlases [36,47–54], we selected the STN target at 12 mm lateral, 3 mm posterior, and 6 mm
inferior to the MCP.

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 58

The second method we used to calculate the STN coordinates was direct visualization of the STN
on a T2 weighted MRI (Figure 5) [55]. The STN is the almond-shaped hypointense structure located
lateral and anterior to the red nucleus. We identiﬁed an axial T2 image that showed the largest red
nuclei circumference, and then we drew a line from the midline, medial to lateral, along the anterior
edge of RN. The center of the STN was chosen at the extension of this straight line about 12 mm from
the midline. Then the coordinates were calculated using the same Excel worksheet. Another method
of the STN coordinates localization was done in the OR, using the FrameLink software, which is a part
of the StealthStation navigation system (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) (Figure 6). The software
compensates for head and frame tilt in any direction. It allows calculation of the STN coordinates
and planning of suitable entry point and trajectory of the DBS electrode that avoid going through the
cortical sulci, the ventricles, or any cerebral blood vessels. The ﬁnal coordinates for the procedure were
derived from all the previous techniques and subsequently adjusted using intraoperative electrical
microrecording and macrostimulation.
In the operating room, the patient was placed on the operating table with a Leksell frame
secured to the table using a Mayﬁeld adapter. The C-arm was placed around the patient in order to use
intraoperative ﬂuoroscopy for electrode tracking and positioning (Figure 7). We used transparent sterile
drapes to allow easier communication with the patient and observation of the patient’s symptoms
during this awake procedure (Figure 8). Two semicircular incisions were made on both sides of the
midline (Figure 9). Then we drilled two burr holes, one on each side, 1 cm anterior to the coronal
suture and 2–3 cm lateral to the midline. We started the surgeries with the left side and then shifted to
the right side.
We performed microelectrode recording (MER) of the brain activity using a NeuroNav microelectrode
recording system (AlphaOmega, Nazareth, Israel) (Figure 10). Fluoroscopic confirmation of the target
approach was obtained at 5 mm intervals, 2 mm above the target, and at the target (Figure 11).

After identiﬁcation of the STN borders and depth by the MER, we started high-frequency
macrostimulation. The aim of the stimulation was to conﬁrm the optimal target, which provided
adequate control of the Parkinsonian symptoms (speciﬁcally tremors), without undesirable effects
from stimulation below 4 volts. Once we reached our desired target, we removed the microelectrode
and replaced it with a standard four-contact (0–3) deep brain stimulation electrode (Medtronic DBS
lead 3389). Generally, we placed the deepest electrode contact (0) at or just beyond the target point.
We repeated the testing using this electrode in order to conﬁrm the reproducibility of the effects.
We locked the electrode in place using a Stimloc device (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) (Figure 12).
The excess of the electrode was coiled around the burr hole to create a strain relief loop (Figure 13).
Then the same procedure was repeated on the right side.
The patient returned to hospital after one week for the second-stage surgery, in which the IPG
was implanted in the sub-clavicular region under general anesthesia. After surgery, the IPG was
interrogated. We checked the impedance of all eight contacts and programmed the pulse width,
frequency, and amplitude of stimulation. By the end of the programming, we conﬁrmed that the
amplitude was set at zero and that the voltage of the battery was in the expected range.

2.4. Post-Operative Patient Assessment
Immediately after the ﬁrst stage of surgery, all patients had a CT scan of the head to rule out
hemorrhage. All of them had an MRI of the brain on the same day of surgery or the next day before
discharge to conﬁrm accurate electrode placement.
An experienced neurologist performed the ﬁrst postoperative programming session one month
after surgery. This interval was given to allow the brain to recover from the surgery and the
micro-lesioning effect of the electrode placement. The patient was programmed to the best setting that
gave the best clinical improvement at the lowest stimulation intensity and largest therapeutic range
before inducing undesirable effects. At the same time, drug doses were reduced.
Comprehensive neurological evaluation was done 12 months after surgery. At this visit, each
patient came after 12 h without medical treatment. The patient was reassessed for parts I, II, and IV
of the UPDRS. After this, each patient was assessed using the UPDRS III and video recorded in four
conditions: “on” stimulation and “off” medication; then “off” stimulation and “off” medication, after
switching off the stimulation for at least 1 hour; then “off” stimulation and “on” medication, after
administration of a supra-threshold dose of levodopa and waiting for the “best on state”; then “on”
stimulation and “on” medication, after turning on stimulation using the chronic stimulation parameters.
We also calculated the axial score, MMSE and SERS [40]. We recalculated the LEDD for the patient’s
recent anti-Parkinsonism medications. We documented any surgical-, device-, or stimulation-related
undesirable effects.
2.5. Data Collection and Statistical Analysis
The collected data were coded, tabulated, and statistically analyzed using the IBM SPSS statistics
software version 22.0 (IBM Corp., Chicago, IL, 2013). Descriptive statistics were done for quantitative
data as minimum & maximum of the range, median and ﬁrst & third inter-quartile range, as well
as mean ± SD (standard deviation). We calculated the number and percentages for qualitative data.
Inferential analyses were done for quantitative variables using the two-tailed paired t-test for two
dependent groups with parametric data, and the Wilcoxon signed rank test for two dependent groups
with non-parametric data. Correlations were calculated using the two-tailed Pearson correlation for
numerical parametric data, the two-tailed Spearman’s rho test for numerical non-parametric and
qualitative data, and the two-tailed partial correlation when controlling for a HYRS. The level of
signiﬁcance was taken at p value <0.05.
3. Results
Twenty patients were included in this study; six were men (30%), and 14 were women (70%).
The age of the patients at the time of surgery ranged from 48 to 82 years, with a mean age of 61.1 years.
12

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 58

The duration of illness before surgery ranged from ﬁve to 30 years, with a mean duration of 11.7 years.
The mean ± SD of HYRS of PD stage was 3.6 ± 0.7 with a range from 2.5 to 5.0. No correlation was
found between age, sex, family history, or the preoperative associated medical conditions and the
one-year follow-up results (Table 1).
The total surgical time of the ﬁrst-stage surgery ranged from 133 to 280 min, with a mean ± SD
of 214.8 ± 44.3 min. The average number of MER tracks used for mapping the STN at a single side
was 1.4.

We did not ﬁnd a correlation between the preoperative improvement in the UPDRS III score,
bradykinesia, and axial score after levodopa intake and the one-year follow-up values. A positive
correlation was found between the preoperative improvement in tremors score (r = 0.563, p = 0.010)
and rigidity score (r = 0.485, p = 0.030) with the postoperative tremors and rigidity, respectively.
Regarding the “on” medication state, a total improvement by mean ± SD of 7.0 ± 9.7 (36.5%)
from the preoperative “on” medication motor subscore to the one-year follow-up “on” medication
“on” stimulation score (p < 0.001). Tremors improved by mean ± SD of 2.5 ± 3.8 (78.1%) with
p = 0.002. Rigidity improved by mean ± SD of 1.6 ± 1.6 (61.5%) with p < 0.001. Bradykinesia improved
by mean ± SD of 2.7 ± 3.9 (31.4%) with p = 0.002. The axial score improved by mean ± SD of
0.3 ± 1.4 (10.7%) with p = 0.046 (Table 3).
The “off” medication “off” stimulation score at one year decreased by a mean of 0.4 (1%) compared
to the preoperative “off” medication score. This change was found to be non-signiﬁcant (p = 0.452).
The “on” medication “off” stimulation at one year increased compared to the preoperative “on” score
by a mean of 1.6 (8.3%) with p = 0.13.

3.5. Complications
All patients reported a postoperative headache that was relieved within a few days. This headache
may be attributed to the surgical intervention itself or to the small ﬁlm of pneumocephalus that
appeared on the postoperative CT scans of all the patients. This pneumocephalus was transient and
disappeared within days on follow-up CT scans. Three patients complained of memory difﬁculties;
one patient experienced a worsening of his daytime hallucinations, one patient experienced numbness
of the scalp at the incision site, and one patient experienced an increase in his depressive symptoms.
These adverse events were transient and disappeared within a few weeks. One patient suffered a
worsening of speech when turning the stimulation on. One patient developed postoperative right
frontal hemorrhage at the site of the cortical penetration by the electrode, and she suffered deterioration
of the level of consciousness. The hematoma was evacuated and she achieved complete recovery
within one month. One patient suffered from wound dehiscence at the IPG implantation site. The IPG
was removed and replaced with a new one in a subcutaneous pocket in the anterior abdominal wall.
4. Discussion
In this study we present a snapshot of our experience at UIC in the management of advanced PD
using STN-DBS by reporting our preoperative and intraoperative methods as well as the clinical
outcomes of 20 patients who were operated on from 2013 to 2014 and followed up for a year.
Our experience with DBS started in 2001, and over the years we have modiﬁed and improved our
techniques [55–57].

16

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 58

We have done our preoperative target calculations using a combination of the standard indirect
atlas-based X, Y, and Z coordinates of the STN at 12 mm lateral, 3 mm posterior, and 6 mm inferior to
the MCP, and direct visualization of the STN on T2 weighted images.
We believe that intra-operative physiological and clinical conﬁrmation of the target is crucial in
the ﬁnal position conﬁrmation. The initial anatomical and radiological planning is also essential in
target selection. Accurate preoperative planning would decrease the intra-operative time needed for
the MER and the number of the microelectrodes tracks needed to reach the target, and subsequently
decrease the complications. This fact is supported by our results, as our average number of MER tracks
was 1.4 tracks and our average surgical time was 214.8 min.
Twenty patients were included in the current study; their demographic characteristics are similar
to those of the patients included in other studies (Table 6). We only included patients who had the
disease for more than ﬁve years; this time period is recommended by CAPSIT-PD guidelines to
improve the accuracy of diagnosing idiopathic PD, because the deﬁning features of some of the
atypical Parkinsonian syndromes may appear late in the course of the disease, e.g., eye movement
abnormalities in PSP and autonomic dysfunction in MSA [28–31]. This time interval is agreed upon by
most authors in the literature, as the mean duration of the disease before surgery in previous studies
ranged from 6.8 to 16.4 years. The mean ± SD HYRS was 3.6 ± 0.7, ranging from 2.5 to 5.0.

In this study, we report signiﬁcant improvement in all the motor aspects of PD (UPDRS III)
and in ADL (UPDRS II) in the “off” medication state following bilateral STN stimulation. This was
accompanied by signiﬁcant reduction of both medication doses and medication-related adverse
effects. This improvement of motor function was signiﬁcant for the total UPDRS III score and
for all the motor subscores (tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and the axial score). The change
in UPDRS motor scores following surgery in the stimulation “on”, medication “off” condition
compared to the baseline medication “off” condition was used as the primary outcome measure
in many previous studies (Table 7). The improvement of UPDRS III score ranged from 38.3% to
66.5% [26,27,63,67–69,71,73–77,79–81] at one-year follow-up; with longer follow-up the beneﬁcial

effect of stimulation tends to decrease but scores remain signiﬁcantly better than preoperative
scores [22,26,68,69,71,77,79,80]. The deterioration seems to involve the axial manifestations of PD more
than the appendicular motor symptoms. This may be caused by the difference in the pathogenesis of
the axial symptoms from the other motor manifestations of PD [82]. The improvement of the UPDRS
II “off” score in other studies ranged from 17% to 68.5% and this improvement also tends to decrease
with a longer follow-up period [58,59,72,77,83].

The “on” medication, “on” stimulation total UPDRS III score and all the motor subscores showed
signiﬁcant improvement compared to the preoperative “on” medication. Some of the previous studies
showed signiﬁcant improvement at one-year UPDRS III “on” score [60,61], others non-signiﬁcant
improvement [58,62,71], but most studies showed deterioration (increase) of this score at longer
follow-up periods [26,32,69,74,76]. The UPDRS II “on” score showed little improvement compared to
the preoperative “on” state and it was statistically non-signiﬁcant. Few studies described signiﬁcant
improvement in this score [71]. Most of the previous studies showed non-signiﬁcant improvement
in the “on” state ADL [58–62,64–66]. After longer follow-up, previous studies showed signiﬁcant
deterioration in ADL (increase in score) [26,69,72,74,75]. The less obvious effect of stimulation on
the UPDRS III and UPDRS II in the medication “on” state in these studies can be explained by an
increase in bradykinesia and the axial sub-scores at the one-year follow-up. The insigniﬁcant change
of the “off” stimulation UPDRS III in both the “on” and the “off” medication states conﬁrms that the
improvement in the “on” stimulation scores is attributed to the DBS effect. Medication doses and
medication-induced side effects (dyskinesia and motor ﬂuctuations) were reduced by 65.1% and 48.6%,
respectively. These results are in agreement with previous studies (Table 8). The reduction of the LEDD
in previous studies ranged from 19.5% to 80.7% (Table 8).

The adverse events encountered in this group of patients were within the accepted complication
rate for DBS [84]. While we had one patient with ICH and one with wound dehiscence, both fortunately
recovered, one without permanent deﬁcits. While DBS is generally considered a safe procedure,
complications can occur and are usually classiﬁed into procedure-related, hardware-related,
and stimulation–related types [84]. The overall incidence of adverse effects related to surgery is
11%, but it is highly variable between studies [85]. Death is very rare after DBS surgery [62,86].
Procedure-related complications include intracranial hemorrhage (0%–3.9%) and sub-optimal electrode
placement (0%–2.5%). Hardware related complications account for 5%–18.5% of the complications;
they include lead fracture (0%–5%), lead migration (0%–3.5%), infections, and erosions (1%–9.7%).
Stimulation-related complications are the most common problems encountered after DBS surgery,
but most of them are reversible or can be avoided by adequate adjustment of the stimulation
parameters [69,87–89]. They include transient confusion and mood changes. Several studies found
that the effect of STN-DBS on overall cognitive functions is non-signiﬁcant and reversible [27,90–92],
consistent with the lack of changes from baseline in both the UPDRS I and MMSE scores in our study.
A commonly observed complication after DBS is weight gain (8.4%), which can be attributed to the
decrease in energy output due to the control of the abnormal movements [84,85,89,93]. Other, reversible,
stimulation-related adverse events include contralateral numbness, facial pulling, eye deviation,
dysphonia, and speech disturbances. Stimulation may also cause serious psychiatric adverse events
such as acute depression but they are reversible upon changing the stimulation parameters. In addition,
DBS may induce exacerbation of pre-existing mood disturbances and it is recommended that all
patients are screened preoperatively for psychiatric problems [92,94,95]. Nevertheless, patients should
not be ﬂat-out denied surgery based on a history of psychiatric illness. In some cases preoperative
psychosis or depressive symptoms may be caused by medications, and may therefore improve with
dose reduction after surgery [96].

5. Conclusions
Despite the limitations of this study as the assessments were not blinded to before vs. after
surgery, to medication status, or to DBS status, we can conclude that bilateral deep brain stimulation
of the subthalamic nucleus signiﬁcantly improves motor symptoms, activities of daily living,
and medication-induced complications in patients with advanced PD.

Abstract: Subthalamic nucleus (STN) local ﬁeld potentials (LFP) are neural signals that have been
shown to reveal motor and language behavior, as well as pathological parkinsonian states. We use a
research-grade implantable neurostimulator (INS) with data collection capabilities to record STN-LFP
outside the operating room to determine the reliability of the signals over time and assess their
dynamics with respect to behavior and dopaminergic medication. Seven subjects were implanted
with the recording augmented deep brain stimulation (DBS) system, and bilateral STN-LFP recordings
were collected in the clinic over twelve months. Subjects were cued to perform voluntary motor and
language behaviors in on and off medication states. The STN-LFP recorded with the INS demonstrated
behavior-modulated desynchronization of beta frequency (13–30 Hz) and synchronization of low
gamma frequency (35–70 Hz) oscillations. Dopaminergic medication did not diminish the relative
beta frequency oscillatory desynchronization with movement. However, movement-related gamma
frequency oscillatory synchronization was only observed in the medication on state. We observed
signiﬁcant inter-subject variability, but observed consistent STN-LFP activity across recording systems
and over a one-year period for each subject. These ﬁndings demonstrate that an INS system
can provide robust STN-LFP recordings in ambulatory patients, allowing for these signals to be
recorded in settings that better represent natural environments in which patients are in a variety of
medication states.

1. Introduction
The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a common target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy
in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). DBS alleviates the motor symptoms of PD [1], but may

lead to side effects, such as impaired cognition [2], speech [3,4], gait [5] and balance [6]. An adaptive
DBS system with active modulation of stimulation by appropriate physiological control variables may
reduce these side effects, while providing maximum therapeutic beneﬁt of PD motor symptoms [7–11].
Local ﬁeld potentials (LFP) recorded from the STN have the potential to be a robust control signal
to indicate a change in a patient’s state [12–15]. STN-LFPs have been shown to correlate with a
patient’s Parkinson’s disease symptom state [16], levodopa medication level [17,18], behavior [19–21]
and neurostimulation intensity [8]. Furthermore, LFP signals are stable over long periods of time,
as evidenced by recordings from the motor cortex [22] and STN [23,24], a necessary characteristic for a
feedback signal in a closed-loop DBS system.
In PD patients, the loss of nigral dopaminergic input to the striatum leads to the symptoms of
rigidity and bradykinesia [25] that are related to increased beta frequency oscillatory power (β power).
Decreased dopaminergic inputs to the basal ganglia promote synchronized oscillatory activity in
the beta frequency (13–30 Hz) of STN-LFP recordings [26–29] and have been shown to correlate
with worsening of rigidity and bradykinesia [16]. Prominent beta frequency oscillations can also be
observed from the cortical surface using EEG [17,30] and ECoG electrodes [31]. In concurrence with the
reduction of PD motor symptoms, dopaminergic therapy has been shown to suppress synchronized
beta frequency oscillations [17,18] and resulted in a new peak in the gamma frequency from 60 to
80 Hz [18] and in the high frequency oscillation of 300 Hz in STN-LFPs [32].
Beta frequency oscillations in the STN-LFP are reduced before and during voluntary
movements [21,27,33]. This event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the beta frequency behaves in a
manner consistent with movement-related processing in the cortex, speciﬁcally the supplementary
motor cortex [33]. Beta frequency desynchronization with movement suggests that beta suppression
may be a prerequisite of voluntary movement [34–36]. Levodopa therapy has been shown to increase
the duration and magnitude of relative pre-movement beta frequency ERD [37], strengthening the
hypothesis that beta ERD is a non-pathological phenomenon. Event-related synchronization (ERS),
or increases in power, occurs in subjects performing voluntary movements in the gamma frequency
(>35 Hz) of EEG signals recorded from the motor cortex [38]. This gamma ERS (increased γ power)
is felt to represent increased local neuronal computation and thus to reﬂect normal neural processes
necessary for movement. Synchronous gamma frequency oscillations also develop in STN-LFPs and
supplementary motor area activity in PD patients only after patients have been treated with levodopa
medication (medication “on” state) [17]. As this STN-LFP gamma ERS is only observed in a medication
on state, it is assumed to reﬂect normal neural processes, as in motor cortex.
STN-LFP activity in PD patients is traditionally recorded directly from the macroelectrodes on the
DBS lead intraoperatively or postoperatively, in the interval between lead implantation and subsequent
connection to the subcutaneous implantable neurostimulator (INS). In these controlled environments,
brief recordings are performed with subjects in a reclined operating table or hospital bed and may
not be representative of the variable recordings that will be present in a real-world setting. As PD
symptoms are dependent on the patient’s attention, alertness and behavior, the STN-LFP activity
likely varies with these factors, as well [39–43]. Therefore, inter-day variability will be a challenge
that must be addressed in a closed-loop DBS system. In this paper, we chronically record STN-LFP in
PD subjects in the medication on and off state while the subject is at rest and performing motor and
speech behavioral tasks using a DBS system that is augmented with LFP recording capability [24,44,45].
Reliable chronic recording of neural activity with a fully-implanted system is an imperative ﬁrst step
towards developing a closed-loop DBS system.

2.2. DBS Surgery
Subjects underwent DBS surgery in the off medication state per clinical routine. DBS lead
implantation surgery was performed with a Leksell (Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden) stereotactic head
frame and Surgiplan (Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden) targeting software. Targeting of the dorsolateral
STN was based on a combination of formula-based and indirect coordinates. We used an a priori,
formula-based target of (x, y, z): (±12 mm, −2 mm, −4 mm) with respect to the mid-commissural
point and anterior commissure (AC)–posterior commissure (PC) plane. Targeting was then adjusted
based on indirect targeting from the borders of the red nucleus (RN) for (x, y, z): (3 mm lateral to the
RN border, at the anterior border of RN, 2 mm inferior to the superior border of RN). The prescribed
sagittal trajectory angle was 60 degrees from the AC-PC plane, and the coronal angle was 15 degrees
from a parasagittal plane, with minor adjustments for cortical sulci and blood vessels. Microelectrodes
(Alpha Omega, Nazareth, Israel) were positioned in the center and anterior positions or the center,
anterior and lateral positions of a BenGun trajectory guide, with a parallel separation of 2 mm.
Moderate propofol anesthesia was used without a protected airway only during placement of the burr
hole. Clinical microelectrode recording was performed from 15 mm above to approximately 2 mm
below the target. Whereas subjects may have had residual effects from propofol during the initial
microelectrode recording though thalamic nuclei, we did not proceed with recording in the STN region
until patients were fully awake and conversant. After localization of the STN, the microelectrodes
were removed, and a permanent 4-electrode DBS lead (Medtronic 3389, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was
implanted in the optimal BenGun trajectory.
In a separate surgery, an implantable neurostimulator (INS) with additional voltage recording
capabilities [44] (Activa PC + S, Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) was implanted subcutaneously
to provide both standard therapeutic stimulation and bilateral local ﬁeld potential (LFP) recordings.
2.3. Data Collection
Simultaneous bilateral recordings were performed in all subjects. All recordings used a subset of
the 4 macroelectrodes of each DBS lead. The DBS lead electrode is platinum/iridium, has a surface
area of 6.0 mm2 and an impedance of 1.7 kΩ (mean; 95% CI = 1.1–2.4 kΩ) [21].

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 57

All subjects underwent an intraoperative (OR) data recording session during the initial
implantation surgery. Signals were ampliﬁed and digitized with a sampling frequency (Fs) of
4.8 kHz (g.USBamp, g.tec, Graz, Austria) and combined with event markers and subject response
signals [46]. Skin surface electrodes were used for ground and linked bilateral mastoid common
reference. LFP electrodes consisted of linearly-ordered contacts, with 0 being the most ventral and 3
being the most dorsal. Channels were bipolar re-referenced (0–1, 1–2, 2–3) prior to analysis for each
brain hemisphere.
Two types of postoperative INS recordings were performed: non-behavioral montage signal
review and behavioral dual bipolar recording. During the non-behavioral montage signal review,
all bipolar channel pairs from each hemisphere were ampliﬁed and digitized with a Fs of 422 Hz by
the INS for 30 s sequentially. During the behavioral recording, two bipolar re-referenced LFP signals,
one from each hemisphere, were ampliﬁed and digitized (Fs 422 Hz) by the INS (Table 2). Using the
initial montage signal review, the bipolar pair of channels that contained the most prominent peak
in beta frequency oscillations was selected for further behavioral recordings. This selection method
emphasized a relative strength of beta power over other frequencies. Simultaneously, the biopotential
of the skin over the INS was ampliﬁed and digitized (Fs 4.8 kHz) (g.USBamp, g.tec, Graz, Austria)
and combined with event markers and subject response signals [46]. The INS was used to produce
a 5-Hz, 2-V, 90-μs non-therapeutic stimulation signal at the beginning and end of each recording.
Digitized signals were then downloaded from the INS and synchronized to the external signals using
the artifacts produced by the non-therapeutic stimulation. Recordings were performed at 1, 3, 6 and
12 months after DBS lead implantation. Montage signal review was performed at each recording
session, and behavioral recordings were performed at Months 3 and 6. All postoperative recording
sessions were performed in the medication on state, except for the 6-month recording (Table 3).
Subject 1 did not have a postoperative recording session in the medication off state. At the time of
publication, all subjects have undergone the 1-, 3-, and 6-month sessions, and 5 of the 7 subjects have
undergone the 12-month session. Medication off recording sessions were performed after subjects
refrained from taking their prescribed levodopa medications for at least 12 h. Medication on recordings
sessions were performed while the subjects were administered their prescribed levodopa medication
dosage. All recordings were performed with the stimulation off.

2.4. Behavioral Tasks
Behavioral tasks were performed postoperatively and included motor and speech tasks. The motor
tasks were cued button pressing, a one out of eight target reaching for both the left and right arm/hand
and a cued tongue extension. The speech task was a cued reading aloud of one word presented on a
computer screen. Tasks were selected to evoke language- and motor-based neural activity in the STN
with precise and consistent timing for robust analysis. More speciﬁcally, button press was chosen as a
simple motor task that models ﬁnger tapping [21,47]. A reach task was selected as an alternative motor
task requiring larger muscle recruitment and coordination [48,49]. A brief speech task was chosen
because it was consistent in timing with the movement tasks, but similar tasks have been previously
used [21,50]. A mouth movement task was used as a comparison to the speech tasks. Each task was
repeated with a period of 5 s with a ± 0.5 s jitter in blocks of 11 trials for neurostimulator recordings
due to the memory constraints of the INS system with 10 s of reset between each block. The subject
was instructed to return to a comfortable resting position between each trial, so the period immediately
preceding the cue could be used as a baseline resting state. The entire paradigm was performed up to
three times during each session based on subject fatigue. For task initiation, subjects received an audio
and visual cue from a presentation computer running a custom Python application (Python Software
Foundation, version 3.5, Wilmington, DE, USA). A random time factor (± 0.5 s) was programmed into
the trial period length to reduce any effect of anticipation.
2.5. Analysis
Time series data of subject response channels were reviewed to mark motor and speech onset and
offset times for tasks. Button press responses were extracted from the digital input channel using a
threshold algorithm. Reaching motor responses were extracted from the touch-screen monitor digital
input channel using a threshold algorithm. Both button and touch-screen inputs were recorded
as digital channels; using a threshold of 0.5, values above this threshold (1) indicate a response,
while values below this threshold (0) indicate no response. The sensitivities of the button and the
touch-screen were left at their factory set defaults. Tongue extension responses were marked from the
ﬁrst time synced video frame the tongue was visible until the last video frame the tongue was visible.
Speech responses were manually marked from the start of the ﬁrst audible syllable above the noise
ﬂoor until the end of the last audible syllable above the noise ﬂoor in the time-synced audio channel.
Power spectral density estimates were calculated using a custom Welch’s method with 50%
overlapping Hanning windowed segments of 256 samples padded to 1024 samples for a frequency
resolution of 422/1024 (~0.412 Hz). Time-dependent power spectral density estimates were calculated
using both wavelet analysis and a ﬁxed-window short time Fourier transform technique [51,52].
Wavelet analysis utilized complex Morlet wavelets and operated on time-by-trial event matrices
based on subject response time markers. Button press motor action onset and offset were determined
by the digital input channel. For reach motor action, trials were aligned by touch-screen response
timing (i.e., at the completion of the reach motion, when the subject hits the target). To measure ERDs,
the number of pixels of signiﬁcant desynchronization in the area of interest around the event were
summed. Ratios between two different ERD measures were then computed to compare spectrograms
and remove the dependence on pixel density; Student’s t-tests were used to compare these ratios
against 1 as a signiﬁcance test.
2.6. Statistics
Permutation (bootstrap) analyses were applied to the spectrogram response matrices to determine
signiﬁcant deviation from the baseline of ERS or ERD [21]. These matrices were built using entire-record
normalized log transformed data, baselined on a trial-by-trial basis. A time window of 500-ms duration,
terminating 100 ms before the cue, was used for baseline data for all tasks. A permutation “sign-test”
was performed using randomly-sampled trials without replacement using a custom Python script.

29

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 57

For each permutation, the sign of half of the trials was inverted and a new average generated. The null
hypothesis states that no ERSs or ERDs are signiﬁcantly different from zero, and therefore, inversion
of the sign would be expected to increase the absolute value of the average for a substantial number
of permutations. For the alternate hypothesis, ERSs or ERDs are signiﬁcantly different from zero,
and inversion would be expected to decrease the absolute value of the average.
To correct for multiple comparisons, we conservatively assumed that each 50-ms segment could
be considered an independent sample. We calculated the number of permutations, such that the
resolution of our p-value was 1/5 of the corrected signiﬁcance value for an alpha error of 5%.
This calculation was 5 × (((spectrogram duration)/50 ms)/5%) permutations, which gives corrected
p-value resolutions of 1/permutations. The spectrogram duration used for statistical analysis and the
number of permutations for each task are as follows: button press task, 4 s and 8000 permutations;
reach task, 5 s and 10,000 permutations; tongue extension task, 4 s and 8000 permutations; speech task,
4 s and 8000 permutations. To calculate our p-value, we counted the number of permutations that
created a new mean greater than the original mean and multiplied this count by the resolution of our
p-value, producing a statistical matrix. If the permutation mean was greater than the original mean,
no more than the 5/permutations fraction, the null hypothesis was rejected for that pixel, and it was
deemed signiﬁcant.
The Pearson product-moment correlation coefﬁcient was applied to pairs of calculated power
spectral density (PSD) estimations to test for signiﬁcant spectral correlation between STN-LFP
recordings at different times or in different states. Bonferroni correction was applied when testing
multiple pairs.
3. Results
STN-LFP activity from fourteen hemispheres of seven PD subjects was analyzed. The mean
age of the subjects at DBS lead implant was 61 ± 9 years. Two subjects were female. All subjects
were evaluated preoperatively using the uniﬁed Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) III in the
medication on and off state. Six of seven subjects were evaluated postoperatively using the UPDRS III in
the medication on and off state and DBS stimulation on and off state. Predominant PD symptoms with
a notably high value in the initial UPDRS evaluation prior to DBS implantation included bradykinesia,
rigidity, dyskinesias, gait disturbances and tremor. Clinical DBS settings from the last recording session
can be viewed in Table 1.
STN-LFPs recorded with an external ampliﬁer in the operating room and an INS system in the
clinic at six months post lead implantation both yield signals with similar characteristics. Peaks in
the beta frequency were visible in 19 out of 36 PSD estimates in the OR recordings and 15 out of
36 PSD estimates in the six-month INS recordings. Beta frequency peaks varied in amplitude and
speciﬁc frequency range by subject. Figure 1 demonstrates the PSD estimation of representative
bipolar channel pairs in the acute and chronic setting for each subject. Although the INS was set at
a lower sampling rate of 422 Hz compared to 4.8 kHz (Table 2), the spectral content of the signals
was comparable with a characteristic one/frequency curve common in LFP signals. A peak at 60 Hz
was visible in two of the six subjects in the intraoperative recording session due to environmental line
noise. No 60-Hz artifacts were visible in the postoperative recording sessions with the INS system.
Across the full set of bipolar channel pairs, 33 of 36 recordings showed signiﬁcant correlation between
PSD estimations derived from recordings in the acute and chronic setting (multiple correlation tests
with Bonferroni correction, α = 0.05/36 (~0.0014)). Channel pairs that had PSD estimations that were
signiﬁcantly different included one channel pair with an impedance consistent with an electrical short
(Subject 3) and two channel pairs with a large amount of 60-Hz line noise due to a lack of stable ground
connection in the OR recording (Subject 5).

systems in acute and chronic environments. Representative power spectral density (PSD) estimations
of 30-s STN-LFP epochs with subjects at rest in the medication off state are presented. One bipolar
channel pair was selected for each subject as an exemplar PSD. The selected bipolar channel pairs
for Subjects 2, 3, 5 and 6 were left hemisphere Channels 1 and 2. The selected bipolar channel pairs
for Subjects 4 and 7 were right hemisphere Channels 1 and 2. Implantable neurostimulator (INS)
digitized signals were recorded at six months post deep brain stimulation (DBS) lead implantation in
the medication off state, and STN-LFP signals were recorded in the operating room (OR) during DBS
lead implantation. Prominent peaks in the beta frequency were observable in both types of recordings.
Subject 1 did not have a recording in the medication off state.

STN-LFPs recorded while each subject was at rest were compared across one year. Similar to the
comparison of recording ampliﬁers, the spectral content in STN-LFP signals varied across subjects,
but remained consistent across sessions within subjects (Figure 2). Prominent peaks in beta frequency
were visible in 18 out of 36 PSD estimations in the on medication state (Month 3) and 15 of 36 of
PSD estimations in the off medication state (Month 6). Peaks in beta frequency varied in amplitude
and speciﬁc frequency range by subject. The average beta frequency (13–30 Hz) maximum for each
subject across all recording sessions ranged from 16.0–25.5 Hz with an average across all subjects
of 20.4 ± 4.1 Hz. In early recording sessions, the power analysis subsystem of the INS recording
system was programmed to a suboptimal setting that led to a contaminate signal in the recording
at the 25, 50 and 75 Hz as seen in PSD estimation for the 1-, 3- and 6-month session for Subject
2, the 1-, 3- and 6-month sessions for Subject 3 and the one-month session for Subjects 1 and 5.
This contamination was later avoided by conﬁguring the power analysis subsystem into lower
priority frequencies to minimize its impact on the recording. Within subjects, all but one channel pair
showed signiﬁcant correlation between INS PSD estimations over time (multiple correlation tests with
Bonferroni correction, α = 0.05/216 (~0.0002))) (Table S1). The inconsistent channel pair was due to an
electrical short in one channel pair in Subject 3.
STN-LFP activity was further examined for differences between therapeutic and nontherapeutic
contacts, as well as differences from the medication on and off state. The spectral content of STN-LFP
activity recorded from therapeutic and non-therapeutic contacts while the subjects were at rest in
the medication off state at six months was compared (Figure 3). Therapeutic contacts were the active
(negative) contact selected by the subject’s neurologist. The therapeutic electrode was deduced
after testing each cathode using 60 μs, 130 Hz and selecting the cathode that was most effective
in reducing rigidity, bradykinesia and/or tremor with priority given to the efﬁcacious cathode
requiring the lowest amplitude to reach the most effective symptom reduction. Side effects were
not a factor in selecting the most effective (therapeutic) cathode; however, stimulation-induced
side effects were a factor in selecting polarity and pulse width. Clinical DBS settings are listed
in Table 1. For Subject 5, a double cathode was used to expand the area of activation when side
effects limited the increase in amplitude and pulse width. Therapeutic bipolar channel pairs consisted
of at least one therapeutic contact. A prominent peak in beta frequency power was observed in
16 of the 25 therapeutic bipolar channel pairs, although the size and shape of the beta frequency
peak was inconsistent across subjects. Notably, eight of 11 non-therapeutic bipolar channel pairs

31

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 57

lacked prominent peaks in the beta frequency. Examining only therapeutic bipolar channel pairs
across all subjects, there was not a signiﬁcant decrease in total beta frequency power in the STN-LFP
activity recorded at three months post lead implantation with subjects in the medication on state
compared to the STN-LFP activity recorded at six months post lead implantation in the medication
off state (paired t-test with Bonferroni correction, α = 0.05/6 (~0.0083)). Furthermore, there were no
signiﬁcant interactions between therapeutic/non-therapeutic bipolar channels and medication or
the laterality of the bipolar channels and medication when measuring total beta power (two-factor
ANOVA, α = 0.05). The overall change in total beta power from the on medication to off medication
state was −0.28% ± −0.1%. If subjects who exhibited an increase in beta frequency power in the on
medication state were excluded, there remained a minimal effect with an average 9% ± 3% decrease in
beta frequency power in the on medication state in comparison to the off medication state (Figure S1).

Figure 2. Stability of subthalamic nucleus (STN) local ﬁeld potential (LFP) signals recorded with an
implantable neurostimulator over one year. Representative PSD estimations of 30-s STN-LFP epochs
with subjects at rest over one year are presented. One bipolar channel pair was selected for each
subject as an exemplar PSD. The selected bipolar channel pairs for Subjects 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 were left
hemisphere Channels 1 and 2. The selected bipolar channel pair for Subject 7 was right hemisphere
Channels 1 and 2. Figure S4 provides the PSDs for all bipolar channel pairs. STN-LFP frequency content
was visibly consistent across multiple recording sessions. Legends denote recording date in months
post-surgical implantation * Denotes recording sessions in which the subject was in the medication
off state.

STN-LFP event-related power changes were examined in the medication on and off state at
three and six months post DBS lead implantation. All subjects completed six different cued tasks in
four categories, left and right button press with a combined reaction time of 0.49 ± 0.18 s, left and
right reaching with a combined reaction time of 1.37 ± 0.38, tongue extension with a reaction time
of 0.61 ± 0.28 and cued reading with a reaction time of 0.75 ± 0.22. Signiﬁcant changes in relative
power were generally limited to beta (13–30 Hz) and low gamma (35–70 Hz) frequencies, although some
signiﬁcant changes in relative power were visible in frequencies below 13 Hz (Figure 4). The relative
ERD of beta and the ERS of gamma frequency oscillations were present in all behaviors, but signiﬁcant
changes in gamma oscillations were not consistently present in all subjects. Gamma ERS was only
observed in the medication on state. Dopaminergic medication did not diminish the magnitude of
the beta ERD. Across all subjects, dopaminergic medication produced a signiﬁcant increase in the
relative magnitude and duration of beta frequency ERD for all behaviors, except right button press;
see Figure S2 (paired t-test, α = 0.05). Event-related power change patterns over time were variable
across behaviors. Left and right arm reach to target movement had the longest duration of relative
power change. Unlike the other behavioral tasks, time zero marked when the subject completed the
reach at the highlighted target, prior to moving back to resting position. Brief, relative signiﬁcant
changes in power occurred with left and right hand movement. Similar to limb movements, speech and
mouth movement showed signiﬁcant beta ERD and gamma ERS.

4. Discussion
In this study, we examine the inﬂuence of medication and behavior on STN-LFP features in PD
subjects over one year. With the expected ongoing development of closed-loop DBS systems that
utilize features of the LFP as a control signal, the stability of this feature modulation in response to
patient factors (behavior, medication) is critical to establish.
The INS system used in this study is an early step in the development of a closed-loop DBS system.
The signiﬁcant advantage of this system is the ability to chronically record STN-LFP. As an implanted
system, advantages include the absence of movement artifacts and line noise that contaminate
traditional LFP recordings, as seen in Figure 1, and the ability to record LFP signals in a variety
of environments and medication states. The INS system utilized in this study is the ﬁrst of its kind to
be implanted in patients [24,44,45]. Two previous studies have utilized the same INS system to examine
STN-LFP activity while subjects were performing different behaviors and with varying amplitudes of
deep brain stimulation. Although one study was performed in non-human primates [45] and the other
in human subjects [24], both studies were able to record reliable LFP signals that were comparable
to intraoperative STN-LFP signals. Behavioral recording sessions with the INS are limited in length,
number of channels and sampling rate. Recording sessions are stored to an internal memory and
retrieved as a second step. The two-step procedure also increases the amount of time that our subjects
give to the project. For our recording sessions, we conﬁgured the device to record two time-domain
channels at Fs 422 Hz without compression, and internal memory restrictions limited recordings to
15 min. Next generation devices may address many of these limitations by increasing the number of
simultaneous recording channels and streaming the data in real time, eliminating the recording time
limit and decreasing the time needed for each subject visit.
The INS device used in this study is powered by a non-rechargeable battery that is shared with
the neurostimulation circuitry. Thus, utilization of the sensing technology potentially reduces the
lifetime of the stimulator. Furthermore, the power analysis subsystem circuitry of the INS system
produces a crossover signal in the time domain recording at the conﬁgured frequency. By changing the
conﬁgured power analysis frequency, this contamination can be moved into lower priority frequencies
to minimize its impact on the recording. However, our site had noticeable peaks in their PSD at 25,
50 and 75 Hz in early recordings. These artifacts at 25, 50 and 75 Hz did not affect our analysis of
beta power at rest or with an event. All our INS recordings were performed with the stimulation
off. Active stimulation would create more artifacts in DBS lead recordings, but setting recording
parameters, such as the INS recording gain and channel conﬁguration, can limit the inﬂuence of
stimulation artifact on the recording signal. Furthermore, many groups are examining methods to
remove stimulation artifacts [53–55] from STN-LFP.
The STN-LFP activity varied between subjects, but was consistent within subjects across recording
systems and over a one-year time period. In our study, we found consistent spectral content of LFP
activity less than 100 Hz across the one year of recordings. The stability of LFPs has been previously
examined up to a span of seven years post DBS implantation. Similar to our ﬁndings, beta band
amplitude was consistent at three weeks post DBS lead. However, the amplitude decreased at
two to seven years after the DBS implant [23]. In the medication on and off states, we observed a
prominent peak in beta frequency power spectral density. Beta power from STN-LFP recorded from
therapeutic contacts while the subject was at rest did not signiﬁcantly vary with medication state.
Therapeutic contacts were selected for this analysis because they have been found to have higher
beta power in comparison to non-therapeutic contacts in previous studies and in our results [56,57].
The suppression of beta frequency activity in the resting state with dopaminergic medication has been
observed in other studies [17,18,37], but was inconsistent in our study.
Similar to previous work, beta ERD was demonstrated to be coincident with a behavioral task [23].
The amplitude of this modulation, relative to a baseline period immediately preceding the cue to start
movement, was greater in the medication on state in ﬁve of six tasks. This phenomenon, although
counter to the pathological hypothesis of beta frequency rhythms in Parkinson’s disease, has been
35

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 57

previously observed [24]. This work reinforces the theory that dopaminergic mechanisms facilitate
movement-related beta desynchronization. The gamma ERS was, as expected, present only in the
medication on state, but was inconsistently observed. However, the frequency of gamma ERS in our
study was in a lower gamma range than has been observed in previous studies [32,33,58]. Left and right
reaching movements elicited the largest difference between medication on and off states, likely because
this behavior involved sustained gross motor movement of the entire arm, where other behaviors were
more restricted.
We acknowledge that there are limitations of the current study with respect to our ﬁndings on the
medication effect on beta power. We demonstrated that there was no signiﬁcant medication effect on
overall beta power present at rest. Furthermore, the on medication state had a signiﬁcant inﬂuence
on the strength and duration of beta ERD, when compared to the pre-activity baseline. However,
comparing STN-LFP activity during the medication on state at three months to the medication off state
at six months would be dependent on a time factor, as well as the medication state. It is possible the
recordings at six months could be inﬂuenced by a degradation of the signal. We were not able to collect
on and off medication data at each three- and six-month encounter. In designing the study, we wanted
to preserve the lifetime of the generator and limit the number of recording sessions we performed,
while extending the recording to 12 months after DBS implant. We do not believe that our results were
due to overall degradation of recording over time. As seen in Figure S4, for the channels chosen for
behavioral recordings (Table 1), the prominent beta peak was consistent across 3, 6 and 12 months.
Furthermore, the increase in impedance from 3–6 months was minimal at 2.6% ± 18%. We believe
this small change in impedance is within the typical range of variability seen in DBS systems [59]
and, therefore, demonstrates that the impedances were stable between the two recording sessions.
The current study was designed to explore changes in frequency with behavioral tasks, but not to
fully elucidate the medication effect. Investigations particularly designed to address this question are
planned for future studies.
The magnitude and time course of beta and low gamma power modulation in response to behavior
were variable between subjects. This synchronization/desynchronization modulation did not reach
signiﬁcance for certain subjects. Sources for variation between subjects may stem from differences
in DBS lead location within the STN, the level of patient’s PD progression, prescribed medication,
predominant PD symptoms and unknown factors. This variability has direct implications for the
development of closed loop systems. From our work, only a subset of subjects had reliably signiﬁcant
movement-related synchronization patterns for targeting as a control signal for DBS [11]. Strategies for
surgical targeting regions of the STN where control signals are optimum may be required for closed
loop systems. In this study, surgical targeting was not considered for optimal STN-LFP signals, as the
utilization of these signals is not standard clinical practice.
5. Conclusions
Our study examined the inﬂuence of medication and behavior on STN-LFP activity in PD patients
over one year. Many groups are currently investigating appropriate neurophysiological biomarkers
to be used as a feedback signal in a closed-loop DBS system [11,49,60–62]. The INS system in our
study was able to consistently record LFP power ﬂuctuations with behavior, demonstrating an ability
to utilize STN-LFP signals as a surrogate for behavioral program activation in a closed-loop DBS
system. Although the number of simple behavioral tasks performed by subjects was limited, STN-LFP
activity was sensitive to the particular type of motor program. Patterns within STN-LFP signals
have been determined to be speciﬁc to different motor programs allowing for high classiﬁcation
rates [20]. The data presented demonstrate that STN-LFP activity may be an appropriate feedback
signal that is stable over time, providing relevant patient-speciﬁc information on a subject’s behavior
and medication level.

Abstract: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a unique, functional neurosurgical therapy
indicated for medication refractory movement disorders as well as some psychiatric diseases.
Multicontact electrodes are placed in “deep” structures within the brain with targets varying
depending on the surgical indication. An implanted programmable pulse generator supplies the
electrodes with a chronic, high frequency electrical current that clinically mimics the effects of ablative
lesioning techniques. DBS’s efﬁcacy has been well established for its movement disorder indications
(Parkinson’s disease, essential tremor, and dystonia). However, clinical outcomes are sometimes
suboptimal, even in the absence of common, potentially reversible complications such as hardware
complications, infection, poor electrode placement, and poor programming parameters. This review
highlights some of the rescue procedures that have been explored in suboptimal DBS cases for
Parkinson’s disease, essential tremor, and dystonia. To date, the data is limited and difﬁcult to
generalize, but a large majority of published reports demonstrate positive results. The decision to
proceed with such treatments should be made on a case by case basis. Larger studies are needed to
clearly establish the beneﬁt of rescue procedures and to establish for which patient populations they
may be most appropriate.

1. Introduction
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a unique and exciting functional neurosurgical therapy, allowing
for easily adjustable post-surgical changes to an implanted programmable device, which maximizes
long-term clinical outcomes. It involves neurosurgical implantation of multicontact electrodes either
unilaterally or bilaterally in speciﬁc anatomical areas “deep” within the brain. Targets vary depending
on the indication for surgery. These electrodes are connected by a tunneled extension wire to a pulse
generator, or neurostimulator, typically implanted in a subcutaneous pocket below the clavicle.
The neurostimulator provides a modiﬁable, high frequency electrical current that modulates the
neurocircuitry surrounding the electrodes, clinically mimicking the effects of ablative stereotactic
lesioning techniques [1,2]. The stimulation parameters (amplitude, pulse width and frequency) as well
as activated contact(s) can be easily adjusted by the treating physician in the clinic. Depending on
the comfort level of the physician, patients can also be given varying levels of control over their
programming settings. DBS has Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in two conditions,
Parkinson’s disease (PD) and essential tremor (ET). DBS also has a humanitarian device exemption
for dystonia and obsessive compulsive disorder. Outside of these approved indications, DBS has

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 46

been used for a variety of conditions including Parkinson’s plus disorders, Huntington’s disease,
Tourette’s, Alzheimer’s, epilepsy, chronic pain, major depression, post-traumatic stress disorder,
and schizophrenia among others [3]. In general, DBS is indicated in all its approved conditions
when prospective patients are symptomatically severe and refractory to medical treatment, or when
medication adverse effects become intolerable [4].
The process of selecting proper candidates for DBS, successfully implanting the electrode(s)
in the proper location, and appropriately programming the DBS device is complex. When done
correctly, the efﬁcacy of DBS is well established [5–8]. However, in some instances, even under optimal
circumstances with a multidisciplinary team approach, DBS can lead to suboptimal results either
immediately after the initial surgery or, later, as symptom beneﬁt declines [9–11]. When common
and reversible complications such as hardware issues, improper lead positioning and inadequate
programming are ruled out, the patient and clinicians are left with the difﬁcult decision of what to
do next. DBS centers have trialed various options including the use of additional or “rescue” DBS
lead(s), moving the established lead to another location, or subsequently using lesioning therapy.
Given a paucity of data, it can be difﬁcult for centers to make decisions. It can also be difﬁcult to
counsel patients and their families as outcomes are not clear. Obtaining consent and appropriately
detailing out risks and beneﬁts in such situations comes with inherent difﬁculties and should be given
careful attention by the DBS team [12,13]. This review will highlight the available data on some of the
techniques used after suboptimal DBS results in PD, ET, and dystonia patients.
2. Parkinson’s Disease
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of
dopaminergic neurons and the buildup of intracellular inclusions called Lewy bodies composed of
alpha synuclein. Clinically, it manifests as both the diagnostic motor features (tremor, bradykinesia,
rigidity, and postural instability) as well as a myriad of non-motor features (autonomic instability,
neuropsychiatric decline, sleep disorders, pain, etc.). PD medications primarily involve modulation
of the dopaminergic pathway and target motor features, whereas non-motor features are much more
difﬁcult to treat.
DBS is a proven adjunctive surgical therapy for treatment of the motor symptoms of PD [6,14,15].
It is currently approved for levodopa-responsive PD patients with at least 4 years of disease not
adequately controlled with medication or whose treatment is complicated by medication-related side
effects (i.e., motor ﬂuctuations, dyskinesias). The surgery has been approved for PD since 2002 with
recent indications suggesting that earlier usage in the disease may be effective [16]. Compared to best
medical therapy alone, DBS in conjunction with medication has been proven far superior. Studies have
demonstrated a notable improvement in quality of life, motor scores, and a reduction of wearing off
in patients who have received DBS [17–19]. Overall beneﬁts have been maintained for up to 11 years
according to long-term follow-up studies [20–22] although there is some concern that any initial beneﬁt
in gait or posture may deteriorate more quickly [23].
The most commonly used targets are the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus internus
(GPi). Large comparative trials have demonstrated equal beneﬁt in regards to the overall treatment
of PD motor symptoms between targets [6,24]. However, there were subtle differences identiﬁed,
which are still continuously being explored. For example, STN stimulation classically has allowed
for greater medication reduction post-surgery, and GPi stimulation has seemed more advantageous
for patients with depression, greater balance difﬁculty, and impairments in verbal ﬂuency [6,24,25].
The longest follow-up in the large trials directly comparing the two targets was 24 months [6,24].
There is still no unifying consensus on speciﬁc criteria for favoring one target over the other with the
current data. Different DBS centers still differ on their approaches for target selection and often will
use the target with which they have the most experience and comfort.
DBS in these two targets can be said to have “failed” for many reasons. Some of the more common
reasons include improper patient selection, suboptimal electrode placement, suboptimal management

42

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 46

(programming and medications), hardware complications (infection, lead fracture, dead battery),
and progression of PD such that symptoms not modiﬁed by DBS become the patient’s primary
disability [11]. Exclusive of these more common reasons for failure of PD DBS, patients can still have
inadequate or progressively lessening motor beneﬁt despite good lead positioning and programming
parameters [10,11]. This can manifest as reemergence of dystonia, worsening in motor ﬂuctuations and
dyskinesias, and progression in the cardinal motor symptoms (tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity) initially
modiﬁed by DBS [10,11]. In certain patients, up titration of dopaminergics in attempts to adequately
control breakthrough symptoms can also lead to disabling side effects (neuropsychiatric changes,
fatigue, sleep disruption, impulse control disorders, orthostatic hypotension, and dyskinesia among
others). Case studies and series have reported using additional leads in the other primary PD DBS
target (i.e., STN stimulation to rescue failed GPi stimulation and vice versa) in these circumstances
with some success [15,26–30].
Published cases where patients underwent GPi stimulation for failed STN stimulation generally
report patients with a young age of disease onset (average age 41) and a long interval of success with
their initial STN surgery (average of 8 years until rescue surgery) [26,27,29,30]. In all reviewed cases,
the reason for failure was disabling dyskinesia or dystonia. Discontinuation of STN stimulation
after initiation of GPi stimulation sometimes led to worse control of cardinal motor features,
leading to continued STN stimulation in four of seven cases reviewed [26,27,29,30]. Of the seven
cases, six achieved a clinically signiﬁcant beneﬁt with the addition of GPi stimulation [26,27,29,30].
Beneﬁts included reduction in the dystonia, dyskinesia, and levodopa equivalent daily dose
(i.e., total medication needed) [26,27,29,30].
In the six cases reviewed where STN stimulation was used to rescue failed GPi stimulation, the
reason for failure was worsening motor symptoms soon after surgery (within the ﬁrst 2–3 years) [15,28].
Average age at disease onset was also in the 40s (exact ages at onset unavailable from one study).
Notably, in three of the six cases, there were hardware complications that necessitated the removal
of at least one GPi electrode prior to the use of rescue leads [15,28]. In all cases, STN stimulation
replaced GPi stimulation, rather than stimulation of both regions, as the GPi leads were already
removed in all patients [15,28]. STN stimulation led to improved United Parkinson’s disease Rating
Scale Part III (UPDRS-III) scores, decreased levodopa daily dose, and cessation of or improvement in
dyskinesia [15,28].
Another interesting rescue procedure reported by Deligny et al. was that of a bilateral
subthalamotomy performed through DBS electrodes prior to their removal due to hardware
infection [31]. In this case, radiofrequency subthalamotomy through the leads led to a durable beneﬁt
in measured motor scores, dyskinesia and off times [31]. Unfortunately, after the procedure, there were
some mild cognitive and motivation side effects witnessed as well [31].
Finally, other targets besides the STN and GPi have been explored in PD DBS such as the
pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN). This target has primarily been used for PD patients suffering from
freezing of gait (FOG) and other gait disturbances, either as the sole target or in combination with
STN DBS. It has the potential to be used as a rescue target in the future but further study is needed.
The PPN was initially chosen as a potential DBS target given work in animal models which has
shown the PPN plays a signiﬁcant role in the normal operation of axial muscles which help regulate
posture and gait [32–34]. FOG is a disabling symptom commonly seen in PD where patients literally
“freeze” to the ﬂoor when they attempt to ambulate. It commonly occurs with the initiation of gait,
with turning or when maneuvering in tight spaces such as doorways and crowds [35,36]. FOG is
generally refractory to medications and STN/GPi DBS [37]. Several studies were reviewed that looked
at the PPN as the sole target in PD patients with postural instability and gait symptoms (PIGD). A
recent meta-analysis was performed on 10 such studies [37]. While there was a statistically signiﬁcant
improvement in motor symptoms and postural instability, the meta-analysis did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant
improvement in FOG [37]. The improvement in motor symptoms was also less substantial with PPN
stimulation than has been found with STN or GPi stimulation [37]. In contrast, an interesting study

43

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 46

by Stefani et al. looked at six PD patients with axial signs simultaneously implanted in the PPN and
STN [38]. Patients were analyzed 2–6 months after surgery in ON/OFF medication states with either
or both targets activated. The PPN was particularly effective for gait and posture, and the combination
of the targets being “on” was superior to one alone [38]. Liu et al. also report a case of a PD patient
with FOG implanted simultaneously with bilateral PPN and STN leads [39]. The investigators did
not test the leads in both targets simultaneously due to problems with dizziness when all leads were
activated. However, on testing individual targets, sole stimulation of the PPN leads did show some
beneﬁt in the gait problems whereas the STN leads did not [39].
In summary, case reports of rescue procedures for PD have been generally positive, though follow-up
has been short. Typically, rescue procedures have involved stimulation of the approved target that was
not originally implanted (i.e., STN for failed GPi or vice versa). Subthalamotomy performed through
existing DBS electrodes has also been attempted. Rescue procedures seem to be more common in those
with a young age of disease onset. Stimulation of the PPN is also an intriguing idea both as an initial
therapy and a rescue therapy for those with more axial symptoms and FOG, but currently further study
is still needed.
3. Essential Tremor
Essential tremor (ET) is the most commonly seen movement disorder [40]. Clinically, it typically
manifests as a bilateral action and postural tremor. The disease commonly runs in families, suggesting a
hereditary component, yet a speciﬁc genetic cause has not been identiﬁed [40]. Common therapeutic
medications include primidone, beta blockers, topiramate and gabapentin.
DBS is a proven surgical option for medication refractory ET. The accepted target is the ventral
intermediate (VIM) nucleus of the thalamus. Unilateral DBS for ET received FDA approval in 1997
although it is commonly used bilaterally. Response to stimulation is often robust, with studies
demonstrating >80% tremor improvement [7,8]. Studies have also demonstrated that this beneﬁt can
be persistent over a long period of time (>12 years) [41–43].
In some cases, however, the beneﬁts of DBS either are suboptimal or diminish irrespective of
inaccurate lead placement, hardware complications or other device issues [11,44]. Possible reasons
for diminishing response include disease progression and tolerance to stimulation. Several different
rescue techniques have been attempted to improve tremor control in these patients. Some DBS centers
have attempted to either add additional leads or reposition in a second target. These other targets
have primarily included the STN, caudal zona inserta (cZI), or the ventralis oralis anterior nucleus
of the thalamus (VOA) [9,45,46]. Many of these newer targets were selected to see if stimulation of
the subthalamic areas (STN, cZI, prelemniscal radiations) would produce similar results to previously
used lesioning approaches. Subthalamotomy has been an efﬁcacious surgical option for tremor dating
back to the 1960s [47–49]. Our institution has also tried adding a second thalamic lead anterior to the
VIM, using the combination of the VOA and VIM leads together to direct current away from structures
causing stimulation-induced side effects and allow for more aggressive stimulation parameters [50–52].
In a case series by Blomstedt et al., patients who had failed VIM stimulation underwent
re-implantation in the cZI [9]. In this series, they reported a 57% improvement in tremor control with
cZI stimulation, compared to a 25% improvement in tremor control with prior VIM stimulation [9].
Within their cohort (n = 5), however, two of the patients had relatively immediate failure of their VIM
leads (<6 months) [9]. This may suggest an initial improper positioning of the leads as opposed to
true superiority of the cZI over VIM. The other three patients received their cZI lead implantation an
average of 9 years after VIM implantation with beneﬁt [9].
In two series by Mehanna et al. and Oyama et al., a total of seven patients underwent a second
operation into the VOA, STN, or prelemniscal radiations for failed VIM stimulation [45,46]. Six of the
seven patients had mild to moderate improvement after reoperation [45,46]. In some patients, the
physicians used simultaneous stimulation of both the new target and VIM, while others had stimulation
of the new target alone [45,46]. A shortcoming of these series is the heterogeneity of the patient

44

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 46

population and treatment strategies. Four of the seven patients did not have ET [45,46]. Rather, two had
multiple sclerosis induced tremor, one had tremor from a treated thalamic anteriovenous malformation
and one had an atypical tremor of unknown cause [45,46]. In the three patients with ET, one had
maximal tremor control with the VOA rescue lead stimulated alone. The other two had maximal tremor
control with simultaneous stimulation of VIM and the new target (one in the VOA and one in the
prelemniscal radiations). The varying treatment strategies (different targets and different combinations
of stimulation) make this data difﬁcult to interpret.
Yu et al., Isaacs et al. and Sukul et al. from our institution [50–52] published a series in which
they used the placement of a second electrode in the thalamus antero-medially to the VIM to direct
stimulation away from structures causing stimulation-induced side effects (such as the internal capsule
and ventralis caudalis nucleus of the thalamus) [50–52]. Limiting side effects from the initial lead
included severe paresthesias, diplopia, dysarthria, and dizziness. The leads were connected in parallel
to a common voltage source allowing more control over the ﬁeld of stimulation [50–52]. Directing the
stimulation away from unintended targets allowed for more aggressive stimulation parameters with
essentially equivalent or better tremor control and reduced side effects in all patients [50–52].
Bahgat et al. retrospectively reviewed seven patients with ET who underwent unilateral
thalamotomy as a rescue procedure after failed VIM DBS [53]. Reasons for failure in these
patients included intolerable side effects, malpositioned electrodes, and symptom progression [53].
After thalamotomy, six of the seven patients reported symptomatic improvement, though only three of
those six reported corresponding functional improvement and one patient reported no improvement
at all [53]. However, only one patient had a signiﬁcant persistent adverse effect in the form of facial
numbness from thalamotomy after DBS [53].
In summary, case reports of rescue procedures for ET have also been generally positive, though
cohorts have been notably heterogeneous. Several newer targets have been tried in combination with
and as a replacement for VIM stimulation, which has raised the possibility of a synergistic effect of
stimulating different regions. Thalamotomy for failed DBS had modest success. An alternative rescue
approach with favorable results has been implanting additional thalamic leads to direct stimulation
away from structures responsible for intolerable side effects.
4. Dystonia
Dystonia is an unusual movement disorder characterized by sustained and repetitive muscle
contraction, often resulting in abnormal posturing [54]. The exact pathophysiology is not known,
but the origin appears to be in the basal ganglia. Dystonia can be from a variety of causes such
as genetic abnormalities, neurodegenerative conditions, structural changes or insults to the brain,
chemical exposures, or medications among others [55,56]. It also has a varied clinical presentation,
presenting either as a focal dystonia (i.e., isolated to one body part) versus a more generalized or
segmental dystonia [55,56]. Common non-surgical treatments for dystonia include botulinum toxin
injections, anticholinergic medications, and benzodiazepines.
DBS is a proven surgical treatment for dystonia refractory to medication and botulinum toxin
injections, particularly primary generalized dystonia (i.e., genetic or idiopathic) [5]. This treatment
received Humanitarian Device Exemption from the FDA in 2003. The primary target has been the GPi
in the majority of cases due to prior experience with lesioning therapies and the use of the target in the
PD population [57]. More recent DBS cases have used the STN target as well, most commonly with
focal cervical dystonia [5,58]. Some studies report up to a 60%–70% improvement on dystonia rating
scales in generalized dystonia post GPi DBS [5,58–61]. Results in focal dystonias are more variable.
The most common dystonia, cervical dystonia, does tend to have good response post DBS [62–64].
The responses to DBS in other types of focal or segmental dystonia are less well deﬁned and reported
less in the literature [5]. Post-surgical programming in this population can also often be challenging
compared to PD and ET. Unlike these movement disorders where stimulation results in immediate

45

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 46

clinical results, there is a long latency between programming adjustments and resulting clinical beneﬁt
that can be months in duration.
Like the other movement disorders already discussed, dystonia patients can have a suboptimal
response to DBS despite good lead positioning and a lack of detectable reversible complications such as
hardware malfunction or poor programming parameters [46,65]. Various techniques have been applied
in the dystonia population. A case series by Oyama et al. reported two patients who underwent rescue
lead placement for dystonia [46]. The ﬁrst was a patient with cervical dystonia who had incomplete
beneﬁt from bilateral GPi stimulation and underwent implantation of a second rescue lead into the
left GPi [46]. The rationale was that the patient’s original left GPi lead was 2.4 mm more anterior
than the right on repeat imaging. The second was a tardive dyskinesia/dystonia patient who had
incomplete beneﬁt from bilateral GPi stimulation and underwent implantation of bilateral STN rescue
leads two years later [46]. Both patients had complete symptom resolution with stimulation of both
the original and rescue leads [46]. In the ﬁrst case, the authors stimulated all contacts immediately
after the addition of the third lead with excellent results. In the second case, the authors attempted to
reduce GPi stimulation in favor of purely STN stimulation but only with activation of all four leads
did the patient achieve maximum beneﬁt. Beneﬁt was sustained at 17 months for the left GPi rescue
operation and 15 months for the bilateral STN rescue procedure at the time of publication [46].
No other case series were found that speciﬁcally addressed rescue leads for suboptimal DBS
results in dystonia. There was one report where bilateral STN DBS was used as a rescue procedure for
a failed unilateral pallidotomy [65]. Also, Schjerling et al. did perform a study directly comparing the
STN to the GPi as targets for dystonia [66]. Part of the study did address simultaneous stimulation of
the two targets. The study was a randomized, double-blind crossover study, and all patients received
both STN and GPi leads [66]. The study included 13 patients and was quite heterogeneous; ages ranged
from 12 to 57 years, disease duration ranged from 3 to 30 years, and it was roughly half generalized
and half focal dystonia [66]. While the results did not demonstrate a statistically signiﬁcant difference
between GPi and STN stimulation, there was a trend toward greatest improvement with simultaneous
stimulation of both targets, followed by STN alone and then GPi alone [66]. As with the single case
report mentioned above, there may be a role for simultaneous stimulation of the STN and GPi targets
in patients who have failed to achieve beneﬁcial results with a single target.
In summary, there is little available data regarding rescue lead implantation for dystonia patients.
In the one case report reviewed in addition to the study employing simultaneous GPi and STN
stimulation, the increased beneﬁt of combined STN and GPi stimulation is intriguing and could be
looked at more intensely in additional studies with larger populations. The published number of cases
is currently extremely limited. Studies of DBS in dystonia are complicated by the variety of clinical
presentations and underlying causes of dystonia. Studies are also complicated by the delay in beneﬁt
from stimulation which can take several months to manifest, if not longer. This makes programming
inherently difﬁcult as well as determining what qualiﬁes as a DBS failure.
5. Discussion and Conclusions
As described, published rescue procedures for failed DBS in PD, ET, and dystonia have been
performed with generally positive reported results and do have a role in cases of suboptimal DBS
outcomes. However, the data is still quite difﬁcult to apply to any general population for several
reasons. There is a high degree of individualization that takes place between institutions and patients
when it comes to such procedures. The amount of data is still very limited, and is currently entirely in
the form of case reports and series. Further, there is little incentive to write or publish case reports of
negative outcomes after rescue procedures, likely creating signiﬁcant publication bias.
Ultimately, more established guidelines, utilizing more concrete data, are needed for
performing rescue therapies in suboptimal DBS outcomes in each of the indications discussed.
However, a consensus set of guidelines based on better data from prospective blinded, randomized
clinical trials may be difﬁcult to achieve given the ethics of performing a blinded randomized trial

46

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 46

of a rescue surgical therapy as well as the multiple differing variables present in situations where
rescue leads are required. Nonetheless, with the uncertainty of the current data and the difﬁculty of
putting a patient through another surgery with poorly established outcomes, it is a given that rescue
procedures should only be performed as a last resort, after every attempt to optimize the current DBS
lead has been undertaken. Postoperative imaging should be performed to verify proper lead placement,
hardware checked to make sure its functioning appropriately, medications optimized to the fullest,
and programming adjustments exhausted as much as possible. There should be multidisciplinary
discussions between experienced DBS neurologists and neurosurgeons before undertaking these
procedures where targets and procedural options are discussed and weighed. The risks, ethics,
and potential emotional distress of putting patients and their families through another brain surgery
should never be taken lightly.
This review summarizes the available data on rescue therapies post DBS. More information and
experience from DBS centers, both good and bad, is needed to better establish future guidelines and
techniques. Still, available data does suggest that some patients can achieve beneﬁts with rescue
procedures. The decision to proceed with such treatment should be undertaken with caution and
involve open discussions with a team of DBS physicians, patients and their families, fully explaining
the uncertainty of results.

Abstract: Tremulous voice is characteristically associated with essential tremor, and is referred to
as essential vocal tremor (EVT). Current estimates suggest that up to 40% of individuals diagnosed
with essential tremor also present with EVT, which is associated with an impaired quality of
life. Traditional EVT treatments have demonstrated limited success in long-term management
of symptoms. However, voice tremor has been noted to decrease in patients receiving deep
brain stimulation (DBS) with the targeting of thalamic nuclei. In this study, we describe our
multidisciplinary procedure for awake, frameless DBS with optimal stimulation targets as well as
acoustic analysis and laryngoscopic assessment to quantify tremor reduction. Finally, we investigate
the most recent clinical evidence regarding the procedure.

1. Introduction
Tremulous voice is a distinguishing feature of many neurologic disorders including Parkinson’s
Disease (PD), stroke, orofacial dystonia, spasmodic dysphonia, myasthenia gravis, and progressive
supranuclear palsy [1–3]. Tremulous voice is characteristically associated with essential tremor (ET),
and is referred to as essential vocal tremor (EVT). EVT is thus a manifestation of the oscillatory
and rhythmic features of ET in the phonatory apparatus. Current estimates suggest that up to 40%
of individuals diagnosed with essential tremor also present with EVT [4]. EVT is characterized by
increased vocal effort, particularly during periods of anxiety or stress, causing signiﬁcant social
embarrassment. Patients with severe cases of EVT may feel obliged to reduce social commitments,
extricating themselves from employment and hobbies. Though discernable in many forms of vocal
interaction, irregularities are most noticeable with sustained phonation of vowels. Thus, EVT may
signiﬁcantly impair quality of life, and patients are in need of a durable solution [5].
Tremulous voice is a symptom of laryngeal tremor. The antagonistic contractions of pharyngeal,
laryngeal, and/or palatal muscles cause rhythmic oscillations of the laryngeal apparatus at a rate of
4–8 Hz in EVT patients. Such oscillations alter voice pitch and intensity, corresponding to acoustic
changes in fundamental frequency (f 0 ) and amplitude, respectively [5]. Symptoms may be exacerbated
by involuntary movements of vocal accessory muscles such as chest wall muscles, abdominal muscles,
and the diaphragm. Regularity and intensity of acoustic changes are subject to considerable variability
between EVT patients [6].

2. Patient Evaluation/Assessment of EVT
The multidisciplinary outpatient evaluation of EVT includes an otolaryngologist specialized
in voice disorders as well as a speech language pathologist. Patients will present with debilitating,
progressive vocal tremor that is refractory to medication and causing a signiﬁcant reduction in quality
of life. Other tremors such as head or upper extremity tremor may also be present.
If the patient should present de novo to the neurosurgeon for consideration of deep brain
stimulation (DBS) for tremor, normal preoperative DBS work-up and clearance should be completed.
The patient must also consult a laryngologist and speech language pathologist for a full tremor
work-up. Diagnosis and characterization of EVT is performed by a laryngologist with ﬁberoptic
nasolaryngoscopic examination of the pharynx and larynx, also known as ﬂexible distal-chip
laryngoscopy, during tasks that emphasize prolonged phonation [5]. The preoperative examination by
the speech language pathologist serves to characterize instrumental and acoustic qualities of the vocal
tremor, to develop behavioral strategies for patients to reduce phonatory collision forces at the region
of identiﬁed pathology. These objective measures also establish a baseline from which to measure
intra- and postoperative alterations in voice with DBS [6].
Additional, objective acoustic measures may concomitantly be used to assist with diagnosis [7].
Though transnasal and oral endoscopic approaches are used in EVT diagnosis, the transnasal approach
is preferred since it permits a more thorough investigation of the musculature while keeping the
patient in a natural posture. Laryngeal tremor may be diagnosed on transnasal endoscopy upon
identiﬁcation of characteristic rhythmic oscillations of the vocal folds during speech. This rhythmic
oscillation may be complemented with craniocaudal laryngeal oscillations and/or contractions of the
palate as well as the pharynx. Tremor is noticeable both on prolonged vowel phonation as well as
during quiet respiration [5,8].
An acoustical examination, comprised of sustained and short sentences as well as sustained vowel
sounds, should be utilized to supplement ﬁndings and conclusions drawn from a direct laryngeal
exam [9]. During the evaluation, it is essential that the patient sustain phonation of vowels since
connected speech may conceal the presence or severity of EVT. The rates of f 0 and intensity change
are measured, recorded, and used to describe the acoustic characteristics of EVT. Changes in these
two rate parameters are typically synchronous, and are the most noticeable features of vocal tremor.
Additionally, the magnitude of change in intensity and f 0 may also be utilized in describing EVT
acoustic characteristics. Magnitude values are determined by calculating the ranges of both intensity
and f 0 oscillations. High voice intensity is characteristic of an ET patient, and successful intervention
will likely result in a reduction [10]. Investigation of other acoustic measures such as shimmer, jitter,
and harmonic-to-noise ratio, speech rate (syllables per second), and voice aerodynamics (e.g., s-to-z
ratio and maximum phonation time) may also be used to preoperatively evaluate patients or assess
vocal changes [7]. EVT patients experience increases in shimmer and jitter, as well as a reduction in
harmonic-to-noise ratio (voice quality), s-to-z ratio, and maximum phonation time. Therefore, a shift in
these parameters can signify reduction of ET symptoms and may be used as markers to verify accurate
lead and electrode placement in vocal tremor patients.
3. Treatment of EVT
Traditional EVT treatments have demonstrated limited success in long-term management of
symptoms. First-line pharmacologic treatment with agents such as primidone and propranolol yield
varied outcomes [11]. Alternatively, EVT patients whose tremor originates in the thryroarytenoid and
extralaryngeal muscles have received targeted injections of Botulinum A toxin (Botox). Such targeted
Botox therapies have demonstrated a signiﬁcant reduction in tremor amplitude in up to 80% of this
subset of patients [12]. However, it should be noted that patients rarely experience complete tremor
resolution, despite the transient nature of this treatment and need for periodic injections over the
patient’s lifetime. Botox injections may also present with adverse effects including dysphagia, coughing,
choking, and breathiness. This side effect profile limits use of the treatment in elderly patients [13].
52

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 48

Currently, there are promising avenues for behavioral modiﬁcation treatment by working with
a speech language pathologist [6]. However, it is evident that an enduring and effective treatment for
EVT is required.
4. DBS for EVT
Despite shortcomings of pharmacological and behavioral treatments for EVT, Deep Brain
Stimulation (DBS) is known to be a safe and reputed method of reducing nonspeciﬁc tremor severity
for patients who are refractory to medication [7]. However, there remains little research or evidence in
the literature that has systematically investigated symptom improvement EVT upon DBS intervention,
and many laryngologists remain under-informed regarding the therapeutic potential of DBS [3].
In 2002, Sataloff et al. reported the ﬁrst case report for the application of DBS in treating vocal
tremor [14]. The study examined two patients who were implanted with stimulators bilaterally in
the ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim) of the thalamus. Voice analysis and strobovideolaryngoscopy
revealed elimination of symptoms in one patient and signiﬁcant decrease in voice tremor in the
other [14]. Most studies since that time are comprised of results from small number of participants or
are in the form of case reports [15–19].
Voice tremor has been noted to decrease in patients receiving DBS treatment for other indications
including dystonia, essential hand tremor, and PD-associated tremor due to the targeting of nearby
thalamic nuclei [2,15,20]. For example, DBS targeting the STN for treatment of PD demonstrates
improvement in voice tremor symptoms, albeit inconsistent [2]. Patients without Vim targeting did
not experience as great a reduction in voice tremor as other regions with tremor [15,16,21].
Of note, patient eligibility and selection should account for potential worsening of gait especially
following bilateral Vim DBS implantation, as noted in certain studies [21]. However, gait imbalances
can be partially or fully resolved with reprogramming.
5. Vim Target for DBS
In 1987, Benabid et al. was ﬁrst to suggest that tremor symptoms could be alleviated by stimulating
the Vim region of the thalamus [22]. The Vim is organized in a somatotopic fashion, with cerebellar
afferents from the face positioned most medially, and progressing to hands then feet, laterally. Since the
precise location of Vim may be difﬁcult to discern on, microelectrode recording and stereotactic
referencing are utilized for physiological mapping and indirect targeting, respectively. The coordinates
of the Vim are different for each individual, but as a general rule, direct Vim targeting proceeds 6 mm
posterior to the midpoint of the anterior commissure-posterior commissure (AC-PC) and 12–14 mm
lateral to the AC-PC line [7]. Microelectrode unit activation occurs more frequently with passive
kinesthetic movement of extremity joints, as it passes from the skull entry point caudally to the Vim.
Receptive ﬁelds in the thalamus are arranged in a somatotopic map with ﬁelds corresponding
to the face located medially, upper extremity located ventromedially, and lower extremity located
dorsolaterally. As the electrode descends in the customary dorsolateral-to-ventromedial track into the
Vim, it will pass leg and subsequently arm kinesthetic receptive ﬁelds [6]. Therefore, suppression of
voice tremor is contingent on stimulator positioning 1–2 mm medial the typical essential tremor (ET)
target [23,24].
Since vocal tremor must be continually monitored by a speech language pathologist, surgery is
always conducted in the awake state. Tremor can be monitored in regions associated with vocal tremor
and which demonstrate tremor symptoms, such as the head and limbs. Before electrode insertion,
depth of the target in the Vim is determined. The microelectrode is initially set to a point 15 mm
proximal to the target to test and conﬁrm its impedance range.
The microelectrode is then moved incrementally towards the target, while continuously recording.
Single unit recordings when the electrode passes through the thalamus are typically excellent.
As the electrode nears the target, macrostimulation is accompanied by meticulous documentation
of tremor reduction and careful monitoring for paresthesias. A neurophysiologist will help record

53

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 48

kinesthetic responses the corresponding extremity, proximal motor groups, and macrostimulation via
the microcannula. Additionally, a speech language pathologist will perform both an intraoperative
acoustic assessment and a speech assessment for the patient.
Accuracy in electrode implantation at an appropriate distance from certain nuclei is contingent
on proper identiﬁcation of surrounding structures. Slightly anterior to the Vim are the ventrooralis
posterior and anterior nuclei, which are activated by movement of the contralateral extremities.
By contrast, the ventral caudalis nucleus is located posteriorly to the Vim. It can be distinguished
from the Vim as it contains a narrow somatotopic area of receptive ﬁelds reacting to light touch [25].
Electrode implantation is considered safe if it is sufﬁciently far from the ventral caudalis nucleus
(>2 mm). In ET patients, the DBS electrode is usually targeted to the kinesthetic ﬁelds, which are linked
to the hands. Successful or near-complete tremor suppression will require macroelectrode stimulation
with currents as low as 0.2 mA and microelectrode stimulation with currents up to 100 microAmps.
If the electrode is implanted distally from the Vim and proximally to the ventral caudalis nucleus,
the patient will experience paresthesia in place of tremor suppression. Thus, successful stimulation
will manifest as decreased tremor without any sustained sensation of paresthesia [26].
Following successful electrode insertion and veriﬁcation with macrostimulation and
microrecording, the lead should be implanted utilizing the same track. Optimal placement of the
electrode will necessitate several passes, introducing a possibility of morbidity. Upon observation
of tremor reduction, a Medtronic 3389 DBS electrode, sized to the correct length, may be relayed
to the target point along the track. Following test simulations that conﬁrm tremor reduction and
rule out the presence of harmful side effects, the lead is secured. This entire process is repeated
in the contralateral side for bilateral tremor patients. After one week, the patient returns to have
a pulse generator implanted infraclavicularly. Two weeks post-implantation, the patient returns for
a programming visit, and will also receive both speech and neurophysiologic analysis.
6. Discussion
EVT is a type of tremulous voice disorder that is highly refractory to treatment, and results
in signiﬁcantly compromised quality of life for patients. Though a decade has passed since DBS
had been hypothesized as a therapeutic avenue for patients with EVT, the literature remains
sparse with respect to systematic studies. DBS has been proposed as a more permanent treatment
modality for EVT patients, but few comprehensive studies exist in the literature investigating DBS
use for this particular indication. The ﬁrst of these studies was performed by Sataloff et al. and
utilized objective voice analysis and strobovideolaryngoscopy to evaluate patient outcomes. Both
patients in the study experienced signiﬁcant reductions in vocal tremor, with one patient emerging
symptom-free after treatment [14]. Most other studies examining DBS-induced vocal tremor reduction
feature patients with an assortment of other pathologies and utilization of differing techniques of
intervention [15,16,18,21,27]. Additionally, tremor assessments are not complete and often contain
varied time intervals during which recordings were made. Furthermore, qualitative assessment
protocols introduce variation between stimulator settings, resulting in more variation in methodology.
Moreover, certain tremor evaluations conducted alone, such as subjective speech evaluations without
any other examination, have little reliability [7].
In this article, we aim to provide a detailed account of the comprehensive and multidisciplinary
use of awake, frameless DBS in treating EVT, beginning with the pre-operative evaluation.
Characteristic features of our procedure include designation of the Vim as the neurophysiological target
and utilization of real-time physiologic feedback to track changes in vocal tremor while in the operating
room. Utilization of a frameless system provides added beneﬁts in comparison to the stereotactic frame
equivalent, including ease of intraoperative neurological examinations, improved patient comfort,
greater accuracy, as well as real-time electrode tracking by synthesizing multiple information sources.
These beneﬁts are demonstrated in the clinical setting without compromising either stability or
accuracy [28].

54

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 48

Notably, our procedure is successful in reducing symptoms of EVT without minimizing the
positive effects of DBS on tremor in the concurrent extremities. DBS intervention results in an increased
harmonic-to-noise ratio (improved voice quality) and decreased f 0 [7]. More investigation is required to
uncover the prime electrode targets to concurrently treat multiple tremor types. Moreover, Vogel et al.
found that optimal stimulator settings, including the Pitch Floors/Ceilings and Time Steps, are superior
in function when compared to baseline, clinical settings [7]. However, we believe that this effort will
help inﬂuence and inspire the development of new treatments for this previously refractory group
of patients.
Despite their limitations, these studies exhibit positive results of DBS treatment, including
decreases in both tremor severity and the rate of F0 modulation [6,15]. It is imperative that further
prospective investigations are conducted to validate the positive effects of DBS in EVT patients.
Furthermore, it is important to distinguish the difference between successful tremor reduction and
speech outcomes. While DBS has demonstrated promise and consistent success in reducing tremor,
the correlation between tremor decrease and speech improvement is unclear [7,29]. A recent study
examining the use of DBS for EVT in a different brain region found that vocal tremor treatment
signiﬁcantly reduced symptoms in only half of the patient cohort [30]. This suggests the possibility of
vocal tremor symptoms that originate in other parts of the body, from sources outside of the direct
phonatory apparatus. Hence, careful evaluation of the source of tremor by a trained otolaryngologist
is essential.
Future studies should incorporate larger patient cohorts studied over long periods of time in
order to truly examine efﬁcacy and complications of DBS as a treatment for vocal tremor. The focal,
reportable metric in these studies will be a complete voice and larynx examination pre-, intra-,
and post-operatively, which will help in the production of evidence-based guidelines. This examination
should incorporate nasal endoscopy for direct laryngeal visualization as well as vocal analysis, such as
aerodynamics, review by both patient and physician, and acoustics. Results from such studies will
have the potential to shape future therapies for this group of medication-refractory patients.
7. Conclusions
In this study, we describe our multidisciplinary procedure for awake, frameless DBS with
optimal stimulation targets as well as acoustic analysis and laryngoscopic assessment to quantify
tremor reduction.

Abstract: Huntington’s disease (HD) is one of the most disabling degenerative movement disorders,
as it not only affects the motor system but also leads to cognitive disabilities and psychiatric symptoms.
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the pallidum is a promising symptomatic treatment targeting the core
motor symptom: chorea. This article gives an overview of preliminary evidence on pathophysiology,
safety and efﬁcacy of DBS in HD.
Keywords: chorea; Huntington; deep brain stimulation; DBS; safety pathophysiology; recordings;

1. Introduction
In this manuscript, the authors update a recent perspective article on brain stimulation in
Huntington’s disease (HD), [1] focusing especially on deep brain stimulation (DBS) and its preliminary
evidence on safety and efﬁcacy.
HD is an autosomal dominant inherited neurodegenerative disorder [2]. As a consequence of an
expanded CAG repeat in the HD gene motor symptoms, psychiatric symptoms and cognitive decline
progressively develop. Even though cellular pathology is evident in the whole body, medium spiny
neurons in the circumscribed area of the striatum are considered to selectively degenerate in the course
of HD and thereby lead to motor symptoms [3], typically including chorea, dystonia and bradykinesia.
Especially, choreatic symptoms commonly occur in early stages of HD [4]. Here, the disinhibition of one
basal ganglia network circuit is considered to be pivotal [4]. Degeneration of striatal neurons, which
project to the indirect pathway of the basal ganglia circuit, cause decreased basal ganglia output [5]
and the aforementioned disinhibition. Furthermore, pathological changes in the direct pathway of the
basal ganglia circuit have to be taken into account. Structural alterations in the substantia nigra and
the cerebellum could also play a crucial role in dystonic or hypokinetic-rigid symptoms [6,7].
The status quo in HD treatment has offered no approved neuroprotective or causal treatment so
far. As a consequence, the therapeutic options for HD rely on symptom treatment, which often is not
sufﬁciently effective or causes side effects.

2. Evolution of Deep Brain Stimulation for HD
Chronic electric stimulation of deep brain structures (see Figure 1) is a well-established therapeutic
method using stereotactic techniques to pinpoint the target regions of interest, such as certain
parts of the basal ganglia network [8,9]. In 1987, Benabid and colleagues paved the way for the
broader DBS application with an implanted impulse generator in different movement disorders and
other disorders in the ﬁeld of neurology and psychiatry [10]. Previous to this, DBS predominantly
was (sometimes abusively) proposed for psychiatric disorders [11–13]. Subsequent DBS ﬁndings
in movement disorders such as tremor and dystonia however indicated the ﬁrst beneﬁts for
patients [14–16]. The underlying mechanisms of DBS are still not sufﬁciently identiﬁed and therefore
the extensive current assumptions about DBS functional principles are discussed elsewhere in more
detail [17,18].

stereotactically implanted stimulation electrodes. Image provided by Medtronic.

In short, underlying mechanisms include local and network-wide effects and might even range
to neuroprotective and neurogenesis effects, even though evidence is preliminary here. While high
frequency stimulation seems to mimic a lesion in the targeted area [19,20], the frequency of the action’s
potential output in this certain region increases [18]. Therefore, no one uniﬁed mechanism such as the
inhibition of neuronal activity can explain the DBS overall effect on the region of interest. A dissociation
between the somatic and axonal activity of the neurons may explain these contradicting patterns.
As a consequence of different thresholds for somatic and axonal neuronal activity, DBS might inhibit
the soma near to the stimulated electrode, but activate axons and dendrites in the stimulated area,
which results in an increase of the action potential output frequency [18]. Notwithstanding, these
inhibition and activation effects are merely two out of several mechanisms contributing to the impact
of DBS.
The overall effect of DBS in the globus pallidus internus (GPi) is beneficial to hyperkinetic
movement disorders like dyskinesia in Parkinson’s disease (PD) [21,22], primary dystonia [23,24],
tardive dyskinesia [25,26] and other disorders like neurodegeneration with Brain Iron Accumulation [27],
chorea-akanthocytosis [28,29] or dystonia–choreoathetosis in cerebral palsy [30–32]. As an alternative
method to pallidotomy as a treatment option for HD, DBS (especially of the GPI) has been of growing
interest during the last 12 years [33,34].

3. Invasive Assessment of the Basal Ganglia Network in HD
The disruption of the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) networks is assumed to be the
underlying functional mechanism of HD and presumably is linked to cellular degeneration [35].
Three parallel arranged circuits—an associative, motor and limbic circuit—can be distinguished [36].
Due to the evolution of the three systems, a functional segregation of these networks is assumed.
Nevertheless, a shared hierarchic CSTC-architecture can be found (see Figure 2): Cortical glutamatergic
projections reach the associative striatal areas, from where a direct and an indirect pathway reach the
output nuclei of the basal ganglia system [37]. The direct pathway comprises the following circuit:
Distinct neurons of the associative striatal areas project via inhibitory (GABA-ergic) transmission
to output nuclei of the basal ganglia system [38], which connects again via GABA-ergic projections
to certain parts of the thalamus, that eventually indicate glutamatergic efferents to cortical areas.
Depending on the certain function of a circuit the involved anatomical structures of striatum, output
nuclei, and thalamic nuclei vary, e.g., the motor circuit involves the putamen, GPi and the anterior
ventral thalamic nucleus. On the other hand, the indirect pathway comprises different stations: either
it solely passes the globus pallidus externus (GPe; GABA-ergic) or the indirect pathway reaches
the output nuclei by transversing both the GPe and subthalamic nucleus (STN, glutamatergic) [38].
The loss of striatal neurons, which reach the GPe within the “indirect pathway”, is characteristic and
probably pivotal in early stages of HD [39,40]. The consequences are, ﬁrstly, the relatively overactive
GPe, secondly, the increased inhibition of the STN [41,42], thirdly, the suppression of the output nuclei
and, eventually, the disinhibition of thalamic nuclei. Hence, the loss of striatal neurons results in a
thalamic overactivity. Choreatic movements derive from the increased thalamic output in the basal
ganglia motor loop. In contrast to this, early cognitive impairment, e.g., the inhibition of error control,
may arise from the impairment of the associative CSTC circuit [43]. With respect to an affection of
the third basal ganglia loop, i.e., the limbic circuit, ﬁndings suggest altered affectivity in HD, such as
agitation, irritability, anxiety, or euphoria [44]. As HD progresses, alteration of striatal efferents of the
direct pathway play a more signiﬁcant role. Concurrently, hyperkinetic-rigid symptoms aggravate
at the expense of initial choreatic symptoms, so that this shift of symptoms could relate to the direct
pathway affection [45]. The assumption of open connections between the different circuits is an
additional concept to the aforementioned closed loop projections. This concept facilitates interaction at
different hierarchical levels of the CSTC network [46] such as directional input from the associative
CSTC circuit to both the motor and limbic loops. Findings in histology as well as in morphometry
indicate an early affection of the associative CSTC loop. Assuming a (relative) functional integrity of
the three main CSTC circuits, the idea of an open connection between those offers an explanation for
the motor and limbic symptoms, which manifest subsequently [46].

indicate excitatory connections.

Prior to the implantation of the DBS electrodes, one method to determine the precise, circumscribed
target position is the invasive electrical recording of multi-unit recordings of action potentials.
On the other hand, these microelectrode recordings are also useful in the research of dysfunctional
electrophysiological processes in e.g., movement disorders [47]. As such, they serve to uncover
circumscribed characteristic neuronal patterns. The comparison of invasive electrical recordings without
sedation between PD and idiopathic dystonia indicates disease-specific pallidal activation patterns.
While the measured average GPe discharge rates for dystonia and for PD are almost identical (~55 Hz),
both diseases differ distinctly in the GPi discharge rates (PD ~95 Hz, Dystonia ~55 Hz) [48]. Findings of
invasive electrical recordings in HD patients are comparatively scarce up to now. Heterogeneous study
conditions and populations (such as anesthesia or disease type) result in divergent neuronal firing
patterns [34,49]. In contrast to the first published study of HD GPi firing patterns, which investigates
one juvenile HD patient under general sedation [34], later studies also focus on discharge rates in
non-anesthetized patients [49,50]. In terms of the discharge rate, the findings are inconsistent: While the
neurons in the GP indicate a dorsoventral (GPe to GPi) gradient in their discharge rate in DBS surgery
in one awake HD patient (~51 to ~73 Hz) [50]. In two non-anaesthetized patients with severe HD,
the firing rate of GPi was almost identical to PD: above 80 Hz [49]. Findings with anesthesia [34,51]
indicate slower firing of the GPi, around and below 20 Hz, as the use of sedatives is a decisive factor
suppressing the discharge rate.
Another method for the electrophysiological characterization of neural networks is the assessment
of oscillatory activity via local ﬁeld potentials (LFP), which reﬂect synchronized activity of neural
clusters in the vicinity of the recording electrode. The analysis of LFP oscillations s by Starr et al.
revealed less synchronized neuronal activity in the surrounding of the electrode for the 2–35 Hz
frequency range in resting, non-anesthetized HD patients in contrast to PD patients [50]. In another
study of one HD patient without sedation from our own group, LFP recordings indicate dorsoventral
gradients in the target area [52]. While approaching the GPi center, the power increases in the
alpha-theta range (4–12 Hz). We concluded that this alpha-theta dominance could reﬂect a general
characteristic of unvoluntary movements due to corresponding ﬁndings in other diseases such as
dystonia, levodopa-induced dyskinesia and Tourette’s syndrome. Furthermore, our group observed an
even more evident dorsoventral gradient for the low gamma range (35–45 Hz), which intensiﬁed when

61

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 38

reaching the GPi ventral border. This dorsoventral gradient was considered as crucial pathophysiology
for exaggerated motor drive [52].
4. Clinical Implications of DBS in HD
4.1. Clinical Implications of DBS on Hyperkinetic and Hypokinetic Symptoms
To date, there is only one prospective randomized, double-blind study on the impact of DBS on
HD symptoms [53]. Two HD patients with juvenile onset (Westphal variant) and four HD patients
with later onset underwent pallidal DBS. Dystonic and bradykinetic symptoms predominated in the
Westphal patients, while chorea symptoms were more pronounced in the HD patients with adult onset.
In contrast to the two Westphal HD patients, the four other patients could proﬁt extensively from
pallidal (GPi or GPe) DBS, as the choreatic symptoms signiﬁcantly decreased by 60% compared to
symptoms’ baseline within the six month DBS treatment. The 60% reduction in choreatic symptoms
derives from the acquisition of the UHDRS chorea subscore (Uniﬁed Huntington Disease Rating Scale)
at baseline and six months after surgery. Although not signiﬁcant over group, in three out of four
non-Westphal patients, marked improvement of dystonia could be observed. In another study with
seven HD patients, the 60% reduction in choreatic symptoms could even been measured by the UHDRS
one year after implantation [54]. Tables 1 and 2 illustrate case reports and series with distinct chorea
symptom reduction. A total number of 36 patients are reported. As a meta-analysis, chorea reduction
can be estimated at around 56%, whereas improvement of Dystonia (scores available from 20 patients)
is minor (1%).

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 38

In one patient with four implanted electrodes in the bilateral GPi and STN, solely STN DBS
failed to reduce the chorea symptoms [65]. On the other hand, STN DBS could play a major role
for hypokinesia, as GPi DBS side effects of increased hypokinetic symptoms could be reduced with
additional STN DBS in one HD patient [65]. DBS of the GPi seems to cause these hypokinetic side
effects such as gait disturbances [69–71] and of more pronounced bradykinesia [54,55,64,67]. As a
meta-analysis from available bradykinesia-scores in 17 from 36 HD patients, the impairment by
GP-DBS is minor (around 3%).
Thus, the few ﬁndings in HD patients with DBS on hyperkinetic symptoms of dystonia and
hypokinetic symptoms of bradykinesia do not admit an unambiguous recommendation for the
stimulation of the pallidum. Beneﬁcial therapeutic effects of well-established pallidal DBS on primary
dystonia cannot be transferred to the impact on dystonic symptoms in HD. The few existing studies
suggest pallidal DBS to be beneﬁcial [72] or ineffective [54] or negatively impacting [63] on the dystonic
symptoms. These heterogeneous ﬁndings are also supported in our prospective trial [53] and the above
mentioned meta-analysis. Due to the small amount of case reports here, individual pathophysiology
could contribute to those contradicting, inconsistent ﬁndings of pallidal DBS on dystonic symptoms
of HD. Furthermore, depending on the stimulated area of the pallidum, opposite motor effects are
known [21].
In terms of unwanted effects, a lower frequency stimulation of 40 Hz could be superior to a
higher frequency stimulation of 130 Hz, as choreatic symptoms ameliorated in the same amount
under both stimulation frequencies, but hypokinetic symptoms only became less pronounced under
the 40 Hz stimulation in three case reports [52,55,58]. Nevertheless, those preliminary results of only
three patients have to be interpreted with caution as the overall ﬁndings on the optimal stimulation
frequency for minimal side effects are inconsistent: High frequency stimulation of more than 100 Hz
does not always lead to a worsening of induced hypokinesia [57,60] and DBS of approximately 40 Hz
does not always result in a reduction of those hypokinetic symptoms [67,68]. Along with the optimal
stimulation area, the precise, most beneﬁcial stimulation frequency is of particular interest for the
clinical treatment. According to the few, preliminary existing ﬁndings, chorea tends to be suppressed
more with higher frequency stimulation compared to lower frequency stimulation. High frequencies
of 130 Hz are mostly applied in treatment studies of HD chorea symptoms and, according to some
ﬁndings, the beneﬁts even increase when using 180 Hz frequencies [57,67,72].
4.2. Clinical Implications of DBS on Non-Motor-Functions
Prior to the HD diagnosis based on motoric symptoms, cognitive abilities can decline.
Simultaneously, striking physiological changes such as cerebral atrophy become evident [73].
Various cognitive domains such as processing speed, working memory and attention can be affected
and the cognitive impairment is progressive in the course of the HD [74]. Deﬁcits in error feedback
control mechanisms are regarded as a key problem for cognitive but also motor malfunctions.
The improvement of the early cognitive deﬁcits by DBS would contribute to therapeutic treatment,
but also to an understanding of physiological dysfunctional mechanisms, as cognitive conspicuities
precede motor symptoms [75,76]. In early HD stages, the striatal neurons projecting to the GPe
predominantly degenerate, thus positing a major role of the GPe for the cognitive deﬁcits in HD.
As such, Ayalon et al. lesioned different parts of the indirect pathway in rats and their results
suggest the GPe in primates as a valuable stimulation area to treat cognitive in addition to motor
symptoms [77]. Another study sheds light on the cognitive ability of response inhibition in the
ﬁrst transgenic HD rat model. The primate GPe equivalent in rats was stimulated and effectively
improved the deﬁcits in the response inhibition [78]. Findings in humans by our own group might
point in the same direction, as pallidal DBS in HD patients with preponderant choreatic symptoms
over six months was followed by a stable level in cognitive abilities instead of a progressive decline
in cognition. Results were slightly, but not signiﬁcantly better in the GPe-DBS group than in the
GPi-DBS group in terms of cognitive effects. This could suggest that pallidal DBS in HD slows down

65

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 38

progressive cognitive decline and keeps cognitive abilities on a stable level to some extent [53]. In a
recent DBS imaging study, stimulation of the GPe was highlighted with respect to cognitive networks.
Nevertheless, this study lacks cognitive tests in order to validate the imaging data [79]. In another
experimental study, GPe-DBS had beneﬁcial effects on cognitive control and, here, behavioral as
well as electrophysiological data were collected for identiﬁcation of cognitive effects. Two patients
performed an error monitoring task ON and OFF GPe-stimulation: A ﬂanker paradigm was applied to
investigate adaptive behavior in response to committed errors. Error-related-behavioral adaptation
was compared via the error-related-negativity (ERN) and the post error slowing in the DBS and
control group. In addition to this, general response monitoring was measured via the correct-related
negativity (CRN/Nc) amplitude for both groups. The ﬁndings suggest that GP-DBS positively impacts
both aspects, the adaptive behavior as a response to error processing and also the general response
monitoring. Smaller ERN, less pronounced post-error-slowing and less pronounced Nc could be
observed in manifest HD patients OFF DBS, but their behavioral and electrophysiological measures
aligned with the healthy control group when GPe DBS was applied [80]. These are promising ﬁndings,
which highlight the GPe as a valuable DBS target and suggest cognitive beneﬁts. However, it has to be
noted that up to date no placebo-controlled prospective clinical data on GPe-DBS is available. On the
other hand, DBS stimulation of the GPi led to far more inconsistent effects, up to now. The effects
of GPi-DBS on patients cognition range from a progressive decline similar to non-stimulated HD
patients [58,61,67] to stable cognitive functions for at least 4 years [59] and even to alleviation in
distinct cognitive abilities [62,68]. Various causes have been discussed for the numerous observed
effects of GPi-DBS. According to animal-based ﬁndings and studies with humans, it is suggested that
GPi-DBS treatment beneﬁts on cognition could derive from electric ﬁelds in the GPi, which extend
to the GPe. Evidence on other non-motor functions and quality-of life (QoL) is sparse up to date.
Existing data from the prospective protocol might suggest some improvement of sub-scales of QoL
and depression [70].
5. Safety of DBS in HD
In our executed pilot study, the implantation of the DBS electrodes into the GP proved to be a
safe procedure and lacked procedure-related side effects. However, these preliminary data have to
be treated with caution as they included only six HD patients [53]. Nevertheless, this pilot study is
the only one available up to date with a prospective design, which corresponds to the CONSORT
criteria with adverse events (AE) entirely reported by using an independent data and safety monitoring
board (DSMB). Besides the side effects described in Sections 4.1 and 4.2, here we focus on the formal
safety report of the prospective trial. One might anticipate that DBS causes three main types of
adverse device effects (ADE): (1) transient due to electrical stimulation; (2) transient due to technical
problems/complication/infections and, ﬁnally, (3) transient or permanent due to implantation
complications. Concerning all types of AE including ADE, the data from our pilot trial showed
the following: AEs that where actually reported within 6 months: eight adverse events were recorded.
All AE resolved without sequelae. AEs unrelated to stimulation but possibly due to hospitalization:
thrombophlebitis, MRSA nose infection, superﬁcial nose abrasion. AEs related to treatment—thus
ADE—were: possibly related to stimulation (Type 1 ADE, exclusively reported with GPi- but not
GPe- stimulation): bradykinesia, hyperthermia, gait impairment, increased chorea and possibly
related to stimulation system: deactivation of impulse generator (Type 2 ADE). In addition, two
serious adverse events (SAE) were reported: gait impairment and hyperkinesia after reprogramming
(SAE criterion: leading to hospital admission and requiring reprogramming) and postoperative
malignant hyperthermia possibly related to stimulation (SAE criterion: life-threatening and leading
to prolonged hospital stay). Both SAE were judged as SADE (Serious Adverse Device Effects) with
Type 1. No procedure-related complication or bleeding occurred (Type 3 ADE). In the prospective trial,
no side effects on cognition and mood were present.

6. Outlook
Preliminary ﬁndings in HD patients reveal overall positive effects of pallidal stimulation on chorea.
Beside the motor effect on chorea by GPi-stimulation, the presumably better effect-side-effect ratio and
the promising ﬁndings of GPe-DBS for cognition ought to be further validated. The GPi/GPe border
zone might be a suitable target for DBS. One evident difﬁculty is the progressive atrophy of the GP
which might prevent the precise identiﬁcation of distinct pallidal parts. On the other hand, the atrophic
altered GP might lead to the unintended impairment of areas in the surroundings of the target site
and thereby provoke unwanted side effects as a consequence of DBS surgery. To overcome these
aspects, technical advanced stimulation programming can be used. To identify an optimal treatment
of motor symptoms, a systematic investigation of the stimulation frequency is needed, as chorea and
bradykinesia treatments were shown to have different, opposing optimal stimulation frequencies.
Another further step ought to systemically study the DBS pulse width. As a standard, 60–450 μs were
implemented in most cases and, up to now, not much attention has been paid to variations of the
pulse width [59,60]. However, an optimal pulse width could warrant larger therapeutic windows
and might avoid side effects, as revealed by studies of STN DBS in parkinsonism, in which 30 μs
was beneﬁcial [81,82]. Furthermore, the newest DBS devices allow new possibilities concerning pulse
width, current steering and directional stimulation [83,84]. The most beneﬁcial treatment approach
of direct DBS in HD might be attained by identifying the optimal parameters corresponding to the
predominating symptoms in each individual. Optimal stimulation programs could also be achieved by
algorithms and models taking into account the volume of tissue active (VTA) and tailored parameters
automatically based on anticipated side effects (see Figure 3).

and volume of tissue activated (VTA, in red) in relation to the pallidum (in brown). Image source:
authors’ own contribution.

Moreover, sensing neurostimulators will be valuable devices in therapeutic treatment and research.
However, contrary to other movement disorders [85], as stated in Section 3, LFP recording data as a
possible biomarker in HD is sparse up to date.
In order to create a higher level of evidence for DBS in HD, the next major step is a prospective,
randomized, double blind, parallel group, sham-controlled, multi-center (MC) superiority trial which
is currently recruiting in Europe (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02535884). Based on the evidence outlined in
this review article, the ongoing MC-randomized controlled trial is focusing on the efﬁcacy of GP-DBS

67

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 38

on chorea as a primary endpoint while considering several motor functions such as dystonia and
bradykinesia, cognition, mood and quality of life as secondary endpoints. Patients with predominant
chorea despite best medical treatment (UHDRS chorea sub score ≥ 10) with only minor cognitive
and psychiatric disturbances are selected. Postural instability is considered as exclusion criteria for
DBS. In terms of risk management, based on the preliminary data, the HD cohort does not seem to be
at special risk due to DBS when all inclusion/exclusion criteria of patients are carefully addressed.
This assumption is based on the data with three Type 1 and one Type 2 ADE and no Type 3 ADE in the
pilot data [70]. For the most serious Type 3 complications, we propose the following risk stratiﬁcation:
Risk of brain bleeding is stratiﬁed with grade of brain atrophy:
(1)
(2)
(3)

No signiﬁcant atrophy;
Mild cortical atrophy as common in neurodegenerative disorders;
Severe cortical atrophy and additional atrophy periventricular and of the target basal
ganglia structures.

Grade 1 atrophy is not expected in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s and
Huntington’s disease. Grade 2 is common in these diseases and results in a risk of bleeding of
(5%–7%) during implantation [86]. As Grade 3 atrophy makes a surgical approach more difﬁcult
due to the atrophy of the target area, it is assumed that these patients have higher operative risks.
However, no systematic data on these patients is available. Grade 3 atrophy is more common in HD
patients at moderate stages than in PD patients. Thus, these patients are excluded in order to keep
the implantation risk at the level of PD of 5%–7%. Thus, due to the mentioned risk assessment and
calculation, it is assumed that the implantation risk in HD patients with brain atrophy Grade 2 is at the
level of already approved and CE marked indication of DBS.
7. Conclusions
There is preliminary evidence for the usefulness of pallidal DBS for chorea suppression in HD
from a number of cases, case series and smaller trials (with fewer than 10 patients per trial) and from
one prospective randomized, double-blinded trial lacking a placebo control group. DBS procedure
was demonstrated to be a safe treatment option in the above mentioned trial. Cognitive functions
might beneﬁt from stimulation of the external part of the pallidum. Up to date, DBS effects on chorea
and other motor symptoms such as dystonia and on QoL are examined in a larger and placebo
(OFF-stimulation) controlled trial.

Abstract: Objective: To answer the question of whether the anatomical center of the subthalamic
nucleus (STN), as calculated indirectly from stereotactic atlases or by direct visualization on magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), corresponds to the best functional target. Since the neighboring red nucleus
(RN) is well visualized on MRI, we studied the relationships of the ﬁnal target to its different borders.
Methods: We analyzed the data of 23 PD patients (46 targets) who underwent bilateral frame-based
STN deep brain stimulation (DBS) procedure with microelectrode recording guidance. We calculated
coordinates of the active contact on DBS electrode on postoperative MRI, which we referred to
as the ﬁnal “functional/optimal” target. The coordinates calculated by the atlas-based “indirect”
and “direct” methods, as well as the coordinates of the different RN borders were compared to
these ﬁnal coordinates. Results: The mean ± SD of the ﬁnal target coordinates was 11.7 ± 1.5 mm
lateral (X), 2.4 ± 1.5 mm posterior (Y), and 6.1 ± 1.7 mm inferior to the mid-commissural point
(Z). No signiﬁcant differences were found between the “indirect” X, Z coordinates and those of the
ﬁnal targets. The “indirect” Y coordinate was signiﬁcantly posterior to Y of the ﬁnal target, with
mean difference of 0.6 mm (p = 0.014). No signiﬁcant differences were found between the “direct”
X, Y, and Z coordinates and those of the ﬁnal targets. Conclusions: The functional STN target is
located in direct proximity to its anatomical center. During preoperative targeting, we recommend
using the “direct” method, and taking into consideration the relationships of the ﬁnal target to the
mid-commissural point (MCP) and the different RN borders.

1. Introduction
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is the gold standard surgical treatment of advanced Parkinson’s
disease (PD). The subthalamic nucleus (STN) has been used for the last two decades as the target of
choice for this procedure [1].
The STN is a small gray matter structure located at the junction of the midbrain and
diencephalon. It has anatomic relationships to the internal capsule and the Globus Pallidus Internus
(GPi) anterolaterally, the Zona Incerta (ZI) and the thalamus superiorly, ﬁbers of the third nerve
anteromedially, the red nucleus (RN) posteromedially, and the cerebral peduncle and the Substantia

Nigra (SN) ventrally [2,3]. The target of DBS is the sensorimotor (dorsolateral) part of the STN [4,5].
This complex anatomy of the STN necessitates precise targeting during DBS surgeries.
There are two conventional methods for pre-operative localization of the STN [6]. The ﬁrst
is the indirect targeting; in which a brain atlas is used to deﬁne the coordinates of the STN in
relation to the midcommissural point (MCP). The second is the direct method, which was developed
by the work of Bejjani et al. in 2000 [7] in which the STN is directly visualized as a hypointense
structure on T2 weighted images. Direct localization became easier with the improvements of magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) sequences and the use of special stereotactic software to perform 3D image
reconstruction and help in the calculations [8–12]. Many studies assessed the direct coordinates and
compared them to the coordinates obtained by the indirect method [13–17]. Yet, the exact correlation
between these two conventional methods and the postoperative ﬁnal (functional) target has not
been established.
In this paper, we considered the ﬁnal position of the best active electrode contact on the
postoperative MRI images as the “true functional stimulation site” or the “ﬁnal target”. This ﬁnal target
position is conﬁrmed by the intra-operative microelectrode recording (MER) and the postoperative
improvement of the Parkinsonian symptoms. We compared these ﬁnal coordinates to the initial
coordinates calculated by both the direct and indirect methods.
2. Objectives
Assessment of the accuracy of the conventional methods of “direct” and “indirect” localization of
STN target vs. the ﬁnal functional target. This may help us to determine the optimal coordinates for
the STN DBS target. We also aim to study the relationships of the ﬁnal functional target coordinates to
the coordinates of the different borders of the RN, in attempt to ﬁnd any new relationships that can
improve the preoperative planning. This may eventually increase the accuracy of the preoperative
targeting, and subsequently decrease the intra-operative time needed for the MER and the number
of microelectrode insertion tracks needed to reach the target, and consequently reducing the rate
of complications.
3. Methods
After obtaining an appropriate institutional review board (IRB) approval, we retrospectively
analyzed the data of all patients diagnosed with advanced Parkinson’s disease who underwent
bilateral STN-DBS at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) in the period from January 2013 to
December 2014. From a total of 40 bilateral STN-DBS procedures that were performed over this period,
we included in this analysis 23 patients (46 targets) who had available postoperative MRI images, and a
minimum follow up period of 6 months with documented clinical improvement on ﬁxed stimulation
parameters. We excluded the patients with postoperative complications causing abnormalities in the
electrode position (1 patient), those who did not get a beneﬁcial clinical effect from the stimulation
(1 patient), and those whose follow-up visits (15 patients) took place in other institutions.
3.1. The Preoperative Planning and the Surgical Procedure
The surgery was done in two stages. The ﬁrst stage involves implantation of the DBS electrodes
under local anesthesia. Procedure starts with application of Leksell stereotactic frame Model G
(Elekta Instruments, Atlanta, GA, USA) to the patient’s head.
A high-resolution MRI of the patient’s brain with a 3 Tesla scanner (Signa 3T94 VHi;
General Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI, USA) was done. Two main sequences were obtained.
The ﬁrst is a 3D T1-weighted, spoiled gradient echo imaging of the entire head (section thickness: 2 mm;
ﬁeld of view: 26 × 26 cm; TR: 7.0–8.0 milliseconds; TE: ~400 milliseconds; ﬂip angle: 12; band width:
31.25 KHz; acquisition time: <7 min). The second is high-resolution, contiguous, T2-weighted, fast
spin-echo imaging through the region of the midbrain and basal ganglia (section thickness: 1.5 mm;

78

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 65

slice interval: 0 mm; matrix size: 512 × 512; ﬁeld of view: 26 × 26 cm; TR: 4600–6200 milliseconds; TE:
95–108 milliseconds; acquisition time: <5 min) (Figure 1).

the two subthalamic nuclei (STN).

3.1.1. The “Indirect” Method of the STN Coordinates Calculation
At the end of the scan, we chose the axial T2 image (or two adjacent images) in which the anterior
commissure (AC) and the posterior commissure (PC) are identiﬁed (Figure 2). Then, we measured the
distance between the middle and lower ﬁducials on both sides of the frame, and a maximum of 2 mm
difference was allowed. The X and Y MR coordinate of the center of the frame was obtained at the
point of meeting of two diagonal lines drawn on the MR console between the opposing anterior and
posterior ﬁducials. After that, the X and Y MR coordinates of both the AC, the PC, and the center of
the frame (Figure 3) were obtained from the MR console, and entered into a simple Excel worksheet
(Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) designed by the senior author.

posterior commissure at the same cut.

the magnetic resonance scanner console. (A) Two diagonal lines intersecting at the center of the frame at
the AC level with the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) coordinates of the center of the frame shown
inside the red square; (B) a crosshair at the posterior margin of the AC, with the MRI coordinates of the
AC shown inside the red square. Two lines are drawn between the middle and the lower ﬁducials on
both sides of the frame and their lengths (in the blue rectangle) are used to calculate the Z coordinate
of the AC; (C) two diagonal lines intersecting at the center of the frame at the PC level with the MRI
coordinates of the center of the frame shown inside the red square; (D) a crosshair at the anterior
margin of the PC, with the MRI coordinates of the PC shown inside the red square. Two lines are
drawn between the middle and the lower ﬁducials on both sides of the frame and their lengths (in the
blue rectangle) are used to calculate the Z coordinates of the PC.

Afterwards, the frame coordinates of the AC, PC, the mid-commissural point (MCP), and the
intercommissural distance (should be from 21 to 28 mm) were calculated with the help of this Excel
worksheet by using the following formulas:
X coordinates of the AC = 100 + MRI scanner X coordinates of the AC − MRI scanner X
coordinates of the center of the frame
Y coordinates of the AC = 100 + MRI scanner Y coordinates of the AC − MRI scanner Y
coordinates of the center of the frame
Z coordinates of the AC = 40 + distance between the lower and middle ﬁducials
at the AC-PC plane
Intercommisural distance =

Based on the known anatomical relationship of the STN to the MCP from previous anatomical
studies and stereotactic atlases [18–21], we selected the STN target at 12 mm lateral, 3 mm posterior,
and 6 mm inferior to the MCP. We used the following formulas to do the calculations:

3.1.2. The “Direct” Method of the STN Coordinates Calculation
The STN is the hypointense structure located lateral and anterior to the red nucleus on axial T2
MRI (Figure 4) [8]. The center of the STN hypointensity was identiﬁed at the extension of a straight
line drawn at the anterior margin of the RN bisecting the STN. Then, the coordinates were calculated
using the same Excel worksheet.

Figure 4. Calculating the subthalamic nucleus (STN) coordinates from the magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) console. (A) two diagonal lines intersecting at the center of the frame at the STN level with
MRI coordinates of the center of the frame shown inside the red square; (B) a crosshair at the center of
the left STN, with its MRI coordinates shown inside the red square, two line are drawn between the
middle and lower ﬁducials on both sides of the frame and their lengths (in the blue rectangle) are used
to calculate the Z coordinate; (C) a crosshair at the center of the right STN, with its MRI coordinates
shown inside the red square, two line are drawn between the middle and lower ﬁducials on both sides
of the frame and their lengths (in the blue rectangle) are used to calculate the Z coordinate.

In the operation room, we used the FrameLink software, which is a part of StealthStation
navigation system (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) to conﬁrm our calculations of the direct
STN coordinates (Figure 5). This software compensates for head and frame tilt in any direction.
The ﬁnal coordinates for the procedure were derived from the two techniques, and subsequently
adjusted using intraoperative electrical microrecording and macrostimulation.

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 65

During surgery, we performed microelectrode recording (MER) of the brain activity using a
NeuroNav microelectrode recording system (AlphaOmega, Nazareth, Israel). Fluoroscopic confirmation
of the target approach was obtained at 5 mm intervals, 2 mm above the target, and at the target (Figure 6).
During MER, the STN is the most electrically active structure encountered during the recording.
An indicator of entry into the STN is the increase of the background activity (Figure 7). The STN cells
have a mean ﬁring rate of 37 ± 17 Hz with high amplitude and irregular ﬁring pattern [22]. We used
the following criteria for choosing an ideal STN target:
-

The length of the STN, measured along its trajectory, is 4–5 mm.
Dense discharge patterns recorded in the STN.
The presence of an identiﬁable region of increased neuronal ﬁring at the STN on sensorimotor
stimulation of the contralateral limbs.

(C–E); and the ﬁnal coordinates of the right subthalamic nucleus (F).

background activity, with high amplitude irregular ﬁring.

After identiﬁcation of the STN borders and depth by the MER, we started high frequency
macrostimulation. The aim of the stimulation was to conﬁrm the optimal target, which provides
adequate control of the parkinsonian symptoms (most identiﬁable is the tremor), with no undesirable
effects from stimulation below 4 V.
We tried to minimize the number of the tracks used for recording and stimulation to reach the STN as
possible (Figure 6). The maximum number of tracks we used for a single side target was three (Figure 8).

is inserted posterior to the original one due to suboptimal subthalamic nucleus (STN) signal during
mapping along the original trajectory; (B) the ﬁnal position of the deep brain stimulation (DBS)
electrode in the new posterior trajectory.

Once we reached our desired target, we removed the microelectrode and replaced it with
a standard four contact (0–3) deep brain stimulation electrode (Medtronic DBS lead 3389).
Generally, we placed the deepest electrode contact (0) at or just beyond the target point.
Then, we repeated the testing using this electrode in order to conﬁrm the reproducibility of the
beneﬁcial effects and high thresholds for the undesirable effects (Figures 6 and 8). We locked the
83

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 65

electrode in place using a Stimloc device (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Then, the same
procedure was repeated again for the opposite side electrode.
After removal of the stereotactic frame, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit.
Upon arrival, all patients had a CT scan of the head to rule out the presence of intracerebral hemorrhage.
They all had an MRI of the brain in the same day of surgery or the next day to check the position of the
electrodes prior to discharge home.
The patient returned to hospital after one week for the second stage, in which the implantable
pulse generator (IPG) was implanted under general anesthesia.
3.2. Postoperative Calculation of the Active Contact Coordinates
Postoperative MRI images of the patients were loaded to the Medtronic Stealth station and the
Framelink stereotactic software was used to perform fusion of the pre and the postoperative MRI
images. This allowed us to get the coordinates of the active DBS electrode in relation to the mid
commissural point (MCP). The ﬁrst step after image fusion was to identify the tip of the DBS electrode.
We chose a point at the center of the hypointense signal representing the tip of the electrode in all
the three orthogonal planes and we marked it as our target. Then, we identiﬁed and marked the
entry point of the electrode into the brain. The computer software then was able to draw a trajectory
overlapping the electrode’s pathway through the brain. Then, using a probe eye view we could
move along this trajectory from the distal tip upwards. We moved by 0.25 mm increments until we
reached the predetermined position of the active contact and we got its coordinates in relation to the
MCP coordinates.
As all our patients were followed up for at least a period of 6 months, in our study, we collected
the data of the stimulating electrodes combinations that gave them optimal clinical response and no
undesirable effects at the lowest stimulation voltage. The Medtronic 3389 electrode which we used has
four contacts that can be named 0, 1, 2, 3 (or 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8, 9, 10, 11) with contacts 0, 4 or 8 being the
most distal and they are located 1.5 mm proximal to the tip of the electrode (Figure 9). The contacts are
1.5 mm in length and are separated by 0.5 mm intervals. We used a previously published methodology
to calculate the coordinates of the active contact [23,24]. The midpoint of the ﬁrst contact (0, 4, or 8) is
located 2.25 mm cranial to the tip of the electrode, the midpoints of the second contact (1, 5, or 9) is
located 4.25 mm cranial to the tip, the midpoint of the third contact (2, 6, or 10) is located 6.25 mm
cranial to the tip, and the midpoint of the fourth contact (3, 7, or 11) is located 8.25 mm cranial to
the tip. If the patient had a double monopolar electrodes combination, we chose our target to be the
midpoint between the two cathodes. If he had a bipolar combination, we chose the cathode as our
target [23,24].

(DBS) electrode model (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA).

We also calculated X coordinate of the lateral RN border, Y coordinate of the anterior RN border,
and Z coordinate of the superior RN border to compare them with X, Y, and Z coordinates of the active
contact respectively.

3.3. Data Processing and Statistical Analysis
The ﬁnal active contact coordinates, being conﬁrmed intra-operatively in all the patients as the
STN functional target, and with documented postoperative beneﬁcial clinical effect, were compared to
the coordinates obtained by the preoperative indirect atlas based calculations and to those obtained
by direct visualization. All coordinates were recorded based on the relationships of the target to
the MCP, and all the distances were measured in millimeters. Data were initially recorded using
a Microsoft Excel work sheet. We subtracted X, Y, and Z of the ﬁnal active electrode coordinates
from the corresponding X, Y, and Z of direct and indirect STN coordinates. We also calculated the
distances between X coordinate of the lateral RN border, Y coordinate of the anterior RN border, and Z
coordinate of the superior RN border and the ﬁnal coordinates. We also calculated the Euclidean
distances between the ﬁnal active contact coordinates and the preoperative direct and indirect targets
coordinates in three dimensions. The Euclidean distance is the “ordinary” (i.e., straight-line) distance
between two points (p and q) in the Euclidean space. With this distance, the Euclidean space becomes
a metric space. In a three-dimensional system with p at (p1 , p2 , p3 ) and q at (q1 , q2 , q3 ). The Euclidean
√
distance is calculated by using the formula [d(p,q) = (p1 − q1 )2 + (p2 − q3 )2 + (p3 − q3 )2 ].
We coded, tabulated, and statistically analyzed our data using the IBM SPSS statistics software
version 22.0 (IBM Corp., Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive statistics were done for quantitative data
as minimum & maximum of the range, mean ± SD (standard deviation), median, and conﬁdence
interval (CI) while we calculated numbers and percentages for qualitative data, as well as well as
95% conﬁdence interval for both. Inferential analyses were done using the one-sample t-test and the
paired t-test. The null hypothesis was that there is no difference between the direct, the indirect STN
targets, the borders of RN, and the ﬁnal electrode coordinates. The level of signiﬁcance was taken at
p-value < 0.05.
4. Results
The most commonly used electrode contacts for stimulation were the second (1, 5, 9) and the third
contacts (2, 6, 10), and each of them was used in used in 15 targets (32.6%). The most commonly used
double monopolar combination was between the second and the third contact (N = 4, 8.7%) (Figure 10).

There was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in ED of the ﬁnal active contact to the direct target
vs. the distance of the ﬁnal active contact to the indirect target with the mean difference 0.08 mm
(95% conﬁdence interval −0.3–0.4 mm, and p = 0.674).
5. Discussion
In our practice, we use both the direct and the indirect methods for the preoperative planning.
However, it is not unusual to move the electrode into different coordinates of STN based on
intraoperative neurophysiological ﬁndings. This may happen when our planned target does not exhibit
an adequate pattern of the STN signal on MER or it turns out to be too close to the nearby structures
causing undesired effects. Therefore, we may move the electrode position a few millimeters away from
the originally planned one to reach a better functioning stimulation site (Figure 8). Hamani et al. [25]
compared the coordinates of the different borders of STN as identiﬁed on MRI to the coordinates
identiﬁed by MER of STN activity. In their results, 15 tracks (52% of the tracks) had STN-like activity
outside the identiﬁed borders of STN on MRI (mostly by 1 mm) [25].
This study comes as a continuation of our previous efforts to deﬁne the optimal method to
calculate the coordinates for the different DBS procedures [6,26]. We considered the ﬁnal position of
the active electrode contact on the postoperative MRI as the “true functional stimulation site” or the
89

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 65

“ﬁnal target”. This ﬁnal target position is conﬁrmed by the intra-operative MER and the postoperative
improvement of the parkinsonian symptoms. We compared these ﬁnal coordinates to the initial
coordinates calculated by both the direct and indirect methods. We also studied the relations of the
ﬁnal functional target coordinates to the coordinates of the different borders of RN in attempt to ﬁnd
any new relations that can improve the preoperative planning. The reason why we chose RN is its
close proximity to STN, and the fact that the borders of RN are well visualized on MRI even better
than those of STN.
In our results, both the direct X and the indirect X coordinates did not show a statistically
signiﬁcant difference from the ﬁnal X coordinate. These results conﬁrm that X of the ﬁnal functional
target of STN corresponds to X of the anatomical center calculated by either of the two methods.
The difference between the direct X coordinate calculation and the ﬁnal X had smaller mean, variance,
and narrower range, and CI than the difference between the indirect and the ﬁnal X (Table 1). The mean
value of X coordinate of the ﬁnal active contact was 11.7 mm lateral to MCP with 95% CI = 11.2–12.2 mm.
The mean distance between X coordinates of the lateral RN border and X coordinate of the ﬁnal target
(X of RN-X ﬁnal) was 3.4 mm on the medial side, with 95% CI = 4.0–2.9 mm. Accordingly, we suggest
for preoperative calculation of X coordinate to choose our X at the center of the hypointensity range
representing STN on an axial MRI image, taking into consideration that most of the functional STN
targets lie 11–12.5 mm lateral to MCP, and 3–4 mm lateral to the lateral RN border.
In regard to Y coordinate, comparison of the direct Y coordinate to the ﬁnal Y coordinate showed
no statistically signiﬁcant difference. In addition, there was no statistically signiﬁcant difference
between the Y coordinate of the anterior RN border and the Y coordinate of the active contact.
Meanwhile, a comparison of the indirect Y coordinate to the ﬁnal Y coordinate showed a statistically
signiﬁcant difference. These results conﬁrm that Y of the ﬁnal functional target of the STN corresponds
to Y of the anatomical center calculated by direct visualization on MRI at the extension of a straight
line drawn at the anterior margin of the RN, as suggested by Bejjani et al. in 2000 [7]. The mean value
of the Y coordinate of the ﬁnal target was 2.4 mm posterior to the MCP with 95% CI = 2.0–2.9 mm.
Accordingly, we suggest for the preoperative calculation of the Y coordinate to choose our Y at the
center of the hypointensity range representing the STN in an axial MRI image. During the calculation,
we should take into consideration that most of the functional STN targets lie 2–3 mm posterior to the
MCP, and at the same Y of a straight line drawn at the anterior margin of the RN.
In regard to the Z coordinate, both the direct Z and the indirect Z coordinates did not show a
statistically signiﬁcant difference from the ﬁnal Z coordinate. These results conﬁrm that Z of the ﬁnal
functional target of STN corresponds to the Z of the anatomical center calculated by either of the
two methods. The mean value of the Z coordinate of the ﬁnal active contact was 6.1 mm inferior
to MCP with a 95% CI = 5.6–6.6 mm. The mean distance of the Z coordinate of the superior RN
border and the Z coordinate of the ﬁnal contact (Z of RN-Z ﬁnal) was 3.5 mm more superior, with the
95% CI = 4.0–2.9 mm. Accordingly, we suggest for the preoperative calculation of the Z coordinate
to choose our Z at the center of the hypointensity representing STN on coronal MRI, taking into
consideration that most of the STN functional targets lie between 5.5 and 6.6 mm inferior to MCP, and
3–4 mm inferior to the superior RN border.
The results of this study show that both the indirect and the direct methods of localization
correspond largely to the ﬁnal functional target in calculating X and Z coordinates, with the direct
visualization being more accurate. Nevertheless, the indirect Y coordinate was signiﬁcantly posterior to
Y of the ﬁnal optimal target. Ashkan et al. [13] calculated the indirect STN coordinates at 12 mm lateral,
2 mm posterior, and 4 mm inferior to MCP. They compared these indirect coordinates with those
obtained by direct visualization. Their results showed that, on average, the directly visualized target
compared to the atlas target was 1.7 mm more medial (p < 0.0001), 0.7 mm more anterior (p < 0.001)
and 0.7 mm more ventral (p < 0.0001).
In our indirect calculations, we used the Z coordinate at 6 mm inferior to MCP. Our results showed
that there was no signiﬁcant difference between this Z coordinate and the ﬁnal Z value. This is different

90

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 65

from other studies that used other values of Z coordinates such as 3 [27], 4 [13,28–31], or 5 [16] mm
inferior to MCP. These studies found a signiﬁcant difference in the Z coordinate calculation between
the indirect and the direct [16,31] targeting or between the indirect and the ﬁnal target [27,30].
To our best knowledge, no studies calculated the difference in the distance between the ﬁnal STN
coordinates and the coordinates of the different RN borders. Andrade-Souza et al. [27] used coordinates
derived from the stereotactic atlases to preoperatively plan STN targets based on the coordinates
of different RN borders. They deﬁned an X coordinate 3 mm lateral to the lateral RN border, a Y
coordinate at the same Y of the anterior RN border, and a Z coordinate as 2 mm inferior to the superior
RN border. They calculated the mean ± SD of the differences between the preoperative RN based
calculations and the ﬁnal targets; X = 1.82 ± 1.38 mm, Y = 1.62 ± 1.05 mm, and Z = 1.37 ± 0.93 mm.
Houshmand et al. [16] used the same parameters used by Andrade-Souza et al. [27] to calculate STN
target coordinates based on the coordinates of different RN borders. They calculated the distances
between different RN borders and the STN anatomical center seen on 3T MRI. They calculated the
mean ± SD of the differences between the preoperative RN based calculation and the ﬁnal targets;
X = 0.67 ± 0.45 mm, Y = 0.77 ± 0.54 mm, and Z = 0.56 ± 0.40 mm. Both of those studies found that
the RN base targeting was closer to the optimal target, than the direct or the indirect calculations.
Starr et al. [29] considered the center of the DBS electrode array in the postoperative MRI as the ﬁnal
target, and they calculated the mean distance between its coordinates and X and Y coordinates of the
center of RN (X = 6.5 mm lateral, Y = 3.5 mm anterior).
Despite the great similarities of the ﬁnal coordinates to that of the preoperatively planned direct
and indirect coordinates, the Euclidean distances between the ﬁnal targets and both the direct and
indirect targets were found to have statistically signiﬁcantly differences. This in addition to the
wide range of values of the different coordinates of the ﬁnal targets in relation to MCP (X = 8.2–16.0,
Y = 0.0–6.2, Z = 1.5–9.0) exclude the possibility of depending on the preoperative planning as the sole
method of targeting STN. We believe that the intra-operative physiological and clinical conﬁrmation
of the target is crucial in the ﬁnal position conﬁrmation. Still, initial anatomical and radiological
planning is also essential in target selection. Accurate preoperative planning would decrease the
intra-operative time needed for MER, and the number of microelectrodes tracks needed to reach the
target, and subsequently prevent additional complication. This fact is supported by our experience,
as our average number of MER tracks was 1.4 tracks.
6. Conclusions
The functional target of STN corresponds to the anatomical center of STN as seen in the three
orthogonal planes of MRI images. During the preoperative calculation of the STN target, we prefer
using the direct method, and taking into consideration that most of the functional targets are
located: (1) 11–12.5 mm lateral to MCP, and 3–4 mm lateral to the lateral RN border; (2) 2–3 mm
posterior to MCP, and at the same Y of a straight line drawn at the anterior margin of the red nuclei;
(3) 5.5–6.6 mm inferior to MCP, and 3–4 mm inferior to the superior RN border. It seems that the
preoperative anatomical/radiological planning cannot be used as the sole method of targeting the STN,
intra-operative physiological and clinical conﬁrmation is crucial in the ﬁnal position conﬁrmation.

Abstract: New deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrode designs offer operation in voltage and current
mode and capability to steer the electric ﬁeld (EF). The aim of the study was to compare the EF
distributions of four DBS leads at equivalent amplitudes (3 V and 3.4 mA). Finite element method
(FEM) simulations (n = 38) around cylindrical contacts (leads 3389, 6148) or equivalent contact
conﬁgurations (leads 6180, SureStim1) were performed using homogeneous and patient-speciﬁc
(heterogeneous) brain tissue models. Steering effects of 6180 and SureStim1 were compared with
symmetric stimulation ﬁelds. To make relative comparisons between simulations, an EF isolevel of
0.2 V/mm was chosen based on neuron model simulations (n = 832) applied before EF visualization
and comparisons. The simulations show that the EF distribution is largely inﬂuenced by the
heterogeneity of the tissue, and the operating mode. Equivalent contact conﬁgurations result in
similar EF distributions. In steering conﬁgurations, larger EF volumes were achieved in current mode
using equivalent amplitudes. The methodology was demonstrated in a patient-speciﬁc simulation
around the zona incerta and a “virtual” ventral intermediate nucleus target. In conclusion, lead design
differences are enhanced when using patient-speciﬁc tissue models and current stimulation mode.

1. Introduction
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established technique to alleviate the symptoms caused
by several movement disorders such as Parkinson’s disease and essential tremor. DBS is now also
expanding towards other symptoms such as psychiatric illness [1]. The technique has been proven to
be successful even though the mechanisms of action are still uncertain, which makes it difﬁcult to have
complete control on the desired effect and avoid side effects.
Traditionally, DBS systems have operated in voltage mode using conventional ring-shaped
electrodes generating a symmetrical stimulation ﬁeld around the lead. Recently, new electrode designs
offer the capability to steer the stimulation ﬁeld allowing some compensation for a possible lead
misplacement [2,3]. The operating mode has also been modiﬁed delivering current instead of voltage
stimulation. Current controlled systems, in comparison to voltage, automatically adjust the voltage to
changes in the surrounding tissue impedance, in order to deliver a constant current [4]. Brain tissue is
an electrically conductive medium in which the distribution of the electric ﬁeld (EF) can be calculated

and visualized with computer models that solve the corresponding differential equation. In this study,
the ﬁnite element method (FEM) has been used to evaluate and compare the EF from four different
leads used in DBS systems.
Numerous computational models have been used to predict and visualize the ﬁrst derivative
of the electric potential, i.e., the EF [5–8] or the second derivative of the electric potential generated
by DBS systems [9,10]. However, these are usually employed using traditional leads with voltage
control operating mode. We have previously compared the conventional leads Medtronic 3389 and
St. Jude Medical 6148 in different operating modes and time points [11]. Other simulations studied
the inﬂuence from heterogeneity and anisotropy for the 3389 lead [12,13]. This study extends the
comparisons to include two steering ﬁeld leads, St. Jude Medical 6180 and Medtronic SureStim1.
When comparing FEM simulations, a ﬁxed isolevel EF has been useful in making relative simulation
comparisons for the 3389 lead [5,6,8]. In a previous study [14], neuron model simulations were run for
a range of stimulation amplitudes, pulse lengths and axon diameters. These settings and physiological
parameters should be taken into account in the choice of isolevel.
The aim of the study was to compare four DBS lead EF distributions in both voltage and current
modes as presented in homogenous and heterogeneous, i.e., patient-speciﬁc, tissue models for the
zona incerta (ZI) and the ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) brain targets. Furthermore, steering effect
simulations were investigated and compared with conventional 3389 lead EF. Visualization of the
3389 EF for the implanted ZI target with the patient-speciﬁc stimulation settings was demonstrated.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Patient Data, Surgery and Imaging
DBS data and images from one patient with tremor dominant Parkinson’s disease implanted
in the ZI at the Department of Neurosurgery, Linköping University Hospital were included in the
study. An additional “virtual target”, VIM, along the planned trajectory was used for the simulations.
Informed written consent was received from the patient and the study was approved by the local
ethics committee in Linköping (2012/434-31).
Prior to surgery and under general anaesthesia, the Leksell Stereotactic System (G frame,
Elekta Instrument AB, Linköping, Sweden) was attached. Thereafter, a 3 Tesla, T2-weigthed magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) Philips Intera, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) with 2 mm contiguous axial
slices (2 × 0.5 × 0.5) mm3 was performed. Direct anatomical targeting was planned using Surgiplan®
(Elekta Instrument AB). Surgery followed the routine protocol [15] for DBS implantation and was
completed in a single procedure. The probe’s position was veriﬁed by intraoperative ﬂuoroscopy
(Philips BV Pulsera, Philips Medical Systems, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). A postoperative computer
tomography (CT) was performed to conﬁrm the lead’s positioning the day after surgery, and a second
CT was taken after 4.5 weeks (chronic time point). These CT images were separately co-registered with
the preoperative MRI using Surgiplan® . From the postoperative image artefacts, the surgeon noted
the Leksell® coordinates (x, y, z) of a point at the lowest contact and another reference point 10 mm
above the AC-PC line along the lead axis. These coordinates were used to place the lead within the
brain model. The electrode position at the chronic time point was considered for the simulations in
this study. The Leksell® coordinates for ZI and VIM targets were also identiﬁed for simulations.
2.2. FEM Modelling and Simulation
The leads and brain tissue were modelled in the FEM software COMSOL Multiphysics 5.2
(Comsol AB, Stockholm, Sweden).
2.2.1. DBS Leads
The lead geometry was based on the specifications from the corresponding manufacturing
companies (Figure 1). Lead 3389 (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) and lead 6148

95

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 39

(St. Jude Medical Inc., Saint Paul, MN, USA) consist of four cylindrical platinum iridium alloy electrodes
or contacts separated by 0.5 mm of insulating material. The contacts are 1.5 mm long except for lead
6148’s distal contact which is 3 mm long and covers the tip of the lead. The lead 3389 has a diameter of
1.27 mm and a contact surface of 6 mm2 while lead 6148 is 1.4 mm, with a contact surface area of 6.6 mm2 .
The steering lead 6180 (St. Jude Medical Inc., Saint Paul, MN, USA) has the same dimensions as lead 3389
and similar disposition of the contacts except for the two middle contacts which are partitioned axially
into three sections; a single segment of the split-ring contact has a surface area of 1.8 mm2 . SureStim1 lead
(Medtronic Eindhoven Design Centre BV, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) also has a diameter of 1.27 mm
and consists of 40 elliptical contacts of 0.66 × 0.74 mm2 arranged on 10 rows of four contacts each, along
the lead; each contact surface area is 0.39 mm2 [2]. The stereotactic coordinates obtained from Surgiplan®
from the co-registered postoperative CT along with the fiducial points of the preoperative MRI were used
to calculate the Cartesian coordinates and the angle of the lead for the FEM mode. The first contact of the
lead 3389 was placed at the lower point noted by the surgeon; lead 6148 and the steering leads’ locations
were adjusted to match the middle point of the active contacts.

2.2.2. Brain Tissue Model
Patient-speciﬁc brain tissue models were based on preoperative MRI. An in-house developed
program (ELMA) [16,17] was used to convert the medical images into COMSOL FEM software
readable ﬁles. With the ELMA tool, the preoperative image was cropped to a region of interest
(Figure 2a), including the VIM and the ZI. Within that region, the tissue was classiﬁed into grey matter,
white matter, blood or cerebrospinal ﬂuid based on the image intensity values. Average intensity
values were calculated from three slices of the preoperative image set. Finally, the electrical
conductivity, σ, was assigned according to grey matter (σ = 0.123 S/m), white matter (σ = 0.075 S/m),
blood (σ = 0.7 S/m) and cerebrospinal ﬂuid (σ = 2.0 S/m). The corresponding electric conductivities for
each tissue type were obtained from tabulated values [18,19] weighted with the spectral distribution of
the pulse shape [20]. The conductivity for each voxel was calculated by an interpolation function which
takes into account the effects of partial volumes, thus voxels with intensity levels between grey and
white matter receive an electrical conductivity between grey and white matter. The result was a cuboid
of about 100 mm per side (Figure 2b) containing the electrical conductivity values for each classiﬁed
voxel of the preoperative MR image. The model included a peri-electrode space (PES) of 0.25 mm
to mimic the electrode–tissue interface at the chronic stage [21]. The electrical conductivity assigned

96

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 39

to the PES corresponded to the white matter assuming its similarity to ﬁbrous tissue (σ = 0.075 S/m)
which is believed to wrap around the lead at the chronic stage [22].

view) and (b) Brain model displaying one slice of the interpolated conductivity matrix (cranio-caudal
point of view) and the trajectory of the lead. Axial images displayed at the level of the ZI.

The electric ﬁeld was calculated by the equation for steady currents:

∇·J = −∇·(σ∇V ) = 0 (A/m3 )

(1)

where J is the current density (A/m2 ), V is the electric potential (V). For patient-speciﬁc models,
σ corresponds to the interpolation matrix extracted by ELMA. For the homogeneous model, a single
σ value corresponding to grey matter conductivity was considered for the whole brain tissue.
The electrodes were set in a monopolar conﬁguration where the active contact is considered as
a voltage or current source and the outer boundaries are grounded (V = 0 V). For the conventional
leads, the third contact (C2 and C3, for Medtronic 3389 and St. Jude 6148 respectively) was active.
For SureStim1 eight consecutive electrodes corresponding to ring 6 and 7 were selected, and for the
St. Jude 6180 lead the contacts 5, 6, 7 constituting the third ring were active. The active contacts
of each lead were driven with either 3 V or 3.4 mA which is the equivalent current amplitude for
Medtronic 3389 lead in a homogeneous model (σ = 0.123 S/m). The equivalent stimulation current
value was considered as that required to achieve the same electric ﬁeld to the one obtained with

voltage control [11]. The inactive contacts were set to ﬂoating potential ( −n·σ ∇VdS = 0 ( A);
n × (−∇V ) = 0 (V/m)) and the non-conductive surfaces of the lead were set to electric insulation
(n·∇V = 0 (V/m)) where n is the surface normal vector. The mesh applied was physics-controlled
with a denser distribution around the leads. The mesh was set to the ﬁnest resolution available
resulting in more than 2,000,000 tetrahedral elements (minimum element size of 0.026 mm). For the
steering conﬁguration, a single contact (C5) was selected for lead 6180 while for lead SureStim1,
four contacts in a diamond conﬁguration (two adjacent contacts from ring 6 and one contact from
ring 5 and 7 anteriorly oriented) were active. The 3D models with ~3 million degrees of freedom were
solved using the iterative COMSOL built-in conjugate gradients solver.
2.3. Neuron Model Simulations
An axon cable model was used in combination with the FEM model. A complete description of
the neuron model is found in Åström et al. 2015 [14]. FEM modelling was completed for each lead
design (n = 16) with a stimulation amplitude of 1 V or 1 mA for both homogenous and patient-speciﬁc
brain tissue models for the VIM target. The electric potential was evaluated at the axial plane around
the lead’s third contact (Figure 3a). The potential lines were extracted from the medial, lateral,
posterior and anterior locations from the axial plane. The potential along the 62 parallel lines separated
97

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 39

by 0.1 mm was exported and used as input data to the cable model to calculate the neuron activation
distances. Simulations (n = 832) were performed for a ﬁxed pulse width (60 μs) with variation in
amplitudes (0.5–5 V in steps of 0.5 V; and 0.5–5 mA in steps of 0.5 mA) and variation in axon diameters
(1.5–7.5 μm in steps of 0.5 μm) (Figure 3b).

from the surface of the lead to the distance where activation no longer happens; (d) The graphical
implementation of the one data set.

2.4. Electric Field Simulations
FEM simulations of the electric ﬁeld (n = 38) were performed in different stages setting to 3 V or
3.4 mA the third contact or equivalent as previously described. First, homogenous and patient-speciﬁc
tissue models were investigated solely with lead 3389 (n = 6). Patient-speciﬁc simulations included
two targets, the ZI and the VIM. Secondly, patient-speciﬁc models (one for each target, moving the
leads accordingly, approximately 4 mm along the trajectory) were used to compare the electric ﬁeld
achieved by the four leads (n = 16) for the two operating modes. The patient-speciﬁc model of the
actual implantation site in ZI was also used to investigate the EF achieved by lead 3389 with the
actual stimulation 1.6 V, set four and a half weeks after implantation, which relieved the patient’s
symptoms. Simulations were also performed for the corresponding equivalent value in current mode
(n = 4). At last, simulations with steering conﬁgurations for lead 6180 and SureStim1 were performed
(n = 8). For investigation of the steering function, additional simulations (n = 4) were performed for
St. Jude 6180 and SureStim1 and compared with the Medtronic 3389 lead.
2.5. Data Analysis
The neuron model simulation output is a table of activation distances (mm) which can be presented
as plots against the stimulation amplitudes (Figure 3c,d). The average deviation in activation distances
between the leads was calculated as mean ± standard deviation (S.D.) for 3 V and 3.4 mA stimulation
amplitudes for all axon diameters simulated. An EF isolevel of 0.2 V/mm corresponding to an axon
diameter of approximately 4 μm was selected to compare the activation distances between the leads.
The EF isolevel 0.2 V/mm was superimposed on the preoperative 3T MRI, and visualized at
the axial, sagittal and coronal planes. The isocontours for each simulation were extracted in order
to measure the maximal distance (mm) from the isocontour to the centre of the active electrode.
A program in MatLab was developed for this purpose. COMSOL’s integration function was used to
98

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 39

calculate the volumes (mm3 ) inside the 0.2 V/mm EF isosurfaces for all leads. Relative differences
in percentages were calculated for voltage and current control in order to compare the results for (I)
homogeneous vs. patient-speciﬁc models; (II) 3389 lead vs. leads 6148, 6180 and SureStim1.
3. Results

3.2. Homogenous vs. Patient-Speciﬁc Models
The electric ﬁeld around the 3389 lead was compared for homogeneous and patient-speciﬁc
models at the ZI and the VIM. Figure 6 shows the inﬂuence of the heterogeneity of the tissue. The EF
extension for homogeneous tissue model was 3.3, 3.6 and 3.4 mm at the axial, sagittal and coronal
planes, respectively, while for the patient-speciﬁc model the extension varied from 3.3 to 3.9 mm.
The average EF distribution was 12% larger in current mode. This was valid for the three directions
explored, in both anatomical regions investigated. The EF volumes achieved at the ZI were larger than
those at VIM. The volumetric difference between targets (Table 1) was higher in current mode (12%)
than in voltage mode (5%).

The EF volumes (Figures 7 and 8) within the 0.2 V/mm isosurface were approximately 49%
larger for current controlled stimulation than for voltage mode. The relative difference of the EF
volumes between the ZI and the VIM are shown in Table 2, for voltage and current controlled
stimulation, respectively.
The electric ﬁeld simulated for the four different lead designs was visualized at axial, sagittal
and coronal planes crossing at the centre of each lead in the middle of the active contacts (Figure 9).
The maximum extension of the 0.2 V/mm isocontour in voltage mode was achieved with lead 6148

The patient-speciﬁc simulation for the ZI using lead 3389, is presented in Figure 10. The equivalent
amplitude for the patient-speciﬁc voltage of 1.6 V was 1.3 mA in current mode. This value achieved
the most similar EF extension (~2.5 mm) and volume (46 mm3 ) (Figure 10).

3.5. Steering Function
The EF volumes within the 0.2 V/mm isosurface and the corresponding isocontours (Figure 11,
Table 4) show that the EF distribution was notably different between operating modes for both leads.
The spatial extension of the electric ﬁeld was around 50% smaller in voltage mode. The smaller EF
volumes are shown in Figure 11a,b. The axial and coronal views (ﬁrst and third columns of Figure 11e)
show the steering effect on the EF. The large EF distribution achieved by 3.4 mA did not show the
steering effect (second and fourth columns of Figure 11e). The diamond conﬁguration used for
SureStim1 (1.6 mm2 surface area) achieved larger EF volume (Figure 11b) than that using one contact
of the 6180 lead (1.8 mm2 ) for voltage mode. The opposite relation was observed in current mode,
where 6180 lead achieved a larger EF volume (Figure 11d).

4. Discussion
In this study, the inﬂuence on the electric ﬁeld around DBS leads, from surrounding tissue and
lead design, has been investigated by means of computer simulations. Both symmetrical and steering
functions were considered and compared in current and voltage modes.

4.1. FEM and Neuron Modelling
The FEM models in this study have considered constant voltage and current amplitudes instead
of the actual biphasic pulse used for the stimulation. This implies a quasi-static solution for the
electric potential decoupled from the capacitive, inductive and wave propagation effects. Nevertheless,
the conductivity values, for this FEM simulation method, took into consideration the frequency and
pulse length components of the stimulation pulse [20]. The comparison of the leads relied on setting as
many variables (e.g., isolevel, neuron diameter, pulse width, frequency, tissue variability, time points)
to constant values. This results in an evaluation in a ﬁxed environment where the differences in the
achieved EF is sufﬁcient to assess the leads. The selection of the 0.2 V/mm isolevel was initially based
on previous studies by Hemm et al. [5] and Åström et al. [14]. However, the FEM model used by
Åström did not consider the PES and used a homogenous model with a slightly different conductivity
value for the grey matter. Therefore, the electric potential lines imported to the neuron model showed
minor deviations compared to the previous study. The neuron simulations in the present study
indicated that for neurons of 4 μm diameter, a 3 V drive potential reaches an activation distance of
3.2 mm. These results were tested against the FEM simulated EF extensions for one direction and
plane, which support the EF isolevel of 0.2 V/mm in the patient-speciﬁc model.
Neuron diameter results were in the range of those found in [14,23–25], with consideration for driving
parameter variations i.e., pulse width. FEM simulated EF extensions ranged from 3.3 to 3.5 mm in voltage
mode. The FEM simulation values would imply a neuronal diameter between 4 and 5 μm. These diameters
are at present a best guess at the true neuronal diameters in the vicinity of the electrode and should
encompass a range of small diameters. As expected, the activation distance for the patient-specific model
is distinct from that of the homogeneous model for all leads (Figures 5 and A1–A3).
A variation of 1 mm in activation distance with the working assumption of a 4 μm diameter
neuron would result in an increase in neuron recruitment of approximately 250 extra neurons along
a radius. For example, if the activation distance increases by 1 mm from 3 mm, the recruitment volume
would change to the power of three, i.e., neuron activation expands signiﬁcantly. An equivalent
decrease in activation distance would result in a possible reduction of activated neurons along any
radius from the centre of the volume. Calculating the activation distance in different directions
(medial, posterior, anterior, lateral) allowed us to assess the inﬂuence of the lead’s angle (trajectory)
and thus the sensitivity to the direction (Figures 5 and A1–A3).
4.2. Homogeneous vs. Patient-Speciﬁc Tissue Models
The initial part of the study encompasses a comparison between homogeneous and patient-speciﬁc
models for the standard 3389 lead in voltage and current modes. Several studies have shown the
impact of the anisotropy and heterogeneity of the brain model. The McIntyre group [17] compared the
axonal activation during monopolar DBS for different types of models, and concluded that simplistic
models, such as the homogeneous model, overestimate the extent of neural activation. Åström et al. [12]
observed an alteration of the electric ﬁeld when the brain was modelled as heterogeneous isotropic
tissue as opposed to homogeneous grey matter. These studies, however, were limited to voltage
control stimulation. The novelty of the present study relies on the inclusion of current controlled
stimulation. Our results show distinct behavior for each operating mode. The 3389 lead EF volume is
smaller for the patient-speciﬁc model than for the homogeneous model in voltage mode. In current
mode, on the contrary, the volume is larger. Furthermore, when comparing the EF volume between
targets, the EF difference is larger in current stimulation (12% vs. 5% for voltage). The interest in using
current controlled stimulation [26] partly relies on the consideration that it is the capacitive current
that determines the neuronal effect; maintaining a constant current presumably would avoid the
reprogramming of the DBS which normally occur for voltage controlled systems due to changes in the
tissue impedance around the lead [4]. In agreement, the review by Bronstein et al. [24] considers the
stimulation ﬁeld as the electrical delivery which is a function of the voltage divided by the impedance,
i.e., current.
104

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 39

The fundamental difference of this study is that the leads are evaluated in terms of the achieved
EF and not in the current delivery. The results are numerically obtained considering Equation (1),
where the EF is directly proportional to the current density and inversely proportional to the electrical
conductivity obeying Ohm’s law. The anisotropy of the tissue has not been included in the model,
nevertheless with the introduction of tractography and white matter tracing [7,27], this feature will be
important to consider in future simulations. Given that white matter is anisotropic, then the white
matter tracing can help make the tissue conductivity classiﬁcation even better.
4.3. DBS Leads Comparison
In the second part of the study, only patient-speciﬁc models were used to investigate the EF
achieved by four different lead designs operated in voltage and current modes. The results of the
simulations showed a very similar EF distribution around each lead, however SureStim1 showed
a more spherically shaped EF distribution. In general, the EF extension and volume were higher using
current mode and lower for voltage mode. The total current delivered by the electrode is determined
by the electrode surface area and the average of the current density. Thus, applying a ﬁxed total current
of 3.4 mA to a smaller active area, as SureStim1 lead (3.12 mm2 ) increases the current density, leading
to an increase of the EF (Equation (1)). An experimental evaluation of segmented electrodes by Wei
and Grill [28] showed that the electrode impedance was inversely proportional to its surface area.
This implies that larger contacts would require higher current intensities to achieve the same EF than
smaller electrodes. Another example of this behavior is lead 6148, which electrodes have the largest
surface area (6.6 mm2 ) achieving the smallest EF in current mode.
Several studies have compared the conventional steering leads either experimentally [29] or
based on computer models [2,30,31]. In the experimental study, Contarino et al. [29] temporally
inserted a 32 contact lead (similar to SureStim1) which was set with different conﬁgurations and
current stimulation amplitudes ranging from 0.5 to 8 mA. The steering lead was then replaced by the
permanent conventional 3389 lead. The performance of the steering lead was assessed by the current
thresholds required to either induce side effects or clinical beneﬁts in comparison to the conventional
lead outcome in patients undergoing DBS surgery. By setting 12 consecutive contacts, the Contarino
group observed equivalent current thresholds between the steering and the conventional leads. In the
present study, eight consecutive electrodes achieved a larger EF volume than the 3389 lead when
set to 3.4 mA, implying that choosing 12 contacts instead of eight would increase the difference
with the conventional lead even more. This result reﬂects the inﬂuence of the smaller electrodes of
SureStim1 lead.
Other computer based studies compared the steering and the conventional leads operated in
either voltage or current mode. Martens et al. [2], for instance, investigated a lead of 64 contacts
using eight consecutive contacts set to 2.6 mA and observed that a potential ﬁeld distribution very
similar to the generated by the standard ring electrode; our results showed a larger EF for SureStim1
in current mode. The difference between Martens’ model and ours, is the brain model. While they
consider homogeneous tissue with a single value of conductivity (0.1 S/m), we include a heterogeneous
matrix of electrical conductivities. Dijk et al. [28] also compared the steering lead (SureStim1) to the
conventional 3389 lead, however they quantiﬁed the stimulation effect in terms of the maximum
amount of subthalamic nucleus (STN) cells activated based on axon models. They observed equivalent
results between the standard and the directional lead by activating 12 consecutive contacts on the latter
lead. In addition, this group used biphasic current pulses and neuron diameters of 5.7 μm. Due to the
differences in the evaluation methodology and the model itself, our results are not directly comparable
to the results of other groups.
4.4. Patient-Speciﬁc Stimulation Amplitude Setting
For the actual amplitude programmed, 1.6 V, the EF volume within the 0.2 V/mm isosurface
was around 46 mm3 , and the extension was approximately 2.5 mm measured from the lead axis in all

105

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 39

directions. The clinical effect was satisfactory according to the patient journal, however, considering
the dimensions of the ZI which has an elongated shape of approximately 2 mm (latero-medial) and
4–5 mm (anterio-posterior), a symmetrical stimulation ﬁeld could possibly be improved by steering
the ﬁeld in the desired direction. The current amplitude required to achieve the same EF was 1.3 mA,
which in comparison to the equivalence for the homogeneous model, indicates a larger impedance for
the patient-speciﬁc model.
4.5. Steering DBS Leads
The steering function of lead 6180 and SureStim1 was evaluated in voltage and current mode.
As for the symmetrical conﬁguration, the EF was larger for current control. Setting 3.4 mA to a single
contact of lead 6180 (1.8 mm2 ) and to 4 contacts in SureStim1 (1.6 mm2 ) derived in a large EF which
did not show the directionality of the conﬁguration. By reducing the current stimulation amplitude
to 1.3 mA, it was possible to see the same steered proﬁle as that for 3 V. The reason for this behavior
is also due to the increase of the current density for smaller contact surface areas. In a similar way,
the directionality of the conﬁguration is not observable by lower EF isolevels. For instance, an isolevel
of 0.1 V/mm did not show the steered ﬁeld of 3 V. This is particularly interesting due to the uncertainty
of the EF intensity required to activate neighboring neurons. The EF volumes achieved by each lead in
the steering conﬁguration do not follow the rationale of smaller surface area, larger EF due to higher
current density. One of the reasons for this behavior could be that the active contacts do not have the
same orientation. While the electrodes for SureStim1 are oriented towards the anterior part of the model,
the single active contact for lead 6180 is oriented towards the lateral side. In voltage mode, the larger
EF volume obtained with smaller surface areas may respond to the increase of the current density due
to the higher number of edges [28]. Further investigations focused on different conﬁgurations for the
steering leads are necessary to satisfactorily assess the performance of directional leads.
5. Conclusions
In conclusion, the use of brain models based on patient-speciﬁc images and the comparison of two
operating modes have enhanced the assessment of the inﬂuence from the different lead designs on the
EF with a ﬁxed isolevel. The results showed that the EF distribution is inﬂuenced by the heterogeneity
of the tissue for both operating modes. Computer models can visualize the electric ﬁeld and thus
further increase understanding when switching the stimulation settings, lead designs and inter and
intra-patient conductivity variability.

Abstract: Schizophrenia patients are waiting for a treatment free of detrimental effects.
Psychotic disorders are devastating mental illnesses associated with dysfunctional brain networks.
Ongoing brain network gamma frequency (30–80 Hz) oscillations, naturally implicated in integrative
function, are excessively ampliﬁed during hallucinations, in at-risk mental states for psychosis
and ﬁrst-episode psychosis. So, gamma oscillations represent a bioelectrical marker for cerebral
network disorders with prognostic and therapeutic potential. They accompany sensorimotor and
cognitive deﬁcits already present in prodromal schizophrenia. Abnormally ampliﬁed gamma
oscillations are reproduced in the corticothalamic systems of healthy humans and rodents after
a single systemic administration, at a psychotomimetic dose, of the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate
receptor antagonist ketamine. These translational ketamine models of prodromal schizophrenia are
thus promising to work out a preventive noninvasive treatment against ﬁrst-episode psychosis and
chronic schizophrenia. In the present essay, transcranial electric stimulation (TES) is considered an
appropriate preventive therapeutic modality because it can inﬂuence cognitive performance and
neural oscillations. Here, I highlight clinical and experimental ﬁndings showing that, together,
the corticothalamic pathway, the thalamus, and the glutamatergic synaptic transmission form
an etiopathophysiological backbone for schizophrenia and represent a potential therapeutic target
for preventive TES of dysfunctional brain networks in at-risk mental state patients against
psychotic disorders.

1. Introduction
Neurobiological disorders of the brain are an immense burden with a rising cost in our
societies [1,2]. In the European Union, about a third of the total population suffers from mental
disorders [2], and we are still missing effective treatments, free of side-effects, against complex
neuropsychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia.
Schizophrenia is a progressive, debilitating mental illness characterized by a loss of contact with
reality, personality disorders, mood symptoms, sensorimotor and cognitive impairments (DSM-5).
This clinical disorganization and cognitive deficits are associated with abnormal anatomo-functional
connectivity and disturbances in neural oscillations and synchrony in highly-distributed brain networks,
including thalamus-related circuits [3–11]. Schizophrenia has a multifactorial etiology involving genetic,

Brain Sci. 2017, 7, 34

neurodevelopmental, environmental and socio–cultural factors [12–15]. Therefore, the neurobiology
of schizophrenia remains elusive. Its complex and multifactorial symptomatology has been
driving multiple lines of research with diverse (genetic, immunological, metabolic, neurochemical,
neurophysiological) hypotheses.
Most of the patients suffering from schizophrenia are treated with a combination of non-biological
therapies (cognitive remediation, psychotherapies) and antipsychotic medications. These drugs
are more effective against the positive than the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, and
they induce serious adverse effects [16,17]. Because schizophrenia is characterized by multiple
etiopathophysiological factors, does it make sense to have a treatment based principally on
a “single receptor”? There is increasing evidence that the psychiatric disorders and the cognitive
deﬁcits of patients with schizophrenia are associated with and may be caused by dysfunction of
highly-distributed systems displaying disturbed spatiotemporal activity patterns. Moreover, a recent
meta-analysis demonstrated signiﬁcant changes in whole brain network architecture associated with
schizophrenia [18]. This supports the notion of functional interactions between multiple molecular,
cellular and system pathways, which contribute to the multiple symptoms and cognitive deﬁcits in
schizophrenia [19]. So, would it not be more promising to use a therapeutic means that non-speciﬁcally
modulates the ongoing global brain activity such as to re-establish normal brain function? The rationale
behind the use of a non-speciﬁc therapeutic means in patients with schizophrenia is that the return
to their normal brain function may especially alleviate the psychiatric disorders and dampen their
emotion, sensorimotor and cognitive deﬁcits. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) may be a promising
alternative [20]. The challenge is immense given the complex symptomatology and pathophysiological
mechanisms of schizophrenia (see below).
Davidson and colleagues [21] wrote: “To achieve the best therapeutic results in schizophrenia—like
most other disorders—primary prevention is preferable to early and prompt treatment, which, in turn,
is preferable to treatment of chronically established illness”. This raises the questions when to apply the
preventive treatment and what could be the appropriate treatment modality? Ideally, assuming that
schizophrenia is caused by an aggressive agent (microbe, virus, parasite) during pregnancy, it would
be great to have the infection type identiﬁed to proceed to the appropriate preventive asymptomatic
treatment [22,23]. Moreover, there is increasing evidence suggesting that maternal immune stimulation
during pregnancy can increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia [24–26].
Prenatal infection may lead to a developmental neuroinﬂammation, which would contribute to the
disruption of the normal brain development leading to dysfunctional networks and abnormal behavior
relevant to schizophrenia [27]. The corresponding neuroimmune and behavioral abnormalities might
occur in response to stress in puberty [27,28]. Rodent models of maternal immune activation mimic
both behavioral and neurobiological abnormalities, which are relevant to schizophrenia [28–31].
Interestingly, an early presymptomatic anti-inﬂammatory intervention during peripubertal stress
exposure can prevent the schizophrenia-relevant behavioral and neurobiological abnormalities [28].
Nevertheless, there is a real need to treat high-risk patients for whom the causes of their mental state
remain unknown. That is why in the present review, I will present a neurophysiological perspective
on a preventive symptomatic treatment in patients with premorbid and/or prodromal manifestations
and bioelectrical markers of latent schizophrenia.
A universal property of brain networks is to produce electric currents, conveyed by the
movement of ions across cellular membranes, whatever the pathophysiological context may
be. Moreover, both the normal and the unhealthy brain can generate normal and abnormal
brain rhythms [32]. Importantly, almost every cognitive task is associated with event-related
electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations [33]. We will see that disturbances in brain rhythms
are common in patients with schizophrenia. So, can exogenous electricity correct or re-normalize
abnormal brain oscillations and, in parallel or as a result, the related mental, emotional, sensorimotor
and cognitive disorders? Numerous clinical interventions have demonstrated the beneﬁts of brain

111

Brain Sci. 2017, 7, 34

electrical stimulation methods in patients with neurobiological disorders resistant to available
pharmacological treatments.
There is increasing evidence that exogenous electric currents can modulate not only brain
electrical activity but also behavioral and cognitive performance, giving hope for treating complex
neuropsychiatric illnesses. Moreover, schizophrenia patients with auditory hallucinations that are
unresponsive to antipsychotic medications can be treated with transcranial magnetic stimulation
(TMS) [34,35] or transcranial electric stimulation (TES) [36–40]. Ongoing research aims to develop
such noninvasive neurophysiological therapies as a routine therapy [40–42], which may be more
promising than DBS (see below). The exponents of noninvasive technologies now face a huge challenge
to develop and reﬁne an efﬁcient therapeutic, free of side-effects, neurophysiological method that
treats schizophrenia in its entirety, that is, to treat all its core features, including positive, negative and
mood symptoms, and the decline in cognitive abilities (memory and thinking skills). Although there is
accumulating evidence that TES techniques are reliable and versatile therapeutic options, a certain
number of questions remains open regarding their anatomical targets and the neural mechanisms
underlying their clinical impact.
The development of the chronic character of schizophrenia takes years following the occurrence of
prodromal symptoms with cognitive declines and ﬁrst-episode psychosis [43–45]. Longitudinal studies
in at-risk mental state individuals and the duration of untreated psychosis offer a time window to
identify predictive biomarkers, to better understand the etiopathophysiology of schizophrenia and to
develop innovative therapies [44]. It would be ideal to have a therapeutic neurophysiological modality,
for instance, a weak TES (see below) applied in at-risk individuals, capable of stopping the occurrence
of ﬁrst-episode psychosis and chronic schizophrenia. This exciting idea has already received increasing
interest during at least the last two decades [43,46–48].
Electro- and magneto-encephalographic oscillations are natural bioelectrical markers of the
functional and dysfunctional state of brain networks [4,49]. Spontaneously-occurring gamma frequency
(30–80 Hz) oscillations (GFO) of cortical origin, naturally implicated in attention and integration
processes, are excessively ampliﬁed not only during hallucinations [50–53] but also in ﬁrst-episode
psychosis and in at-risk mental states for psychosis [54–57]. Such abnormally ampliﬁed GFO can
be reproduced after a single systemic administration, at a psychotomimetic dose, of the glutamate
N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist ketamine in the corticothalamic (CT) systems
of healthy humans [58] and rodents [59–62]. These translational models of ﬁrst-episode psychosis
highlight one important factor, glutamate synaptic transmission, which may be altered in individuals
at high risk of developing psychotic disorders [63]. Also, disturbances in sleep and reductions in
EEG sleep spindles in ﬁrst-episode psychosis and early-onset schizophrenia [3,64–67] support the
hypothesis that the thalamus plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.
Therefore, in the present essay, I put forward the notion that the CT pathway, the thalamus,
and glutamate synaptic transmission might together represent the backbone etiopathophysiological
mechanism of chronic psychotic disorders. This mainstay mechanism may be a prime target for early
therapeutic intervention using TES techniques, more speciﬁcally targeting the CT pathway. First of
all, I will start with a discussion about possible anatomical targets for late therapeutic electrical
stimulation in patients with advanced schizophrenia. Then, I will provide an overview of therapeutic
neurophysiological procedures and will develop a theoretical proposal on how we may understand
the mechanisms underlying the effects of TES of the cerebral cortex with a focus on the CT pathway.
It is worth specifying that, in the present survey, the rodent is our predilection animal since its neural
networks share common anatomo-functional properties with those of humans.
2. Is There an Anatomical Target for Advanced Schizophrenia?
It is extremely challenging to ﬁnd the correct or best anatomical target(s) for the use of
invasive or non–invasive electrical stimulation of brain networks as last resort treatment of
complex mental-health disorders, such as schizophrenia. For instance, low-frequency TMS of

112

Brain Sci. 2017, 7, 34

the left temporoparietal cortex can reduce positive symptoms, especially self-reported auditory
hallucinations [34,68,69]. Although there is evidence that TMS can enhance cortical synchrony, improve
cognitive performance [70,71], and is safe and free of cognitive side-effects, further investigations are
however required to identify both the anatomical target(s) and the stimulation settings that would
lead to an efﬁcient treatment against both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia [72,73].
In contrast, applying DBS at the seemingly best anatomical target might not be free of side-effects.
For instance, it is well known that DBS treatment in the subthalamic nucleus can not only alleviate
essential and Parkinson disease tremors but also reduce symptoms in patients suffering from severe
forms of obsessive compulsive disorders, providing encouraging ﬁndings that are corroborated by
animal studies [74]. Even if the subthalamic nucleus might be an effective target for the treatment of
behavioral disorders that include emotional, cognitive, and motor impairments [75], its use in patients
experiencing severe psychiatric disorders with limited therapeutic options remains questionable.
Patients who severely suffer from advanced psychiatric disorders, and who are refractory to
medication, must beneﬁt from a new efﬁcient therapeutic approach, and DBS may be a promising
alternative. Goodman and Insel [20] recently put emphasis on the fact that the pace of DBS being
used against seriously advanced neuropsychiatric disorders is accelerating, giving the incentive both
basic and clinical researchers need to concentrate their efforts on the road ahead. However, are we
actually ready to use DBS against severe and ultra-complex mental-health disorders? Schizophrenia,
as a typical example, is a multidimensional and multifactorial illness, raising an important question as
to whether or not DBS could alleviate both the negative and the positive symptoms in all schizophrenic
patients who urgently need a new effective therapy [76]. Could both the anatomical target and
the DBS settings used in any speciﬁc patient be also generally applied to other very problematic
patients? The challenge is immense because of the existence of several types of schizophrenia [77].
Finding a unique effective therapy against all types of schizophrenia presupposes that they all share
common etiopathophysiological mechanisms. In psychiatry, DBS may be effective in combination with
commendable clinical practices [78,79]. Therefore, the use of non–human animal and network models
remain a versatile means to develop therapeutic concepts and to understand the neural mechanisms of
electrical neuromodulation used in diverse interventions.
Reliable and reproducible non-human animal models of schizophrenia do not exist, and
any model for schizophrenia remains questionable with its strengths and limitations [80–83].
Indeed, schizophrenia belongs to a group of hyper-complex mental-health disorders. So, how to
model the heterogeneity of the causes, the progression, the multiple clinical symptoms of chronic
schizophrenia, and of the changes elicited by years of medication? The critical problem in ﬁnding
an efﬁcient treatment of schizophrenia is due to the challenge in modeling psychiatric disorders, which
depends on the lack of information about their etiology and pathophysiology.
So, what would be a “good” model of or for advanced schizophrenia (untreatable using the
currently available therapeutic means) suitable to develop a therapeutic concept based on the use of
invasive or noninvasive electrical stimulation of the appropriate neural networks? In theory, one may
believe that an animal model that is not validated as being a good model for schizophrenia but
that is validated as being a good model for a measurable, singular pathophysiological behavioral
trait (e.g., violent behavior, catatonia) similar to that observed in advanced schizophrenic patients
and that often makes it to the headlines of newspapers [84–86], may have an added value to
investigate the efﬁcacy of a therapeutic treatment using DBS in clinical trials. Again, validation of such
a concept (reversal of the behavioral/pathophysiological trait by DBS) should rest on well identiﬁed
anatomo-pathophysiological mechanisms, and they should be conducted along with appropriate
ethical guidelines.
Animal models are, however, all potentially useful as long as they are precisely described,
and as the related working hypotheses are clearly formulated. This critical view is still a matter
of discussion [80,81,83,87,88]. So, along these lines, any model can be a versatile tool to
explore the multiple facets concealed by healthy and sick brains. The challenge is indeed to ﬁnd

113

Brain Sci. 2017, 7, 34

convergences across models and patients, at least in terms of symptoms and neural dysfunction.
Then comes the question of how animal models can be used to discover the appropriate therapy?
Neurodevelopmental rodent models, based on prenatal immune activation, which present at the adult
stage schizophrenia-relevant behavioral and neurobiological abnormalities [89–91], may be promising.
Indeed, it was recently demonstrated that a preventive, presymptomatic anti-inﬂammatory treatment
during peripubertal stress exposure can prevent the abnormal behavior and the biomarkers of the
neuroimmune abnormality [28]. However, there is a real need to ﬁnd an appropriate treatment of
psychosis for high-risk patients for whom the causes of their mental state remain unknown.
Also, if we have known the etiological cause(s) of a given patient suffering from schizophrenia
for many years, would we be able to ﬁnd the appropriate treatment that alleviates simultaneously
the positive and negative symptoms and the cognitive and emotional disorders? For the time being,
we face the absolute necessity to understand the etiology and pathophysiology of schizophrenia
at the molecular, cellular and systems levels, with the dream to ﬁnd an effective, asymptomatic or
symptomatic treatment free of side-effects.
3. Overview of Therapeutic Neurophysiological Procedures: DBS versus TES
Since the middle of the 20th century, invasive and noninvasive neurophysiological approaches
have been attracting increasing interest as means of last resort treatments against advanced neurological
and mental illnesses that are resistant to currently available therapies. Deep brain electrical stimulation
has evolved as an invasive, stereotaxic-guided [92] and neuroimaging-guided [93] neurophysiological
treatment when drug therapy no longer provides relief from symptoms accompanying severe
neurological and psychiatric disorders. It is now used to treat other severe brain disorders in
patients resistant to pharmacological mono- and polytherapy, including Parkinson’s disease [94,95]
epilepsy [96], dystonia [97], obsessive-compulsive disorders [74], pain [98,99], multiple sclerosis [100],
depression [101,102] and Tourette syndrome [103]. It is also used in brain-injured patients in vegetative
and minimally conscious states [104]. Although therapeutic DBS is applied along with the rules of
the art and ethics [105], its use can be accompanied by psychiatric complications [106,107]. The neural
mechanisms underlying the effects of DBS are complex and little known [108,109].
Since the end of the 20th century, TMS has emerged as a tool to study the human brain
and an efﬁcient noninvasive therapeutic means against depression [110], schizophrenia [34,35],
addiction [111] and other neurological and psychiatric disorders [42]. However, there is a need
to optimize the TMS protocols for routine clinical practice. TMS excites or inhibits the activity of
cortical nerve cells and the dynamics and plastic properties of neural networks through the inﬂuence
of electric currents that are induced by changing magnetic ﬁelds. Repetitive TMS modulates in
a frequency-dependent manner the excitability of the cortical circuits [112]. Regarding schizophrenia,
although TMS is efﬁcient in treating auditory hallucinations [34,68,69], a major issue is to ﬁnd the
anatomical target and the TMS settings that allow treating the disease in its entirety, that is, to alleviate
all the negative and positive symptoms, mood disorders and cognitive deﬁcits.
Since the beginning of the 21st century, three principal TES techniques, forms of noninvasive and
less aggressive neurophysiological modulation, have been increasingly used in cognitive neurosciences
and interventional approaches [37,40]: transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), alternating
current stimulation (tACS), and random noise stimulation (tRNS). Transcranial electrical stimulations
safely apply, via scalp electrodes, a weak electrical current to modulate the physiological or pathological
cortical and subcortical activities of healthy subjects or patients suffering from severe mental
disorders [113]. Such TES techniques can modulate synaptic plasticity and related genes [114]. It seems
not yet clear whether the application of TES on the frontal cortex of patients with schizophrenia can
bring signiﬁcant beneﬁcial effects [115]. However, tDCS applied over the left frontotemporal cortex of
schizophrenia patients with disabling treatment-resistant symptoms reduces both the auditory verbal
hallucinations (~30%) and the abnormal resting-state hyperactivity between the left temporoparietal
junction and the anterior insula [116]. When applied to the temporoparietal cortex of schizophrenia

114

Brain Sci. 2017, 7, 34

patients with medication-refractory auditory verbal hallucination, tDCS can not only decrease the
severity of the hallucinations but also ameliorate some negative and positive symptoms [117]. tDCS is
a static current that polarizes the membrane potential of the neuronal elements of the target cortical
volume [118,119] whereas tACS modulates, in a frequency speciﬁc manner (within the EEG frequency
range), ongoing cortical neural oscillations [120,121]. There is increasing evidence that tDCS can induce
memory enhancement in healthy subjects, in patients with psychiatric and neurological disorders,
and in animal models [122]. In contrast to tDCS, tACS can modulate, more directly, not only the
ﬁring of the nerve cells but also their oscillations and synchrony [40]. In a subpopulation of patients
with schizophrenia, tDCS can be efﬁcient in the reduction of refractory verbal hallucinations but
also of positive and negative symptoms [116,117]. Interestingly, an imperceptible alternating current
(peak-to-peak: 750 μA) applied at the gamma frequency (40 Hz) to the frontal cortex can enhance
cognitive performance during logical reasoning [123]. Also, gamma frequency (25–40 Hz) tACS applied
on the frontotemporal cortex of subjects during REM sleep inﬂuences ongoing brain activity and
induces conscious awareness, making it possible for the dreamer to be lucid of his or her dream and to
have control of its content [124]. Gamma frequency oscillations are well known to be prevalent during
REM sleep [125]. It was recently shown that gamma tACS of the human motor cortex increases motor
performance during a visuomotor task [126]. Concurrent functional magnetic resonance imaging has
revealed neural activity changes underneath the stimulation electrode and in related brain networks,
including the prefrontal cortex [126]. On the other hand, alpha frequency (10 Hz) tACS applied over
the occipitoparietal cortex reduced cognitive performance in a visual task [127]. The effects of tACS
on brain network oscillations and on behavior are critically discussed in a comprehensive review
article [128]. tRNS is an alternating current stimulation technique with a wide-band stimulation
frequency (up to 640 Hz) [129]. It has been shown to increase neuroplasticity during perceptual
learning [130].
In summary, TES techniques appear promising for clinical interventions. They are safer than
DBS techniques and less expensive than TMS. TES is also more appropriate than DBS as a
preventive treatment modality against schizophrenia because it is noninvasive and almost free
of side-effects. In addition, the efﬁcacy of TES techniques to modulate brain activities and to
inﬂuence cognitive performance have been demonstrated. The mechanisms underlying their effects,
however, remain still elusive. Also, more research and clinical trials are necessary to attain, during
routine clinical practice, consistent beneﬁts for patients suffering from debilitating mental illnesses.
Importantly, emerging clinical interventions have shown that TES therapeutic modalities can reduce
essential tremors in patients suffering from Parkinson’s disease [131,132]. So, one can easily imagine
that the noninvasive and low-cost TES techniques might supplant invasive DBS methods.
4. Three Candidates for Preventive TES
As mentioned above, it is extremely challenging to make a decision for a late therapeutic
neurophysiological intervention in treatment-resistant advanced schizophrenia. The development of
chronic forms of schizophrenia takes years after the occurrence of prodromal symptoms, cognitive declines
and first-episode psychosis [45,133–138]. So, would it be possible to prevent or to delay the progressive
development of chronic schizophrenia? Early therapeutic intervention is a notion that has been around
with increasing interest during the last two decades [44,46,47,139]. Indeed, the complex symptomatology
of schizophrenia results from progressive abnormalities of brain networks, including the thalamus with its
reciprocal connections with the cerebral cortex [11,140–142]. Even if cognitive impairments are relatively
modest during the prodromal phase of schizophrenia [137,143], efficient early therapeutic intervention
could stop or delay the onset of psychotic disorders, which might otherwise lead to further cognitive
damage and impaired daily functioning [144–146].
A preventive treatment against schizophrenia of course requires a better understanding
of the evolution of the clinical disorganization and of the cognitive changes that can be
observed from premorbid to ﬁrst-episode psychosis [136,143,147]. The great challenge is to

115

Brain Sci. 2017, 7, 34

identify the time window when the very ﬁrst clinical symptoms and cognitive declines start
to occur in individuals who will actually develop schizophrenia [143]. The “primary” factor(s)
responsible for the progressive neural changes leading to chronic forms of schizophrenia remain
to be identiﬁed. Whatever the preventive neurophysiological therapy implies, it should target
an etiopathophysiological mechanism that is at the root of the mental disorders. Multiple diverse
(genetic, epigenetic, neurodevelopmental, immunological, environmental, socio-cultural) factors are
thought to be (either in isolation or through interactions), the cause of schizophrenia [14,148–155].
This is a long–standing debate that is not discussed in the present essay. Here, I highlight recent
ﬁndings supporting the glutamate neurotransmission hypothesis of schizophrenia, which implicates
critical etiopathophysiological mechanisms that appear early during its progressive development.
Here, it is assumed that these processes are common to several types of chronic schizophrenia during
the prodromal phase.
Glutamate is one of the main neurotransmitters of the thalamus, an essential subcortical structure
involved in sensory discrimination, motor and cognitive processes. It is worth mentioning that
more than 80% of the thalamic neurons are glutamatergic and they are massively innervated by
the CT neurons, which are also glutamatergic [156]. Importantly, there is compelling evidence
that multiple and diverse abnormalities (glutamate receptors, transporters and associated proteins;
NMDAR–associated intracellular signaling proteins, and glutamatergic enzymes) related to the
glutamate transmission have been found in the thalamus of patients with schizophrenia [157].
Furthermore, in the following, we describe compelling evidence that the pathogenesis of ﬁrst–episode
psychosis can be better modeled translationally than chronic forms of schizophrenia. Therefore, we will
also demonstrate that the thalamus might be an interesting target for TES, directly and indirectly
via the glutamatergic CT pathway, designed for early therapeutic intervention against ﬁrst-episode
psychosis and chronic forms of schizophrenia.
4.1. The Corticothalamic Pathway and the Thalamus
The thalamus, located around the third ventricle, is reciprocally connected with the cerebral cortex
and it receives inputs from the cerebellum, the basal ganglia, the brainstem and basal forebrain [158].
The thalamus is an essential relay and plays an integrative role for ongoing and function-related
cortical activities [159]. It relays information to multiple regions of the cerebral cortex in a bottom-up
(from the external world via the sensory receptors) and a top-down (from the cerebral cortex) fashion.
During sensory discrimination, sensorimotor integration and cognitive processes, the information
circulates along the glutamatergic CT and thalamocortical (TC) pathways [160]. The thalamus is
implicated in multiple functions: sensory perception (visual, somatosensory, auditory), sleep, wakefulness
(through the ascending activating system), pain, attention and consciousness [156]. It is also implicated in
many neurological and psychiatric diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson disease, epilepsy,
schizophrenia, autism, bipolar disorders, chronic pain and major depression. Damage to the thalamus can
cause very long-lasting (>3 years) or permanent coma [161,162]. The thalamus is also the anatomical target
of therapeutic DBS methods [104,163,164]. The specific prethalamic (or peripheral) inputs of the sensory
systems innervate both the specific or first-order (primary sensory) and the non-specific or higher-order
(associative and cognitive) thalamic nuclei. First- and higher-order thalamic nuclei relay information to
the granular and the supra- and infragranular layers of the neocortex, respectively [160].
TC neurons, the principal neurons of the thalamus, are glutamatergic and their axon
relays thalamically processed signals to the cerebral cortex (Figure 1A). In contrast to the CT
pyramidal neurons, the TC neurons do not communicate with each other. The TC axons give
rise to en passant collaterals in the GABAergic thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN)—a thin layer
that covers the lateral walls of the dorsal thalamus—which is the principal source of GABA
receptor-mediated inhibition of TC neurons [165]. The TC-related information is also computed in
vertical (within the cortical column) and horizontal (between columns) cortical networks, linked with
other cortical (distant areas) and subcortical structures (e.g., striatum, amygdala, and hippocampus;

116

Brain Sci. 2017, 7, 34

Figure 1B). Intracortically-computed information reaches the thalamus via CT axons. Thereby, both the
thalamus and the cerebral cortex work together in concert through their topographically organized
reciprocal connections, which form intermingled feed-forward and closed-loop CT-TC circuits [156,166].
The CT pathways are of two types, one originating in layer V and the other in layer VI.

Figure 1. The principal anatomical features of the rodent cortico-reticulo-thalamocortical (CT-TRN-TC)
system. This is the principal CT-TRN-TC system that is common to ﬁrst- and higher-order thalamic
nuclei. (A) Mounting of reconstructed juxtacellularly-labelled neurons of the rat primary somatosensory
system. Both the CT (in green) and the TC (in blue) neurons are glutamatergic (glu) and their principal
axon crosses the TRN where it gives rise to axon collaterals. The TRN neuron is GABAergic (gaba)
and innervates only the TC neurons of the dorsal thalamus principally through lateral inhibition.
(B) In this schematic drawing of this 3-neuron circuit, the principal afferents (bg, basal ganglia; cb,
cerebellar; sens, sensory) and efferents of the dorsal thalamus are indicated, the TRN being part of the
ventral thalamus.

The GABAergic TRN is an inhibitory interface strategically located between the thalamus and
the neocortex [165,167]. It is innervated by glutamatergic TC and layer VI CT inputs (Figures 1 and 2).
TRN cells have dendro-dendritic synapses to communicate among each other [168–171] (Figure 2).
The TRN is also characterized by an important intrinsic network of chemical (GABAergic) and
electrical synapses [172,173], which can effectively be inﬂuenced by the layer VI CT pathway [174–176].
The hodology and the innervation pattern of the CT-TRN-TC circuit strongly indicate that the
GABAergic TRN neurons are implicated in both top-down and bottom-up processing, suggesting
that the TRN might play a central role in attentional processes [165]. Moreover, lesions of the TRN
lead to attentional deﬁcit [177,178]. Their axonal projections are topographically organized and form
open-loop connections with the related TC neurons, the anatomical substrate of lateral inhibition in the
thalamus [179,180]. Thereby, TRN neurons can modulate, in a coordinated fashion, the TC activities
that are relevant for attention and integration processes. In schizophrenia, disorders of thalamic lateral
inhibition are thought to disturb the pattern of TC activity on the way to the cerebral cortex [8,181].
Importantly, GABAergic TRN neurons are endowed with powerful oscillatory properties (see below).
The layer V CT pathway selectively innervates the higher-order thalamic nuclei in a focal manner
(like a driver input). Like the peripheral inputs, it does not innervate the TRN, in contrast to the layer
VI CT pathway. This layer V CT pathway is an essential element in cortico-cortical (or transthalamic)
circuits, which parallel direct cortico–cortical connections [159]. The principal axon of layer V CT
neurons also innervates motor centers in the brainstem and spinal cord. The axonal branch that
innervates the thalamus conveys corollary discharges used to modulate imminent sensorimotor
117

Brain Sci. 2017, 7, 34

processing [159,182,183]. In fact, corollary discharges might be disturbed in schizophrenia [184–186].
Both layer V and VI CT pathways are assumed to work together in synergy from the very ﬁrst stages
of sensorimotor processing up to subsequent higher cognitive and motor processes.

Figure 2. The layer VI corticothalamic (CT) neurons outnumber the thalamocortical (TC) neurons
by a factor 10. As a consequence, the glutamatergic CT neurons exert a widespread and powerful
excitatory inﬂuence on the ﬁrst- and higher-order thalamic nuclei. Layer VI CT axons innervate other
layer VI CT neurons via recurrent axon collaterals. In contrast, the glutamatergic TC neurons do not
communicate among each other. The GABAergic TRN cells use dendro-dendritic chemical (d-d) and
electrical (gj, gap-junction) synapses to communicate among each other.

The layer VI CT pathway plays an essential role in attentional and integrative
processes [8,187–189]. This CT pathway innervates the TRN and the related ﬁrst- and higher-order
thalamic nuclei [156,159]. This pathway exerts a massive (about ten–fold stronger than the
corresponding TC pathway) [190] and regional innervation within large thalamic territories (Figure 2).
Cortical layer VI contains a heterogeneous population of neurons [191–193]. The layer VI CT pathway
is the major glutamatergic output, which is reciprocally connected with TC neurons [188,194].
Layer VI CT apical dendrites and axon collaterals terminate in layer III–IV [188,193]. Their axon
collaterals are implicated in both excitatory and inhibitory feedback mechanisms in layer IV [195,196].
Layer VI CT axons innervate other layer VI CT neurons [197,198]. Their apical dendrites can perform
active integration of synaptic inputs via dendritic spiking [199]. There is anatomical evidence that
some dendritic spines of neocortical pyramidal neurons are simultaneously innervated by GABAergic
and glutamatergic inputs from local–circuit cells and TC neurons, respectively [200]. Thereby these
GABAergic inputs can gate the synaptic impact of the incoming TC inputs on the pyramidal neurons.
Layer VI CT neurons mediate most of their excitatory neuronal transmissions through the activation
of ionotropic (NMDA and AMPA) and metabotropic glutamate receptors in both the cortex and
the thalamus [201]. Interestingly, Layer VI CT neurons innervate not only the thalamus but also
cortical layer IV, suggesting that layer VI CT neurons exert a dual, intrathalamic and intracortical,
118

Brain Sci. 2017, 7, 34

feedback control of incoming TC activities [159,202]. Such a cortical feedback would have a facilitatory
effect on the thalamus [203]. Thereby, the spatiotemporal dynamics of intracortical synaptic and
intrinsic processes, especially in layer VI dendrites, are under the inﬂuence of the dialogue between
the corresponding CT and TC neurons.
In the thalamus, NMDAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents are much larger in
CT than in prethalamic (sensory inputs) synapses [204–206]. Importantly, the corresponding
NMDAR-related response is antagonized by the NMDAR antagonist ketamine or MK-801 [207],
which signiﬁcantly increases the power, and the synchrony, of ongoing GFO in the highly-distributed
CT-TC systems [59–62]. Moreover, the CT pathway signiﬁcantly contributes to thalamic GFO [59,208].
The layer VI CT pathway also exerts a great inﬂuence on the state of the membrane potential of
the TC neurons, as well as on ongoing and function-related thalamic activities. More speciﬁcally,
the CT neurons shape the spatiotemporal receptive ﬁelds of TC cells [209,210] and play an essential
role in the coordination of widespread coherent oscillations [211]. Importantly, the CT innervation,
mediated by both NMDA and non-NMDA receptors [212], is more effective to the TRN than to
TC neurons [174]. In the TRN, the CT pathway involves not only monosynaptic excitations but
also disynaptic and polysynaptic GABA(A)-mediated inhibitions [176]. Thereby, the layer VI CT
pathway and the TRN work together as an attentional searchlight (focused attention) to salient
sensory stimuli [165,213–215]. There is a large body of comprehensive anatomo-functional studies
showing that CT neurons exert a simultaneous effect on both the center (excitation) and the surround
(suppressive) of receptive ﬁelds [189,215–218]. The CT synapses would thus exert a crucial role in
sharpening the thalamic receptive ﬁeld via intensifying both the center and the surround mechanisms.
The CT inﬂuence is dynamic with an excitation-inhibition balance changing in an activity-dependent
manner [205]. Sustained cortical activity enhances thalamic activities, such as during states of focused
attention [219,220]. Finally, CT neurons are thought to function similarly across species and across
sensory modalities [218].
Thalamic rhythms: The thalamus plays a crucial role in the generation of brain rhythms [221,222]
and it is implicated in a wide range of brain oscillations [223–225]. Indeed, the thalamic neurons
are endowed with state-, time- and voltage-dependent properties, under the control of synaptic
inputs, which allow them to ﬁre a single action potential or a high-frequency (up to 600 Hz)
burst of two to seven action potentials. The ﬁring mode, tonic or bursting, is determined by
low–threshold T-type calcium channels. They are inactivated at a membrane potential more positive
than −60 mV and de-inactivated below for more negative values. This means that for a membrane
potential hyperpolarized below −60 mV, any intrinsic depolarization or depolarizing input, including
a reversed inhibitory postsynaptic potential, can trigger a low–threshold potential crowned by
a high-frequency burst of action potentials. In short, when the T channels are inactive, the thalamic
neurons ﬁre in a tonic manner; they ﬁre in the burst mode when the T channels are de-inactivated.
These electrophysiological properties have been characterized in detail in a countless number of
publications (for review see, e.g., [226–228]).
The GABAergic TRN cells are also endowed with state- and voltage-dependent pacemaker
properties not only at the spindle frequency (7–12 Hz) [229–231] but also at the gamma frequency [232]
oscillations. Indeed, the membrane of the GABAergic TRN neurons can generate intrinsic subthreshold
and threshold GFO, which result in rhythmic GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic
potentials in related TC neurons [232]. The oscillating properties of TRN and TC neurons are inﬂuenced
by the CT pathway [59,205,208,233,234]. Therefore, the TRN plays a key role in the state-dependent
generation of thalamic GFO, which are under the powerful control of large populations of layer
VI CT neurons.
In schizophrenia, the thalamus and its related networks present diverse (structural, chemical,
physiological and metabolic) abnormalities [5,7,11,140,235–238]. Volumetric and structural studies
using imaging have revealed a reduction in the volume of the thalamus not only in chronic
schizophrenia [239] but also in ﬁrst-episode psychosis and in antipsychotic-naive high-risk individuals

119

Brain Sci. 2017, 7, 34

for psychosis [240]. These structural changes may be linked to a functional dysconnectivity between
the thalamus and the cerebral cortex in both early and chronic stages of psychosis, which is associated
with cognitive impairment [10,135,241–243]. A decrease of the thalamic glutamate level has also
been measured [244,245], and almost all molecules implicated in the glutamate transmission pathway
are altered in the thalamus of patients with schizophrenia (changes in the expression of glutamate
receptors, transporters and associated proteins) [157]. The thalamic glutamate level, measured with
the use of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, might also be a predictor of psychosis [244,245].
In ﬁrst-episode and early–onset schizophrenia patients, disturbances in sleep represent a core
pathophysiological feature. Cortical EEG studies conducted in such patients have revealed a signiﬁcant
deﬁcit in sleep spindles, a marker of functional dysconnectivity [3,246]. This might be due to a reduced
function of NMDAR, as an in vitro study, conducted in thalamic slices, demonstrated that a selective
blockade of NMDAR or a diminished extracellular magnesium concentration signiﬁcantly shortens
spindle-like oscillations [247]. However, we do not know whether the reduction in sleep spindles in
patients with schizophrenia is due to a presynaptic and/or postsynaptic dysfunction of TC or TRN
neurons. It is tempting to speculate that the functional dysconnectivity recorded in schizophrenia also
involves a reduction of NMDAR activity. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that, in rodents,
the NMDAR antagonist ketamine, at a psychotomimetic dose, disrupts the functional state of the
CT pathway [59].
In summary, the thalamic volume and glutamate level, sleep spindles and ongoing GFO
are potentially useful biomarkers for the clinician to diagnose the prodromal phase of psychosis.
Therefore, the thalamus with its structural, neurochemical and electrophysiological properties seems
an essential structure in the etiopathophysiology of schizophrenia, as well as a prime target structure
for preventive TES, directly and indirectly via the CT pathway.
4.2. Glutamatergic Transmission
In the light of our current knowledge, the term “glutamate hypothesis” mean that schizophrenia is
caused by multiple variables and a stream of pathophysiological processes related to NMDAR–related
synaptic functions [248,249]. NMDAR are well known to play, by means of synaptic plasticity,
an essential role in the adequate neurodevelopment of cognitive abilities [250]. Here, the glutamate
hypothesis does not negate the dopamine hypothesis and the other pathophysiological hypotheses of
schizophrenia. Moreover, the disturbed dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmissions might be
causally related [44,251–253].
Glutamate is the predominant neurotransmitter in the brain. It is the precursor of GABA, the most
prevalent inhibitory neurotransmitter that balances glutamate’s actions. Glutamate works with ion
channel–associated (ionotropic) or G protein–coupled (metabotropic) receptors. It is also well known
that NMDARs play, by means of synaptic plasticity, an essential role in the adequate neurodevelopment
of cognitive abilities [250]. Since 1980, there have been increasing lines of evidence suggesting that
glutamate-based synaptic neurotransmission is altered in schizophrenia [254–256]. Kim and colleagues
(1980) measured a decrease of glutamate in the cerebrospinal ﬂuid of an untreated patient with
schizophrenia. Then, studies performed on postmortem human brain samples demonstrated changes
in glutamate receptor binding, transcription and subunit protein expression in the prefrontal cortex
and subcortical structures, including the thalamus and hippocampus [257]. They also showed altered
levels of the amino acids N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) and N-acetyl aspartyl glutamate (NAAG) and
of the activity of the enzyme that cleaves NAA to NAAG and glutamate in the cerebral spinal ﬂuid
and postmortem tissues from patients suffering from schizophrenia [258,259]. Also, genetic studies
have revealed that a majority of genes associated with schizophrenia are linked to the glutamatergic
system [248,260–263]. Interestingly, an imaging study (SPECT tracer for the NMDAR) revealed
a reduction in NMDAR binding in the hippocampus of medication–free patients [264]. Even when
considering the possibility that schizophrenia is caused by an immune dysfunction due to infectious
agents, a link is identiﬁed between immune alterations and disturbances of glutamate NMDA

120

Brain Sci. 2017, 7, 34

receptors [153,265]. Interestingly, there is a growing body of ﬁndings indicating that glutamate synaptic
transmission is signiﬁcantly altered in schizophrenia since the premorbid phase [244,245,254,265–267].
A systemic single dose administration of non–competitive NMDAR antagonists
(phencyclidine, ketamine or MK-801) elicits cognitive deficits and schizophreniform symptoms in
healthy individuals and greatly exacerbates the symptoms in patients with schizophrenia [268–274].
The ketamine–induced schizophreniform symptoms are associated with a state of functional
cortical–subcortical hyperconnectivity [275,276] and an abnormal amplification of baseline GFO,
reminiscent of the increased GFO observed during hallucinations [50–53] and in at-risk mental
state individuals for psychosis (untreated with ketamine) [56]. These clinical neurophysiological
findings were predicted by comprehensive preclinical studies conducted in acute ketamine rodent
models [60,62,277–280].
In summary, disturbances in glutamate synaptic transmission, involving a reduced function of
NMDAR with multiple functional consequences, start to appear early during the development of
schizophrenia. This may cause the dysfunctional neural plasticity in schizophrenia [281]. A certain number
of genes (DISC-1, dysbindin, SHANK, and NRG-1) are well-known to modulate NMDAR-mediated
glutamate transmission [282,283]. This notion is supported by patients with an autoimmune encephalitis
because they produce antibodies against NMDAR and have a clinical disorganization that is similar to
that of patients with schizophrenia [284]. Therefore, glutamate transmission appears a potential “primary”
target for an early therapeutic intervention [285,286]. Of importance, the psychosis-relevant abnormal
amplification of GFO is reliably reproduced in healthy humans and rodents under the acute influence
of the NMDAR antagonist ketamine at a psychotomimetic dose [58,60]. So, these translational acute
pharmacological models seem appropriate to develop an innovative preventive treatment against the
development of chronic psychotic disorders. It is well recognized that reduced function of NMDAR is a
crucial factor for the progression and symptoms of schizophrenia [284]. It is tempting to posit that an
appropriate preventive treatment would correct the dysfunctional brain network plasticity.
5. Gamma Frequency (30–80 Hz) Oscillations, a Potential Pathophysiological and Therapeutic
Bioelectrical Marker
In the present essay, I put emphasis on GFO because there is compelling evidence of functional
links between GFO, NMDAR hypofunction and a reduction in the number and the function of
cortical GABAergic interneurons in schizophrenia [287–290]. This implies that GFO are considered
a common denominator of the above–presented three facets (CT pathway, thalamus, and glutamate
transmission), which represent the etiopathophysiological backbone for premorbid, acute and chronic
psychotic disorders. Indeed, (i) coherent GFO are recorded not only in the neocortex but also in
the related thalamus; (ii) the layer VI CT pathway contributes to thalamic GFO; and (iii) GFO
increase in amplitude and power not only during hallucinations, in at-risk individuals for psychosis,
but also after the administration, at a psychotomimetic dose, of the NMDAR antagonist ketamine. It is
worth remembering that, in humans, GFO start to emerge several months after birth [291]. It was
demonstrated that, during rodent neural development, thalamic GFO play a crucial role in the mapping
of the functional TC modules [292]. Both in humans and rodents, GFO are simultaneously present in
cortex and thalamus [59,293]. In the following, we will see that GFO are also potential bioelectrical
markers of psychosis, which could be used for the development of therapeutic interventions.
Coherent synchronized GFO emerge in large-scale cortical-subcortical networks spontaneously or
during global brain operations such as attention, perception, and memory [294–297]. They are thought
to play an essential role in synaptic plasticity [298], spatiotemporal coding (binding by synchronization),
storage and recall of information [299–303]. Network GFO are ubiquitous and operate in combination
with other brain rhythms [224,304,305]. Extracellular ﬁeld GFO principally result from subthreshold,
synaptic and intrinsic membrane potential oscillations that trigger action potentials at a precise
phase during the oscillatory period. Their functions and mechanisms are still a matter of debate.

121

Brain Sci. 2017, 7, 34

The functional interactions between GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons are thought to be
responsible for the generation of GFO during attention and integration processes [304,306].
There is accumulating evidence that, in schizophrenia, the dysfunctional network connectivity
between cerebral cortex and thalamus is accompanied by disturbances in GFO and by deﬁcits
in sensorimotor and cognitive performance [4,53,307–309]. There is also evidence of a correlation
between schizophrenia–related symptoms and in particular cognitive and perceptual deﬁcits with
disturbances in cortical GFO [310–312], also in ﬁrst-episode schizophrenia [6]. Gamma oscillations may
be considered not only as neurophysiological markers of the functional state of brain networks
but also as trait markers in schizophrenia [313]. Of importance, abnormally increased GFO are
recorded in patients with ﬁrst-episode schizophrenia [6,54,55,314,315] and in at-risk mental state
patients for psychosis. Gamma oscillations are also abnormally excessive in amplitude during
hallucinations [50–53]. Increased GFO are associated more with positive (such as hallucinations)
than negative symptoms [4,316]. Therefore, hypersynchronized GFO look like a predictive bioelectrical
marker for both psychosis and treatment outcome.
As reported above, such abnormally ampliﬁed GFO can consistently be reproduced in healthy
humans and rodents following the systemic administration at a psychotomimetic dose of the
NMDAR antagonist ketamine [58,60,317]. These translational acute ketamine models, which model
the prodromal phase of psychotic disorders and ﬁrst–episode psychosis, are thus appealing to work
out a preventive treatment against the occurrence of chronic forms of schizophrenia. It may be worth
specifying that a single low-dose (<10 mg/kg) application of ketamine in rats increases hyperfrontality,
which can also be observed in ﬁrst–episode schizophrenia [275,276,318]. In contrast, hypofrontality is
diagnosed in patients with chronic schizophrenia. Therefore, the acute ketamine model may be more
appropriate to mimic the pathogenesis of acute psychotic states in humans [268,271,273,275,276,317].
Abnormally ampliﬁed GFO in neural networks may contribute to the disruption of the integration
of task–relevant information, which is part of psychotic symptoms [55,319]. Moreover, in rodents, a
single systemic administration (at a subanesthetic dose) of ketamine disturbs the functional state
of the somatosensory CT-TRN-TC circuit (Figure 3). Ketamine reliably increases the amplitude
and power of spontaneously-occurring GFO and decreases the amplitude of the sensory-evoked
potential and its related evoked GFO in both the thalamus and the neocortex. In other words,
the NMDAR antagonist ketamine generates persistent and generalized hypersynchrony in GFO,
which act as an aberrant diffuse network noise under these conditions, and represent a potential
electrophysiological correlate of a psychosis-relevant state [60]. Such a generalized network gamma
hypersynchrony thought to create a hyper-attentional state (see discussion in [59]), might be the
force that disrupts the ﬂow of sensorimotor and cognitive processes as observed in schizophrenia.
Thereby, ketamine reduces the ability of the somatosensory CT-TRN-TC system to encode and
integrate incoming information, perhaps by disrupting the center-surround receptive ﬁeld properties
in thalamic neurons [8]. The electrophysiological signals (ongoing and sensory-related potentials
and GFO) appear as valuable neurophysiological markers to test the functional state of neural
networks. Such quantiﬁable bioelectrical markers might thus be a promising translational tool to
develop innovative therapies designed to prevent the occurrence of psychotic disorders. In short,
ketamine decreases the signal-to-noise ratio at least in the CT-TRN-TC system [59,61,320]. Ketamine
also transiently disrupts the expression of long-term potentiation in the TC system [61], disorganizes
action potential ﬁring in rat prefrontal cortex [321], increases the ﬁring in fast-spiking neurons and
decreases it in regular spiking neurons [322] and disturbs sensory-related cortical and thalamic
GFO. Dizocilpine (MK-801) is, like its derivative ketamine, a well-known non-competitive NMDAR
antagonist with psychotomimetic properties leading to similar but more sustained effects than
ketamine [60–62]. It addition, dizocilpine modulates the expression of numerous genes in cortical and
subcortical structures [323].
In summary, neural GFO represent a translational bioelectric marker. It may be considered
a potential prognostic and therapeutic hallmark for cerebral network disorders underlying psychotic

122

Brain Sci. 2017, 7, 34

symptoms. Such a quantiﬁable marker might be a promising translational tool for understanding the
etiopathophysiological mechanisms of psychotic disorders and for developing innovative therapies.
These include, for instance, noninvasive neurophysiological modalities such as TES, applied in at–risk
mental state individuals to prevent the occurrence of ﬁrst–episode psychosis and chronic forms of
psychotic disorders.

Figure 3. The NMDAR antagonist ketamine decreases the ability of the cortico-reticulo-thalamocortical
(CT-TRN-TC) system to integrate incoming information. A single systemic administration of ketamine
disturbs the functional state of the three-neuron circuit (layer VI CT-TRN-TC). Ketamine increases the
amplitude of spontaneously occurring gamma frequency oscillations and decreases the amplitude of
the sensory-evoked potential in both the thalamus and the neocortex. Layer VI CT neurons innervate
the thalamic relay (TC) and reticular (TRN) neurons through the activation of glutamate ionotropic
(NMDA and AMPA) and metabotropic receptors. Ketamine is expected to decrease the NMDA/AMPA
ratio at least at CT synapses. Thereby, ketamine disturbs the mental state and decreases the gamma
signal–to–noise ratio in the CT-TRN-TC system. The sensory-evoked potential (SEP) can be considered
as an index of the sensory-related signal. Adapted from [61] and from [59].

6. Potential Mechanisms of TES
Little is known about the mechanisms underlying the clinical, acute and chronic effects of
TES techniques, which are expected to re-establish the normal functional state in dysfunctional
cortical-subcortical networks and/or to recruit compensatory networks. Whatever the technique
and speciﬁc setting considered, it is difﬁcult to perceive an integrated view of the mechanisms
that are responsible for and contribute to the expected and the observed clinical effects. The possible
mechanisms include genetic, molecular, cellular and systems pathways as well as long-lasting processes
involving plasticity. The nerve cells are embedded in a conductive medium, the extracellular space,
123

Brain Sci. 2017, 7, 34

an important interface between the exogenous and endogenous electric currents and the excitable
and non–excitable elements involved in information processing. In addition, before reaching the
excitable cellular and subcellular elements, the TES-induced electric currents cross several types of
barriers, including the cranium, the meninges, the vascular network and the glial tissue [324–327].
Also, the applied electric ﬁeld has two components, one parallel and the other one perpendicular to
the brain surface [328]. The strength of these two components determines the relative inﬂuence of
TES on the excitability of the neural and non-neuronal elements. All these barriers, as well as the
ongoing changes in the brain state, are a source of interferences with the electric ﬁeld. Taken together,
TES is expected to target a large number of neuronal and glial elements over large cortical and
subcortical regions.
The clinical effects of TES and the underlying short- and long-term mechanisms principally rely on
the electrode type and stimulation parameters (stimulus location, intensity, duration, polarity) [329,330].
The TES effects on brain structures are non-selective, state-dependent [331], and the strongest impact
is not necessarily exerted in neural structures that are located below the electrodes [332]. The TES
effects on the cellular and subcellular excitable elements depend on their geometry and on their spatial
orientation in the electric ﬁeld [332,333]. Both the TES effects and the underlying mechanisms lie
on a continuum of effects ranging from the stimulation settings to the ongoing genetic, molecular,
cellular and network dynamics. The mechanisms underlying the effects of TES are the subject of
intensive research (for a review see: [33,119,334–347]). Our current knowledge remains fragmented
with multiple and diverse proposed mechanisms: conduction block [348], synaptic potentiation or
depression [349–351], network resonance [352], modulation of brain oscillations [127,337,353–359],
of ongoing cellular ﬁring and subthreshold membrane potential oscillations [360,361], of dendritic
inhibition [362], of the astrocytic Ca2+ /IP3 signaling [363] and of the synaptic efﬁcacy in excitatory
and inhibitory pathways [364]. It is reasonable to assume that multiple mechanisms are likely to
operate in combination. The combination of these multiple mechanisms over time can be viewed as
“meta-mechanisms” at the brain-network level.
In the following, I speculate on a few possible mechanisms that may, depending on the TES
modality, be involved in the modulation of the layer VI CT pathway, which massively innervates
both the dorsal thalamus and the TRN. As mentioned above, this glutamatergic pathway may be one
of the prime targets for preventive TES in at-risk mental state individuals for psychotic disorders.
In the present discussion, I take fundamental principles of neurophysiology into consideration.
As the electrical ﬁeld spreads at the speed of light, all neural and non-neural elements will be affected at
the same time. The TES effects are expected to be attenuated with distance, obeying to the rule that the
amount of current delivered by the electrode is proportional to the square of the distance between the
brain elements and the stimulation electrode [365]. Figure 4 illustrates some of the anatomo-functional
elements of the CT-TRN-TC system, which may somehow be impacted by TES electric ﬁelds.
TES entrains neuronal populations: Nerve cells operate on the basis of electrical charges, which makes
them also responsive to weak electric currents [366–370]. Importantly, it was demonstrated that, in the rat,
TES can directly entrain neurons in multiple neocortical areas and sub-neocortical structures, including the
hippocampus [360]. Indeed, some of the cortical and hippocampal neurons were affected at similar phases
of the TES oscillations, suggesting the contribution of non-synaptic mechanisms in the TES-induced direct
entrainment of cortical and subcortical neurons. Of course, the directly activated neurons become a source
for subsequent polysynaptic mechanisms, which represent a significant contribution in TES-induced
entrainment over large cortical territories and the related subcortical structures. The percentage of TES
phase-locked neurons depends on the state of brain networks and increases with TES intensity [360].
Furthermore, intracellular recordings revealed that both the firing and the underlying subthreshold and
suprathreshold membrane potential oscillations are under the combined influence, through amplification,
attenuation or interference, of TES fields and global network activities [360]. The mechanisms underlying
the TES direct effects on ongoing neuronal activity are not well understood.

Figure 4. Potential mechanistic targets in the cortico-reticulo-thalamocortical (CT-TRN-TC) system
for transcranial electrical stimulation. This model includes three parts, which are assumed to work
together: (i) The innervation of the intracortical circuitry by both the descending axonal branches
(top-down process) of the axons running within the molecular layer and the ascending TC inputs
(bottom-up process); (ii) functional interactions between glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons of the
intracortical circuitry, which includes feedback and feedforward excitations (from CT and TC axon
collaterals, respectively); and (iii) the layer VI CT pathway, one of the outputs of the intracortical
circuitry, which innervates simultaneously the thalamic GABAergic reticular (TRN) and glutamatergic
relay (TC) neurons. In this model, the TRN cells generate more lateral than feedback inhibition in the
dorsal thalamus, which contains only TC neurons. The layer VI CT axonal projections are about ten–fold
higher in number than the TC projections, thereby generating a great excitatory pressure on TRN and
TC neurons. Furthermore, the apical dendrites of layer VI pyramidal neurons terminate in layers
III–IV. Each neuron exhibits its own ﬁring pattern that is state-, voltage-, synaptic- and time-dependent.
The action potentials (APs) are drawn like a code bar. Under physiological condition, it is assumed that
the APs are initiated at the axon hillock, the initial segment of the axon. The axon can also transmit,
in addition to APs, analog signals (generated in the somatodendritic domain and represented by
sinusoidal waves) along the axon (at least several hundreds of micrometers away from the soma)
and can modulate AP-evoked transmitter release at the corresponding synapses. In this model, it
is assumed that axodendritic (chemical synapses) and dendrodentritic electrical (via gap junctions)
coupling exist between the two types (basket and chandelier) of GABAergic parvalbumin (PV)
expressing cells. 5-HT, 5-HT3A receptor; CT, corticothalamic; SOM, somatostatin; ssc, spiny stellate
cells; TC, thalamocortical; TRN, thalamic reticular nucleus.

Brain Sci. 2017, 7, 34

The axonal membrane, the more excitable element: The axonal membrane is generally more
excitable than the somatic and dendritic membranes [371–373]. There is increasing evidence supporting
the hypothesis that distal parts of the axon, remote from the axon initial segment, can autonomously
integrate and generate action potentials, which could contribute to the emergence of ﬁeld GFO
involving synchronized GABAergic rhythmic activities [374–378]. So, it is predictable that the
TES–induced electric ﬁeld would create regional conditions in cortical tissue favorable for activating
axons. Also, the number and the location of the activated axonal areas depend on both the neural tissue
architecture and geometry, in relation to the direction of the electric ﬁeld. The pattern of activated axons
depends on the direction of the electric ﬁeld and of the state of the cortical region being stimulated.
The more numerous intersecting axons within an axonal bundle, the more numerous the axonal
couplings [379]. An axon curvature would be as excitable as the initial segment [380]. Because the
axonal membrane is more excitable than the somatodendritic membrane and is endowed with
integrative properties [372,376,378], the TES-induced ﬁeld may activate intracortical axons and axonal
endings, where action potentials may be initiated. Dopamine and kainate can generate axon membrane
depolarization leading to action potential initiation [381,382]. Also, oligodendrocytes, in addition to
regulating myelination, would play a promoting role in synchronizing ﬁring through axons [383].
Axo-axonal interactions can also involve glial cells [384]. Once triggered, ectopic axonal action
potentials would run along the axons simultaneously both orthodromically up to the axon terminals
and antidromically up to the parent somatodendritic domains. The orthodromically conducted action
potentials would then activate local and distant postsynaptic neurons. A single orthodromically
conducted action potential can even itself generate, for a while (a few tens of ms), a sequence of
excitatory and inhibitory synaptic events in a subpopulation of interconnected glutamatergic and
GABAergic neurons [385]. On the other hand, the antidromically conducted action potentials
can activate directly the parent somatodendritic complex [376,378]. Moreover, TC neurons can
spontaneously generate ectopic axonal action potentials, which subsequently modulate the parent
soma’s excitability [376,386].
Cortical neurons are excited when the electric ﬁeld is directed from the dendrites toward
the axon [328]. The impedance mismatch between the dendritic arbor and the principal axon
represents a likely mechanism for TES-induced cortical excitation [328]. Moreover, low-intensity
electric ﬁelds concurrent to suprathreshold synaptic inputs can modulate the timing of action potential
initiation [387]. Therefore, TES has the potential to inﬂuence the functional input-output balance
in neurons.
Electrical couplings: Couplings between neurons in the central nervous system can occur through
electrical synapses, that is, gap junctions [388,389]. They represent another potential target for the TES
electric ﬁeld. An important feature of these synapses is that they are bidirectional. Axo-axonal electric
coupling via gap junctions is thought to contribute to the oscillating and integrative properties of neural
networks [389–394]. This is a possible mechanism through which periodic TES can entrain oscillating
neural networks. Sparse electrical couplings through axo-axonal gap junctions play a key role in the
initiation and spreading of network gamma and higher (>100 Hz) frequency oscillations [392,393,395].
The coupling action potentials occur in the axon prior to invading the parent somatodendritic
tree [389]. Such a mechanism represents a fast device for signal transmission directly between the
outputs of neurons, thereby leading to temporally precise ﬁring during fast network synchrony [389].
This supports the notion that the axon and its branches are not only reliable transmission cables for
action potentials but also functional entities with integrative properties [376,396,397]. In the presented
CT-TRN-TC system (Figure 4), it is shown that intracortical GABAergic parvalbumin-expressing
interneurons communicate with each other through electrical and chemical synapses, which are
functional modalities of tight couplings that contribute to the generation of synchronized oscillations
in cortical structures [398]. Such couplings may also be inﬂuenced by TES.
Electrical couplings between central nervous system neurons can also occur through direct electrical
(or ephaptic: touch phenomenon through ion exchanges between two adjacent excitable membranes)

126

Brain Sci. 2017, 7, 34

coupling [399,400]. Electrical couplings could also be mediated by the electric field generated jointly
by many parallel axons. Such couplings might significantly be influenced not only by endogenous
but also by exogenous electric fields independently of electrical and chemical synapses [401–403].
Therefore, ephaptic couplings may be one important target for TES. Ephaptic couplings between
axons might be involved in the synchronization and the timing of action potentials as well.
Endogenous or exogenous oscillating electric fields impose temporal windows, during which periodic
ephaptically-induced membrane polarization can become the source of enhanced excitability in the
corresponding neurons [401,404]. Thereby, ephaptic coupling leads to coordinated spiking activity
among nearby neurons [401]. Ephaptic coupling influences the synchronization and timing of firing in
neurons receiving suprathreshold synaptic inputs [360,387,405,406].
Combined digital and analog coding: It is usually taught that excitatory and inhibitory synaptic
inputs modulate the integrative properties of the somatodendritic membrane areas, which lead to local
voltage ﬂuctuations (synaptic activity) that propagates up to the axon hillock, the non-myelinated
segment of the principal axon, which will initiate a ﬁring pattern (barcode) subsequently transmitted
to the downstream synapses [407–412]. Once initiated, the action potentials simultaneously propagate
orthodromically along the principal axon up to the presynaptic terminals, where they cause Ca2+
inﬂux and transmitter release [413], and antidromically into the somatodendritic arbor, preventing
the activation of the trigger zone at a proper time and/or triggering dendritic activities [414]. In vitro
studies have demonstrated that, in the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus, somatodendritic voltage
ﬂuctuations can propagate over signiﬁcant distances along the axon, change the amplitude and
duration of the axonal action potential and, through a Ca2+ -dependent mechanism, change the
amplitude of the corresponding postsynaptic potentials [415,416]. In short, axons can transmit analog
signals in addition to action potentials (Figure 4). Such a combined digital and analog coding represents
an additional mechanism for information processing in neural networks. This dual coding must be
a functional target for TES. It can be predicted that a TES-induced ﬁeld can, for instance, modulate
(via ampliﬁcation, attenuation or interference) the amplitude of the voltage ﬂuctuations running
along the axon with subsequent impact on the action potential-evoked transmitter release at the
corresponding synapses.
Top–down control: The ﬁrst neural elements that are intensely impacted by any TES technique
are, by all likelihood, ﬁrst located in the more superﬁcial layers of the cerebral cortex. The layer I or
molecular layer, which is situated just underneath the pial surface, contains dense bundles of axons
and dendrites and a paucity of sparsely distributed cell bodies [417,418]. Some of these axons give rise
to descending axonal branches that innervate cortical neurons, thereby exerting a top-down control
on the cortical and subcortical networks. For instance, it was demonstrated that the electric current
generated by TMS can activate a network of GABAergic interneurons that innervate, in the upper
cortical layers, the apical dendrites of layer V pyramidal neurons [362]. This GABAergic inhibition
would be mediated by GABA(B) receptors, and their activation would decrease or suppress dendritic
Ca2+ currents implicated in the synaptically-mediated dendritic excitation, which is involved in the
integration of information. Even if such a scenario could also apply to the dendrites of layer VI CT
neurons, it remains a challenge to predict, from the inspection of individual mechanisms, the actual
activity pattern of the CT neurons. Assuming that TES inhibits their somatodendritic activity and
ﬁring, reduced ﬁring of layer VI CT neurons, which exert a massive excitatory pressure on both TC
and TRN neurons (Figure 2), would lead to a disfacilitation of the thalamic activity. So, the proposed
TES-induced CT disfacilitation would reduce ﬁrst the monosynaptic excitation of the glutamatergic TC
and GABAergic TRN neurons and, secondly, the disynaptic inhibition of the TC neurons (Figure 4).
Furthermore, because of the presence of dendrodendritic synapses between TRN neurons [168,171]
and because of their pacemaker properties for GFO [232], TES-induced disfacilitation would also
reduce the multisynaptic intra-TRN inhibitions [176], a possible brake for the generation of thalamic
GFO. It is thus tempting to hypothesize that such TES-induced intracortical dendritic inhibition can
reduce the power of GFO in cortical and subcortical structures.

127

Brain Sci. 2017, 7, 34

Bottom–up effect from the thalamus: So far, TES has been presented as a noninvasive therapeutic
means exerting top-down effects from the current source. Such effects can be categorized into at
least two principal types of mutual interactions: local type with top-down controls, for instance
the one discussed above, and a highly–distributed type, which involves interconnected cortical
and subcortical networks. Indeed, it was well demonstrated that TES can directly, likely through
non–synaptic mechanisms, entrain/modulate subcortical neurons [360]. The TES-induced electric
ﬁelds would act as endogenous electric ﬁelds, which are known to guide network activity, to
modulate the timing of action potentials [419], and to enhance stochastic resonance [420]. This is
valid for both tDCS (static electric ﬁeld) and tACS (alternating electric ﬁeld) with effects on brain
function [387]. The TES–induced ﬁeld effects would modulate the amplitude of subthreshold and
suprathreshold membrane potential oscillations of the target neurons. Because of a large number
of variables mentioned above, it is difﬁcult to provide a precise picture of the direct effects of TES
ﬁeld on both GABAergic TRN and glutamatergic TC neurons. Whatever the differential effects, both
types of neurons work together and mutually inﬂuence each other. TES would affect their threshold
mechanisms equivalent to an integrate–and–ﬁre model, which depends on a certain number of factors,
including the ion channel kinetics, the weight of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs and the
shape of the membrane potential distribution near threshold [421,422]. However, as mentioned above,
we should keep in mind that both TRN and TC neurons generate action potentials during sustained
membrane potential depolarization and hyperpolarization.
The GABAergic TRN neurons can be considered a privileged cell-to-network target for TES
indirectly through the CT pathway, as mentioned above, and directly. In the following, I will speculate
on possible mechanisms underlying eventual direct effects at the thalamic level, more speciﬁcally in
the GABAergic TRN cells. It is ﬁrst important to know that, at a sufﬁciently hyperpolarized membrane
potential, TRN cells are more excitable and electro-responsive than TC neurons. Indeed, high-frequency
bursts of action potentials generated by excitatory inputs require a higher degree of convergence of
excitatory inputs than TRN neurons [423]. Furthermore, TRN cells are endowed with low-threshold
T-type calcium currents of longer duration than TC neurons [424,425]. These anatomofunctional
properties suggest that TRN cells may be more electro-responsive to TES than TC neurons.
Gap junctions-mediated electrical synapses is another important characteristic of GABAergic TRN
neurons [172,426]. Such electrical synapses are implicated in diverse forms of cell-to-network signaling.
Using a novel dye-coupling technique, Connors and colleagues [427] further demonstrated that, in the
rodent, electrically coupled TRN cells form clusters with distinctive patterns and axonal projections.
Unpredictably, TES would facilitate the synchronized generation and spread of electrically- and
chemically-induced synaptic activities within TRN clusters. The presumed TES-induced TRN activity
patterns would strongly inﬂuence network oscillations, which would generate inhibitory activities
(principally lateral inhibition [179]) in the related populations of TC neurons. To sum up, alternating
TES (or tACS) is expected to inﬂuence directly the thalamus, which is a well-known oscillator [221].
Here, in the present conceptual context, the thalamus is a reference. This means that the proposed
mechanisms underlying direct subcortical effects could apply to other sub-neocortical structures,
such as the hippocampus [360], along with their respective anatomofunctional properties.
Another direct inﬂuence relies on the fact that, as above mentioned, the axonal membrane is more
excitable than the somatodendritic membrane. So, assuming that the ongoing state of the cortex allows
TES-mediated triggering of action potentials on axonal terminations of TC neurons, the corresponding
ectopically-generated axonal action potentials would backpropagate up to the parent somatodendritic
complex of these TC neurons. Such antidromically conducted axonal action potentials would inﬂuence
the somatodendritic excitability of the corresponding TC neurons [376]. If true, such an effect may,
under suitable circumstances regarding the network state, short-circuit the CT-mediated thalamic
multisynaptic effects. In theory, such an effect would be more efﬁcient when the somatodendritic ﬁeld
is hyperpolarized (see Figure 35 in [376]). In short, TES would not only generate action potentials on

128

Brain Sci. 2017, 7, 34

ectopic axonal membrane but also modulate the timing of action potential initiation in the axonal and
somatodendritic membrane [387], thereby inﬂuencing the dynamics and plasticity of neural networks.
In summary, regarding its multiple and diverse mechanisms, TES would exert local and
highly distributed inﬂuences on the ongoing thalamic activities through at least three principal
ways. They would, over time, occur individually or in combination leading to polysynaptic effects
(Figure 4): (1) Direct, intracortical synaptic and non-synaptic (especially electrical) mechanisms, thereby
modulating the excitability of the CT axon (from the hillock to the ascending ramifying axon collaterals)
and the integrative properties of the CT neurons’ somatodendritic arbor; (2) direct, intracortical
modulation of the excitability of TC axon terminals, which could initiate antidromic ﬁring along the
principal axon of TC neurons with subsequent effects on the TC neurons’ somatodendritic membrane
state-dependent excitability and a monosynaptic excitation of TRN cells; (3) direct forced TES ﬁeld
effect on thalamic neurons, especially on the GABAergic TRN cells because they are endowed with
more “explosive” electrophysiological properties than TC neurons, leading for instance to phase–biased
cellular ﬁring. Whatever the TES-induced top-down and bottom-up (from presumed direct effect
on thalamic neurons) mechanisms, the effect on the excitability and integrative properties of all
the elements (including non-neuronal) that make up the CT-TRN-TC system would depend on its
ongoing functional state. At any rate, TES-elicited modulation of the CT pathway should inﬂuence
the thalamic neurons’ spatiotemporal properties, which are related to the center-surround receptive
ﬁeld [428]. The predictions and hypotheses presented in the present essay need to be validated through
appropriate experiments.
7. Conclusions and Perspectives
In the present essay, I began with a neurophysiological perspective on early therapeutic
intervention (TES) in at-risk mental state individuals against the occurrence of FE psychosis, chronic
psychotic disorders, and schizophrenia. Because of their noninvasiveness, low-cost and safety, the use
of TES therapeutic modalities, which are almost free of side-effects, is increasing over years with
encouraging and promising clinical outcomes. Furthermore, there is accumulating evidence that
static (DC ﬁeld) or alternating (AC ﬁeld) TES exerts an effect on brain function. On the other hand,
the underlying mechanisms still remain elusive. There is accumulating evidence that exogenous electric
currents can modulate not only brain electrical activity but also behavioral and cognitive performance.
All the proposed mechanisms belong to a continuum that can be considered “meta-mechanisms” at
the brain-network level. The use of TES may be seen as a “natural” treatment as it can inﬂuence,
like endogenous electric ﬁelds, the excitability and the integrative properties of the brain nerve cells and
subcellular elements. TES can, through the extensive CT and cortico-cortical systems, nonselectively
affect, directly and through multisynaptic pathways, global brain activity. This is not surprising since
electrical modulation of a single neuron can modify not only the global brain state [429] but also
motor behavior [430], and that a single action potential can itself generate sequences of excitatory and
inhibitory synaptic events in subnetworks [385].
On the basis of our current knowledge, it is tempting to put forward that noninvasive therapeutic
interventions using TES might turn out to be very promising in the future as there is emerging
evidence that TES might supplant surgical DBS therapy against neurobiological disorders, including
Parkinson’s disease. This might also be the case for epilepsy, dystonia, obsessive compulsive disorders,
pain, multiple sclerosis, addiction, depression, Tourette syndrome, and in brain–injured patients
in vegetative and minimally conscious states. That TES (with settings adjusted on the basis of
cortical-subcortical oscillations) can be applied to treat any neurobiological disorder rests on the
notion that TES would set into action highly-distributed networks, which would help the brain, in case
of dysfunctional networks associated with disturbed oscillations, to retrieve its fundamental capability
to self-organize, self-calibrate and self-correct [431,432].
In the present essay, there is a bias toward rodent models merely because the CT-TRN-TC system
of rodents and humans share common anatomo-functional properties. The CT-TRN-TC system was

129

Brain Sci. 2017, 7, 34

put on the stage since the widespread CT pathway, the thalamus and the glutamatergic synaptic
transmission together form an etiopathophysiological backbone for schizophrenia and, therefore,
may represent a prime therapeutic target for preventive TES of dysfunctional brain networks in
at-risk mental state individuals against the occurrence of ﬁrst-episode psychosis and schizophrenia.
Importantly, the one common denominator is cortical GFO, which are ampliﬁed not only during
hallucinations but also in at-risk individuals for psychosis and during ﬁrst-episode psychosis.
Furthermore, abnormal network gamma hypersynchrony is likewise recorded in the CT systems
of healthy humans and rodents after a single systemic administration, at a psychotomimetic dose, of
the NMDAR antagonist ketamine. These translational ketamine models of prodromal to ﬁrst-episode
psychosis are thus promising means not only to work out a preventive treatment against the occurrence
of chronic schizophrenia but also to investigate the TES mechanisms.
An important question remains open as to whether TES is capable of replacing the generalized
cortical-to-subcortical ongoing gamma hypersynchrony for normal gamma synchrony. Importantly,
alpha frequency (10 Hz) tACS can reduce the power of cortical GFO [433]. This is interesting
since ongoing alpha oscillations are often associated to cortical idling whereas GFO are associated
to an attentional state [128]. Because of its activity-dependent dynamic properties, the CT
pathway is expected to play a crucial role in the modulation of the ongoing activity in the
CT-TRN-TC system. Indeed, a comprehensive in vitro study performed in rodent CT-TRN-TC slices
demonstrated that a low-frequency optogenetic stimulation (≤10 Hz) exerts a suppressive effect on
TC neurons’ activity [205]. In other words, we predict that TES of the extensive CT pathway can
re-normalize/improve its key attentional role to generate in the dysfunctional CT-TRN-TC circuits,
more speciﬁcally in at-risk mental state individuals, “normal” prediction models that guide the
ﬂow and sequences of sensorimotor and cognitive processes. Such mechanisms would operate in
combination with the TRN, strategically located at the interface between the dorsal thalamus and the
neocortex, through the modulation of the excitatory and suppressive components of the receptive ﬁelds
in the appropriate and related cortical and thalamic territories. Thereby, principally under the inﬂuence
of the TC pathway, the TRN may ﬁne-tune the responsiveness of sensory, motor and cognitive TC
neurons, depending on the ongoing functional brain state and on the relative timing of the multiple
and diverse thalamic inputs.
Now, if TES were able to suppress the psychosis-relevant CT-TRN-TC gamma hypersynchrony,
thought to be the electrophysiological correlate of a hyper-attentional state, would it stop the occurrence
of the schizophrenia-relevant clinical disorganization and the emotional, sensorimotor and cognitive
abnormalities? This is a fundamental issue that certainly needs further investigation.
Also, should TES be systematically applied, along with ethical guidelines, in a standard fashion to
all at-risk mental state patients for psychotic disorders? Probably not. This is an important issue because
its efﬁciency depends on multiple variables, more speciﬁcally on the brain state and longitudinal
outcomes. Also, in an attempt to effectively apply TES at the right time, it might be necessary to use a
closed-loop feedback system able to trigger the stimulation on the basis of the pattern of the ongoing
brain activity [434].
On the other hand, TES may be supplanted by, or combined with, other non-pharmacological
therapies, for instance, with cognitive remediation and psychotherapies. These latter therapies are
promising when it comes to helping individuals with impaired cognitive performance [146,435–437].
Mindfulness-based therapy may also be an interesting alternative or complement to TES [438]. All these
alternatives mean that a good quality of life prevails for at–risk mental state and ﬁrst-episode psychosis
patients [44] with or without a rational use of TES in the frame of a personalized medicine.

Abstract: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) has been used to target many deep brain structures for
the treatment of chronic pain. The periaqueductal grey and periventricular grey (PAG/PVG)
is an effective target but results are variable, sometimes short-lived or subject to tolerance.
The centromedian intra-laminar parafascicular complex (CMPf) modulates medial pain pathways
and CMPf DBS may address the affective aspects of pain perception. Stimulation of multiple
deep brain targets may offer a strategy to optimize management of patients with complex pain
symptomatology. However, previous attempts to stimulate multiple targets requires multiple
trajectories and considerable expense. Using a single electrode to stimulate multiple targets would
help overcome these challenges. A pre-requisite of such a technique is the ability to use different
stimulation parameters at different contacts simultaneously on the same electrode. We describe a
novel technique in 3 patients with chronic pain syndromes for whom conventional medical and/or
neuromodulation therapy had failed using a single electrode technique to stimulate PVG/PAG and
CMPf at dual frequencies.

1. Introduction
1.1. Deep Brain Targets for the Treatment of Pain
For over 60 years deep brain stimulation (DBS) has demonstrated signiﬁcant analgesic beneﬁts.
James Olds and Peter Milner found stimulation of septal regions in rodents elicited self-stimulation
overwriting normal survival behaviours [1]. In attempts to treat patients with schizophrenia,
stimulation of septal structures yielded serendipitous pain relief [2]. Sufferers of malignant oncological
diseases and rheumatoid arthritis provided a willing and ethically justiﬁable cohort and, indeed,
septal region DBS proved moderately effective in early studies. However, due to variable and
non-sustained responses, ﬁnding alternative deep brain targets became a priority. Consequently
targets range from the internal capsule (IC) [3] to thalamic structures such as the somatosensory
thalamus, centromedian intralaminar parafascicular complex (CMPf) [4], to the periventricular and

Brain Sci. 2017, 7, 9

periacqueductal grey (PVG/PAG) [5], to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) [6] and anterior cingulate cortex
(AC) [7]. However, despite this array of deep brain targets, the complexity of pain management is a
persistent challenge demanding new approaches. We provide a technical note of a novel technique
and a review of the literature. Stimulation of PVG/PAG and CMPf is the focus of this review and
technical note and will be described separately. The rationale and effects of targeting the other deep
brain nuclei are important to place the treatment of chronic pain by DBS in context.
1.2. Anterior Cingulate
The ﬁrst published case of AC DBS was reported by Spooner et al. [8] in a patient with neuropathic
pain secondary to spinal cord injury. He received bilateral and unilateral DBS to the AC and PVG
respectively. Pain relief was assessed using the Visual Analogue Scale for pain (VAS) and by tracking
pain medication usage. Bilateral cingulate stimulation resulted in improved affect and was associated
with improved subjective analgesic properties relative to PVG stimulation alone. Boccard et al., in
2014 [7] presented a case series of AC stimulation in 15 patients with chronic pain with a range of
aetiologies including failed back surgery syndrome, poststroke pain, brachial plexus injury, cervical
spinal cord injury, head injury, and pain of unknown origin. Using several pre- and post-operative pain
measures they detected statistically signiﬁcant overall improvement in reported pain. In 5 patients VAS
decreased to less than 4 on a scale of 1 (no pain)–10 (very severe pain). No major adverse events were
reported. Although, this study is limited by its heterogenous population and assessment measures
that under emphasize the affective components of pain, this study demonstrates that AC stimulation
is a useful option. As such, preclinical and clinical studies have explored the importance of the AC in
pain perception, which has been subject to comprehensive review [9].
1.3. Nucleus Accumbens
NAc, forms an extension of the ventral striatum, which is involved in reward processing. DBS of
the NAc is used in the treatment of depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder [10,11]. NAc also
projects inhibitory projections to the medial thalamus [12] and thereafter to dorsal horn neurons to
modulate pain perception [13]. The NAc together with the prefrontal cortex, insula and AC mediates
the affective component of pain [12,13]. One case of post-stoke pain has been treated using DBS
targeting the NAc and PVG simultaneously to great effect [6]. In our case of post-stroke pain described
herein, stimulation of the NAc was combined with dual targeting of the PVG/PAG, however this was
not found to be helpful.
1.4. The Somatosensory Thalamus
Somatosensory thalamus consisting of the ventroposterior lateral (VPL) and medial (VPM) nuclei
have been targeted to treat chronic pain for over 40 years [14,15] Hosobuchi et al., in 1973 treated
ﬁve patients with facial pain secondary to retrogasserian rhizotomy. Chronic stimulation of the
contralateral VPM induced a paresthesia, which improved pain tolerance in 4 out of 5 patients [14].
The explanation for targeting the somatosensory thalamus is its aberrant neuronal ﬁring observed
in chronic pain [16] presumably driven by the absence of normal sensory input [17]. Melzack and
Wall support this idea in their gate control theory [18], postulating that low threshold somatosensory
pathways inhibit pain perception. Stimulation of this pathway was expected to reduce neuropathic
pain. This has been supported in animal models where VPL stimulation inhibited spinothalamic
nociceptive neurons [16,19]. Indeed, in a series of 12 patients with neuropathic pain secondary
to brachial plexus injuries and phantom limb pain, 11 demonstrated improvement in pain scores
following stimulation of VPL [20].
1.5. PVG/PAG
The PVG/PAG (see Figure 1a) is the most promising target in DBS for chronic pain [21]. The ﬁrst
descriptions of PVG/PAG DBS in humans demonstrated relief of somatoform and nociceptive
154

Brain Sci. 2017, 7, 9

pain in both the acute and chronic settings [22,23]. This was consistent with descriptions of a
PAG- derived descending inhibitory system modulating nociceptive inputs at a spinal level [24].
Indeed, recent evidence demonstrates PAG DBS causes a focal reduction of opioid binding in areas
of electrostimulation consistent with the release of endogenous opioid peptides [25]. This is in
keeping with several studies implicating opioids in PAG/PVG mediated attenuation of nociception.
The analgesic effect of PAG DBS in both animal models and humans is reversible with the
opioid antagonist naloxone [26] and opioid receptor binding density is also remarkably high [27].
However, the picture is complicated by blinded studies of DBS PAG patients whose analgesia was not
fully reversed by naloxone and similarly failed to show cross-tolerance to systemically administered
opioids [5]. Such ﬁndings raise the possibility of non-opioidergic mechanisms of PAG analgesia [28,29]
painting a more complex picture of pain control. Indeed, although stimulation of the PAG/PVG
provides long-term relief in 79% of patients with nociceptive pain, it is less effective in central and
de-afferentation pain syndromes [28]. Taken together although PAG/PVG stimulation are an important
focus, its mechanism of action is complex and innovation is still required to design better treatments
for patients.

1.6. Centromedian Parafasciculus Complex (CMPf)
Intra-operative stimulation of the CMPf and the intra-laminar zone achieves variable
results [30,31], which may explain why it has received less attention compared to other targets.
The CMPf (Figure 1b) was ﬁrst described by Jules Bernard Luys [32], a 19th century Neurologist
who also was ﬁrst to describe the subthalamic nucleus. Dividing the medial and lateral thalamus,
the internal medullary lamina contains anterior nuclei and posterior nuclei, the latter of which contains
the CMPf [31]. The CMPf has afferents from the ventral posterolateral thalamus (VPL), spinothalamic
tract (STT) and trigeminal lemniscus, and efferents to the striatum, cortex, and AC. It is responsive to
noxious stimuli in rodents, large animals and primates [30]. However, neurones in the CMPf do not
respond in a binary fashion but differentiate stimulus intensity. Firing of the VPL to nociceptive inputs
carried within the STT actually inhibit activity in the CMPf, giving rise to a “thalamic gate theory”
155

Brain Sci. 2017, 7, 9

akin to Melzack and Wall’s ideas of pain modulation in the spinal cord [19]. Inputs to the striatum
and the anterior cingulate also suggest the CMPf may modulate affective and behavioural responses
suggesting that the CMPf is central to the concept of the medial pain pathway [33].
In human studies, the CMPf demonstrates increased background activity in neuropathic pain [34].
Similarly, the CMPf also expresses a high density of opiate receptors in the rested state [35,36].
Rinaldi et al. found that the intra-laminar thalamic nuclei, including the CMPf are also active in
de-afferentation pain [37] and moreover, stimulation of the PVG reduces CMPf ﬁring suggesting
critical connectivity of the CMPf to pain-encoding structures [38]. Hariz and Bergenheim found that
CMPf stimulation or ablation was helpful in the treatment of central pain and de-afferentation pain [39].
However in a prospective study of bilateral thalamic stimulation, CMPf stimulation only provided
short-term relief from neuropathic pain [40]. Despite this it remains a promising target due to its
anatomical and electrophysiological proﬁle.
1.7. Dual Stimulation
The interconnectivity within the central nervous system prompts the consideration of stimulating
multiple brain structures simultaneously to recruit complex neuronal processes involved in pain
sensation and perception. In a meta-analysis the most successful technique to provide long term
analgesia in 87% of cases reported was stimulation of both the PVG/PAG and Sensory thalamus/IC [21].
In the same way, stimulation of PVG and NAc have been used to treat post-stroke pain successfully [6].
We have previously published outcome data (n = 3) for dual stimulation of PAG/PVG and CMPf
in the treatment of trigeminal anaesthesia dolorosa (TAD) [41]. The mean VAS was acutely reduced
from 55 mm to 24 mm for PAG stimulation and from 67 mm to 22 mm for CMPf stimulation. PAG/PVG
and CMPf stimulation were associated with pleasant warmth and improved pain tolerance respectively.
Dual stimulation elicited both these features and was ultimately associated with reduction in analgesia
requirements. This study by our group [41] and those reviewed by Bittar et al., [21] demonstrate the
non-antagonistic effects of dual stimulation in the treatment of chronic pain. However, dual stimulation
has practical considerations. For example, in our case series of 3 patients receiving dual stimulation for
TAD, all patients required separate generators and trajectories per target to deliver dual stimulation
parameters [41]. This is in itself multiplies the risk of haemorrhagic and infective complications as well
as the ﬁnancial cost. However, whilst treating a patient with phantom limb pain (not included in this
series), stimulation of the proximal contacts of a PAG/PVG-targeted electrode yielded surprisingly
favourable results. Closer inspection of these proximal contacts demonstrated their location within
the CMPf lying along the trajectory directed toward the PAG/PVG (Personal Communication N.P.).
The ability to target both the CMPf and PAG/PVG simultaneously along a single trajectory provided
a solution to the increased cost and risk of surgical morbidity associated with dual stimulation by
“striking two birds with one stone”.
Single electrode dual targeting offers a practical solution to a risky and expensive problem and
may encourage others to further explore the potential of dual stimulation. The ultimate aim would be
to exploit different pain circuitry to provide synergistic modulation of complex pain symptomatology.
However, such synergism can only be achieved by stimulating targets at their optimal parameters.
Hence, single electrode dual targeting techniques require generators equipped to deliver different
frequencies simultaneously. Through collaboration with Boston Scientiﬁc® (Marlborough, MA, USA),
we exploited the versatility of the Boston Scientiﬁc VerciseTM generator (Boston Scientiﬁc Inc,
Marlborough, MA, USA) to perform single electrode dual target dual stimulation PVG/PAG and
CMPf DBS in 3 cases with chronic pain who either failed or were not amenable to conventional spinal
cord stimulation.
2. The Technique
The technique previously developed by this group is based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
directed electrode implantation using implantable guide tubes [42]. Pre-operative planning scans

156

Brain Sci. 2017, 7, 9

including T1 and T2 MRI and Computer Tomography Angiogram (CTA) are co-registered on in-house
adapted NeuroinspireTM software (Renishaw PLC., Wotton-under-Edge, UK). Deep brain trajectories
to the CMPf and PAG are planned with proximal electrode contacts positioned within CMPf and distal
contacts within PAG/PVG (see Figure 2a,b). Simultaneous targeting of both structures with a single
trajectory requires the use of a DBS system with contacts spanning a sufﬁcient distance and with the
facility to use different stimulation parameters at each target. We have therefore opted to use the
Boston Scientiﬁc VerciseTM system to achieve these aims.

Figure 2. Dual frequency stimulation using a single electrode technique to target the Periaqueductal
Grey/Periventricular Grey (PAG/PVG) and Centromedian Intralaminar Parafasciular complex (CMPf)
in the treatment of chronic pain. (a) Tracings of the CMPf (blue) and PAG/PVG (red) in coronal
plane undergo volumetric reconstruction using NeuroInspireTM software to create 3-dimensional
structures for robot-guided DBS electrode implantation; (b) Contacts 1–3 and 5–8 are embedded within
the PAG/PVG and CMPf respectively along the same trajectory; (c) Spherical electrical ﬁelds (red)
at contacts 4 and 8 stimulate the PAG/PVG and CMPf respectively yielding analgesia in a case of
refractory phantom limb pain.

In the operating theatre, the patient is placed under general anaesthetic and a Leksell
frame ﬁtted. The patient is then placed in the head-holder of the Neuromate stereotactic robot
(Renishaw PLC., Wotton-under-Edge, UK). Using intra-operative post-contrast three-dimensional
ﬂuoroscopy (O-Arm, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA), the patient position is registered and
stereotactic co-ordinates outputted to the robot. A linear scalp incision is made and the periosteum
retracted. The robot is driven to the ﬁrst position on the skull and a multi-featured burr hole drilled.
Using custom-made tooling a track is dissected using 1.3 mm and 1.7 mm outer diameter (OD) guide
rods which traverse both CmPf and PAG. Prior to implantation of the electrode, a radio-opaque
carbothane guide tube and stylet (Renishaw PLC, Wooton-under-Edge, UK) are inserted to target.
The guide tube is cut 20 mm shorter than the stylet in order to ensure exposure of the electrode contacts
within the deep brain targets. Insertion of guide tubes and stylets are visualized without the metal
artifact and targeting accuracy veriﬁed by performing O-arm imaging after electrode insertion.
Once targeting accuracy is conﬁrmed by co-registering the on-table imaging with the
pre-operative plan, the stylet is removed and replaced with a Boston Scientiﬁc Vercise DBS
system (model DB2201). Integration of the Boston VerciseTM DBS with NeuroinspireTM software
(Renishaw PLC, Wooton-under-Edge, UK) allows visualization of electrode contacts within the target
structures to 0.3 mm accuracy (Figure 2a,b).
Through personal collaboration between this group and Boston Scientiﬁc® , Boston Scientiﬁc
VerciseTM , model DB1110 generator was optimised for dual frequencies output (each ranging from 2 to
225 Hz) at two separate locations along the electrode (Figure 2c, Table 1). Our robot-guided technique
co-registered with pre-and perioperative imaging allows precise knowledge of contact location so
157

Brain Sci. 2017, 7, 9

contacts within the PAG/PVG and CMPf can be selectively activated. We performed this procedure in
3 patients with different aetiologies of intractable chronic pain.

2.1. Case 1
52-year old scientist with a 2 year history of progressive left-sided facial pain secondary to Lyme’s
Disease contracted during ﬁeld work was reviewed by neurosurgery following extensive contact
with pain services. Her symptoms consisted of complete hypoesthesia to the left face with associated
paraesthesia and allodynia. Supramaximal dosing of gabapentin at 5.4 g daily reduced her symptoms
but was associated with signiﬁcant cognitive disturbance and sedation. Pulsed radiofrequency therapy
of the trigeminal ganglion failed to achieve beneﬁt. The patient suffered persistent paraesthesia and
irritation interfering with her activities of daily living. The patient was admitted for single electrode
dual target surgery, which was performed under general anaesthetic with robot assistance as described
above [27]. Implantation of a guide tube via a right transfrontal approach allowed delivery of an
electrode to 96.6 mm passing through the right CMPF terminating in the right PAG. Stimulation of
the CMPf and PAG/PVG resulted in a pleasant facial paresthesia and cold sensation respectively,
dual stimulation subjectively provided preferable analgesic effects. Two days following surgery the
generator was activated using dual frequencies (Table 1). At 3 years post-surgery, the patient only
suffered minimal symptoms with full return to her activities using concomitant DBS stimulation and
gabapentin therapy weaned to 1.8 g daily (Table 1).
2.2. Case 2
A 35-year old woman with left arm phantom pain was treated with DBS. Her pain developed after
a severe episode of self-harm 10 years prior. Her tendons and nerves were cut at the proximal forearm
resulting in contractures and de-afferentation pain. Above elbow amputation was eventually required;
however, this resulted in worsening pain. Despite successful neuroma excision, a prosthesis was not
tolerated. After input from a specialist pain team and multiple pharmacological trials, the patient
underwent a trial of spinal cord (dorsal column) stimulation, which was ineffective. Her predominant
complaint was cold pain centered over her phantom elbow requiring 2.7 g Gabapentin, 400 mg
Tramadol, Baclofen 20 mg, and Amytriptyline 150 mg daily for pain control. To control her symptoms,
the patient had become reliant on a hot compress applied to her stump ﬁxed in place with a bandage.
Keeping the compress hot had become a pre-occupation leading to signiﬁcant limitation of her
outdoor activities, even making attendance of her hospital follow-up problematic. Following thorough
psychiatric assessment, the patient was admitted for single electrode dual target surgery as described.
Via a right transfrontal approach a guide-tube was implanted and an electrode passed along the
trajectory to a depth of 96.5 mm passing through the CMPf and PAG/PVG. Following activation of the
generator (Table 1) the patient’s predominant cold pain was reduced. PAG/PVG stimulation alone
158

Brain Sci. 2017, 7, 9

achieved a warm glowing sensation throughout the phantom arm, hand and ﬁngers, leaving only a
cool sensation in her ﬁnger nails. The addition of CMPf stimulation resulted in reconﬁguration of
the phantom limb leading to dissipation of her pain at the elbow (Figure 3, Table 1). The elbow pain
was however later replaced by a less severe pain in her phantom wrist (5/10 severity). It was not
possible to control the new wrist pain without a return of the elbow pain. At 3 years follow-up, the
patient was no longer reliant on her hot compress, which allowed her to leave her home and return to
independent living.

Figure 3. Pre-operative and post-operative Descriptor Differential Scale (DDS) [43] for Cases 2 and
3. Pre-operative and post-operative DDS measurements were performed for Case 2 and Case 3.
Patients were asked to mark along each line the extent to which the description applies to their
symptoms between 0 and 100. Single electrode dual target dual stimulation at 3 years follow-up
decreased the severity of pain consistently in patients 2 and 3 compared to pre-operative assessments.
Post-operative DDS measurements were not available for Case 1.

2.3. Case 3
A 49-year old man presented with an 8-year history of repeated strokes. At 41 years of age he
suffered a right middle cerebral artery infarct resulting in contralateral hemiparesis. At the time of
his infarct, the patient reported pain in the left upper limb, neck and leg with sparing of the face,
which failed to abate following his recovery. The pain was described as burning/pulling sensation
that was present all the time and it was associated with hypoesthesia. The patient was diagnosed with
central pain syndrome and received extensive input from pain physicians over the intervening eight
years with little alleviation in his symptoms. He was referred for consideration of DBS to treat his
chronic pain. He underwent single electrode right CMPf and PAG/PVG targeting combined with
targeting of his right NAc via a separate trajectory. NAc stimulation was found to be unhelpful and its
stimulation was quickly terminated. Stimulation of the CMPf and PAG/PVG separately resulted in a
warm paresthesia and reduced allodynia respectively. The patient continued dual CMPf PAG/PVG
stimulation with improvement in his pain severity at 3 years follow-up (Figure 3, Table 1).
2.4. Testing and Optimization of Dual Frequency Dual Stimulation
Testing was performed at 2.5-min intervals during each assessment. Baseline pain was established
prior to the next target being stimulated. Each patient had both pulse generators switched off prior
to testing. Pain was allowed to stabilize, which took up to 60 min. CMPf monostimulation was
159

Brain Sci. 2017, 7, 9

performed and descriptions of pain were recorded. The pulse generator was then switched off to
allow pain to re-stabilise. The PVG/PAG was then stimulated singly; the process was repeated before
ﬁnally assessing dual stimulation. Extensive description of this method is previously described by our
group [41].
3. Discussion
Dual target stimulation with a single electrode represents a natural progression from dual target
stimulation with multiple electrodes. This strategy requires the use of DBS technology with the
ﬂexibility to deliver different stimulation parameters at the proximal and distal contacts of an electrode.
Such requirements may necessitate the use of multiple generators or a specially adapted generator,
such as the Boston Scientiﬁc VersizeTM DBS system, to deliver more than one set of stimulation
parameters simultaneously.
This technique may be a potential solution to a complex condition such as intractable pain
where even recent advances in neuromodulation, such as spinal cord stimulation and intrathecal
therapy, have failed. Dual stimulation of the PVG/PAG and CMPf could help to modulate different
symptom components including affective and nociceptive features in order to optimise long-term
response and reduce tolerance. Dual targeting with one trajectory can also offer improved safety
and cost-effectiveness by minimising the number of electrode insertions, use of operating time and
resources. In this article, we describe 3 cases of robot-guided single electrode DBS to stimulate the
CMPf and PAG/PVG and the methodological steps required to provide adequate accuracy, safety and
efﬁcacy. This further establishes the combined roles of CMPf and PAG/PVG in the control of chronic
pain particularly those with de-afferentation and central pain syndromes. This also may allow us to
improve the care of patients with increasingly complex pain conditions, and perhaps even neurological
conditions beyond the current horizons of “standard” functional neurosurgery. Treatments for epilepsy,
disordered consciousness, psychiatric illness and neurodegenerative diseases could potentially all
be augmented using such a technique. Already, dual targeting has been explored outside the realms
of chronic pain by way of simultaneous stimulation of globus pallidus internus (GPi) and externus
stimulation in Parkinson’s disease [44], GPi and subthalamic nucleus in Huntington’s disease [45] and
ventral intermediate nucleus and the subthalamic area in Holme’s tremor [46]. Indeed, many promising
applications of DBS such as Tourette’s syndrome [47], epilepsy [48] and minimally conscious states [49]
boast a selection of possible deep brain targets. Single electrode dual target dual stimulation DBS,
either unilaterally or bilaterally, could be used to exploit two targets simultaneously and, with necessary
developments in electrode and generator design, possibly more. Such developments could help explore
conditions more ethically and more comprehensively allowing patients multiple therapeutic options,
whilst providing opportunities to compare the efﬁcacy of stimulating different structures without the
need for further operations. In our case series, we describe a novel concept overcoming the safety
and ﬁnancial implications of multiple targeting in DBS. This technique will hopefully encourage
others to consider its potential in chronic pain and other neurological diseases in both pre-clinical and
clinical studies. Single electrode dual target dual stimulation DBS may also facilitate further research
previously restricted by single target DBS, as dual targeting can be used to compare the stimulation
effects of different brain targets without increasing surgical morbidity or multiplying costs.
4. Limitations
DBS for chronic pain remains a challenging area for both patient and physician.
Accumulative evidence from hundreds of patients is available; however, it is observational in
nature and derived from cohort studies, case-series and reports describing heterogeneous groups
of patients, using various stimulation and neuroimaging technologies to target different deep
brain structures. This case series does little to clarify the best way to treat chronic pain, but as
a technological development it raises the possibility of treating chronic pain, and maybe other
neurological diseases, in a new way. We cannot make assertions regarding the efﬁcacy of our therapy

160

Brain Sci. 2017, 7, 9

versus other treatment options owing to the small number of patients, the absence of a control group
and the subjectivity of our recorded outcomes. Our series would be improved by being able to
demonstrate assessments of affective, as well as nociceptive, aspects of pain before and after surgery
in all patients. However, this was not possible. We can show that our technique was safe and well
tolerated. It also provided preferable analgesic relief for three patients who failed to beneﬁt from
conventional approaches.

Abstract: Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating neurological condition characterized by
a constellation of symptoms including paralysis, paraesthesia, pain, cardiovascular, bladder, bowel and
sexual dysfunction. Current treatment for SCI involves acute resuscitation, aggressive rehabilitation
and symptomatic treatment for complications. Despite the progress in scientific understanding,
regenerative therapies are lacking. In this review, we outline the current state and future potential of
invasive and non-invasive neuromodulation strategies including deep brain stimulation (DBS), spinal cord
stimulation (SCS), motor cortex stimulation (MCS), transcutaneous direct current stimulation (tDCS) and
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in the context of SCI. We consider the ability of these
therapies to address pain, sensorimotor symptoms and autonomic dysregulation associated with SCI.
In addition to the potential to make important contributions to SCI treatment, neuromodulation has
the added ability to contribute to our understanding of spinal cord neurobiology and the pathophysiology
of SCI.
Keywords: spinal cord injury; spinal cord stimulation; deep brain stimulation; neuromodulation

1. Introduction
Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating neurological disorder with a reported incidence
in various countries and regions ranging from 10 to 80 million per population per year [1–3]. It is
most commonly caused by road trafﬁc accidents, falls, violence and sports injuries. The incidence and
distribution of causes, and long-term survival rates, vary signiﬁcantly across the globe, depending upon
a wide range of complex social and economic factors [1,3,4]. It has a 2.5–5 fold higher incidence in
males, with a peak in young adults (age 20–30) [1].
SCI is characterized by a constellation of symptoms including paralysis, paraesthesia, pain,
cardiovascular, bladder, bowel and sexual dysfunction. The level of physical disability depends on
the severity of the injury and the level of injury. The severity of the injury is commonly assessed
by the International Standards for Neurological Classiﬁcation of Spinal Cord Injury (ISCNSCI)
developed by the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA). This can be classiﬁed into different
grades on the ASIA impairment scale (Table 1). Epidemiological studies suggest that more injuries
occur at the cervical levels than thoracic levels, although the exact distribution varies based on
the geographic location of the studies [1]. SCI has been shown to cause signiﬁcant autonomic
dysfunction, with neurogenic shock one of the leading causes of death [5].
Arguably at least as important as the physical and physiological disability caused by SCI are
its psychological and economic impacts. SCI predominantly affects a young adult population and
the psychological impact of rendering an independent, healthy individual paraplegic or tetraplegic

without bladder, bowel or sexual function can be devastating. In addition to the costs associated
with medical care in SCI patients, there is an immense secondary economic burden associated with
individuals incapacitated for most of their prospective career and the subsequent impact upon their
families. One study estimated the lifetime economic burden of 1.5 million 2011 Canadian dollars per
tetraplegic individual [6].

In this review, we brieﬂy outline the current management of acute and chronic SCI and focus on
the potential of neuromodulation strategies in its treatment. In particular, we review the available
clinical evidence for strategies such as deep brain stimulation (DBS), spinal cord stimulation (SCS),
motor cortex stimulation (MCS), transcutaneous direct current stimulation (tDCS) and repetitive
transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in affecting pain, sensorimotor symptoms and autonomic
dysregulation, all of which are important sequelae in SCI.
2. Current Management of Acute Spinal Cord Injury
The mainstay of current management of acute spinal cord injury involves acute resuscitation
and the prevention of secondary injury to the spinal cord. Acute resuscitation follows Advanced
Trauma Life Support principles with particular importance to the airway and breathing in high
cervical injuries that can impair diaphragmatic function, along with early spinal immobilisation.
Circulatory resuscitation is also of paramount importance due to the phenomenon of neurogenic
shock, which can cause profound bradycardia, hypotension and vasodilatation due to the loss
of sympathetic tone. Standard ﬁrst procedures include acute stabilisation, clinical assessment
(ASIA score) and computerised tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (CT and MRI).
Secondary injury to the spinal cord may be prevented by maintaining adequate perfusion to
the cord [7,8] and early decompressive surgery [9–11]. There is also a growing body of evidence
supporting intra-spinal cord pressure monitoring and expansion duraplasty for refractory intra-spinal
hypertension, drawing parallels from intracranial pressure monitoring paradigms in traumatic brain
injury [12–15].
There are currently no generally approved medical therapies to improve outcomes in acute
SCI [8], although a number of major trials are ongoing. Riluzole, a blocker of voltage-gated sodium
channels, has shown promise in improving motor function following cervical injury and is currently
the subject of a phase III randomised controlled trial [16–18]. A substance of long-term interest has
been the voltage-gated potassium channel blocker 4-aminopyridine [19], but this has given mostly
disappointing results in acute and chronic human trials examining motor improvement [20–22].
Likewise, steroid treatment (methyl-prednisolone), which some practitioners viewed favourably
in the previous two decades, now appears to offer little beneﬁt and non-negligible risk [8,23].
Induced hypothermia remains a moderately promising therapy for acute SCI [24]. This was
165

Brain Sci. 2017, 7, 18

explored over many decades to treat early traumatic brain injury, although with variable results.
Unfortunately, its critical dependence on both the timing of cooling post-injury and the level of
temperature drop appear to be largely responsible for its variable efﬁcacy in central nervous system
(CNS ) neurotrauma [25,26]. Hypothermia is a typical acute sequela of spinal cord trauma, and is
proposed to be an input to brainstem centers controlling repair, as described below.
Subsequent management involves a combination of intense rehabilitation to optimise functional
outcomes and medical therapies, designed either to prevent complications, such as venous
thromboembolic events, infections associated with indwelling catheters and pressure ulcers and
osteoporosis or to treat speciﬁc symptoms such as neuropathic pain.
3. Current Management of Chronic Spinal Cord Injury
Despite the advances of modern molecular and cellular science, there has been little clinical
progress in regenerative and restorative therapies for chronic SCI. In vitro and in vivo models have
often looked promising, but no disease modifying therapies have been successfully translated to
humans [27]. Following SCI, structurally damaged axons are unable to regenerate due to a combination
of a glial inhibitory environment and a fundamental lack of neuronal intrinsic regeneration potential.
These factors contribute to persisting functional neurological impairment. A number of promising
restorative and regenerative therapies, including the delivery of olfactory ensheathing cells to
act as a scaffold [28,29], chondroitinase therapy to limit the glial scar [30] and taxol therapy to
promote microtubule stabilization [31], have sought to target these mechanisms, with limited clinical
success [27].
The various proposals for using CNS stimulation in SCI and other neurotrauma are in part
prompted by the apparent obstacles to other approaches. Electrical stimulation of a discrete anatomical
pathway elicits a natural response that can be helpful, whereas the ultimate beneﬁts of administering
a mixture of slow-acting, powerful drugs with an array of adverse effects and issues of receptor
speciﬁcity, timing of actions, dosing regimen, tolerance and spatial targeting remain unclear.
Neurotrophic substances of potential interest additionally run the risk of uncontrolled deleterious
axonal sprouting [32]. The testing of restorative pharmacotherapies to satisfy scientiﬁc standards and
regulatory demands can also present major difﬁculties. Cell transplantation may be free of some of
these problems, but safe functional integration of exogenous cells within solid tissue is also a formidable
task, and there is the potential for tumor formation with some cell types [33,34]. The routine clinical
use of cell transplantation therefore seems to be well beyond the immediate horizon.
4. The Potential Roles for Neurostimulation in SCI
The indications for functional neurosurgery, including deep brain stimulation (DBS), cerebral cortical
stimulation and spinal cord stimulation (SCS), have expanded drastically over the last decade and
now encompass a whole host of neurological disorders including movement disorders, psychological
and psychiatric disorders, pain (including neuropathic pain and primary headache disorders),
epilepsy, disorders of consciousness and cognitive disorders [35,36].
In the context of SCI, functional procedures have the potential to impact upon a number of
different domains, including pain, functional motor/sensory recovery, bladder/bowel function and
cardiovascular autonomic dysregulation. Many of these have been highlighted as important symptoms
to address in large surveys of SCI patients [37,38].
There are three broad strategies for chronic SCI: (i) using technology to restore function
without restoring neural architecture; (ii) taking advantage of plasticity to harness residual circuitry;
and (iii) encouraging active regeneration of injured neurons. These are depicted in Figure 1.
The ﬁrst strategy involves suppressing or inducing immediate effects. Pain suppression is
an obvious example, and the most clinically developed (see next section). Less obviously, one can
try to evoke or improve some speciﬁc movements that have been lost. For example, to facilitate
locomotor movements in incompletely injured individuals, the mesencephalic locomotor region can

166

Brain Sci. 2017, 7, 18

be stimulated, thus overcoming weakness in the spinal central pattern generator [39]. This positive
approach requires in practice some integration with patient input or feedback so that it is turned on
only when safe and needed. A more complex way to provide control signals to stimulators is by
brain-machine interfaces tapping neuronal ﬁring in neocortex that represents motor commands [40].
This has been successfully implemented via wireless control connecting cortical microelectrodes to
lumbar epidural stimulators in monkeys [41]. However, a key obstacle that must be understood and
overcome is the so-called “foreign body response” that reduces the efﬁcacy of implants over time [42].

Figure 1. Diagram of possible sites for therapeutic electrical stimulation and other common
interventions in spinal cord injury (SCI). Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of a brainstem restorative
feedback loop is proposed to augment restorative effects around the injury site. This treatment
resembles cell implantation or drug treatments in that it aims for non-speciﬁc recovery of visceral and
sensory-motor deﬁcits. Most forms of stimulation are concerned with narrowly speciﬁed functions.
Thus DBS in brainstem central grey may also be used to block neuropathic pain. The nearby
mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) can be stimulated to activate descending pathways that
boost the locomotor central pattern generator (CPG) in lower thoracic and upper lumbar segments.
Cortical stimulation activating corticospinal tracts, whether non-invasively via transcutaneous direct
current stimulation (tDCS) or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), or invasively with
direct motor cortex stimulation (MCS), can be used for immediate production of movement or to induce
adaptive plastic changes in motor output. Cortical commands may also be fed to a brain-machine
interface (BMI) to control variously situated electrodes for peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) or
spinal cord stimulation (SCS). SCS distal to the injury has been used for bladder control; proximal SCS
can be used block pain; and stimulation at any spinal location can be used to generate movements,
depending on the degree of completeness of functional loss. The simplicity and comprehensiveness of
restorative DBS in the brainstem are points in its favour.

The second strategy focuses on stimulation of pathways assumed to possess considerable
neuroplasticity in their normal functioning, pre-eminently the cortico-spinal tract [43]. This propensity
for axonal growth and sprouting can perhaps be exploited by the application of stimulation, but it is
unclear how exactly to use this to shape a valid, adaptive repair.
A final strategy that has met with some preclinical success assumes that certain brain regions are
specifically adapted as centres for repairing recent mild neurotrauma [44–47]. Thus the serotonergic raphe
nuclei of the brainstem release a cocktail of trophic substances from their ubiquitous axon terminals in
response to injury-correlated sensory or chemical stimuli (e.g., nociception, unconsciousness, hypothermia,
circulating cytokines). Stimulation of this feedback loop, or the regions that feed into it, such as the
midbrain periaqueductal grey (PAG), have been shown to enhance early histological and sensory-motor
recovery in rats with incomplete thoracic SCI [35–37]. A potential advantage of these brain centres is that
they are non-eloquent, that is, the applied stimulus intensities evoked no observable motor responses or
arousal changes, facilitating continuous long-term stimulation.

5. Neurostimulation for Pain Following SCI
Pain is deﬁned by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) as “an unpleasant
sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in
terms of such damage” [48]. In the context of SCI, pain is common, affecting over 70% of SCI patients,
and can be categorised as neuropathic or nociceptive (musculoskeletal) in origin, affecting 34% and 64%
of long-term survivors respectively [49–55]. Pain following SCI is thought to occur due a combination
of abnormal inputs from the injured spinal cord and aberrant reorganisation of cortical circuitry [56,57]
and has been shown to be more common at one year following injury than immediately after [55].
The multifactorial aetiology of SCI-related pain makes it notoriously difﬁcult to treat, especially with
traditional pharmacotherapy [58,59] and the IASP’s Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group is unable
to currently recommend any interventional strategies for the management of SCI-related pain [60].
The use of neurostimulation to treat pain was reported as early as 1960 [61], predating the
Melzack & Wall gate theory [62]. Current indications of neurostimulation for pain include pain
from failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS), neuropathic pain secondary to peripheral nerve injury
(e.g., amputation, brachial plexus injury), facial pain and headache disorders [63,64]. Interventions
can target any part of an impaired nociceptive pathway, including at the level of the spinal cord, deep
brain nuclei or motor cortex [65,66].
Evidence for the efﬁcacy of DBS in the context of SCI-related pain is limited to a few patients
that form part of small series which have had varying results [63,64,67–73]. The main sites targeted
have been ventralis posterior lateralis (VPL) nucleus of the thalamus and the midbrain central gray,
comprising the periaqueductal grey (PAG) and periventricular grey (PVG). A systematic review
by Previnaire in 2009 recorded 19 cases of the successful implantation of DBS electrodes in SCI
patients following trial stimulation in 36 patients to the VPL ± central gray. Only three (16%) of
these cases reported “long-term success” [69]. DBS of VPL may also have a role in the management
of phantom sensations and pain following SCI [74]. More recently, DBS electrodes in the central
gray in two SCI patients were optimised to provide best analgesia; this study found that very low
frequency stimulation (effectively <0.67 Hz) was most effective in these two patients; added beneﬁts
included a reduction in side effects and a long battery life and the authors emphasized the importance
of allowing time (hours to days) before assessing the efﬁcacy of new stimulation parameters [75].
Improving knowledge of the somatotopic organisation of the PAG may aid optimal electrode targeting,
and given the bilateral pain often experienced by SCI patients, it is likely that most SCI patients
will need bilateral electrodes [76,77]. Based on evidence of the success on cingulotomy for cancer
related pain, Spooner et al. reported a single case of effective analgesia in SCI following DBS to
the rostral anterior cingulate cortex, although this patient was only followed up for four months [78].
A subsequent case series of patients treated with anterior cingulate cortex DBS for chronic pain
of various aetiologies (including 1 with SCI) illustrates its potential for long-term control [79].
Over the years, the lack of randomised controlled clinical trial evidence has led to a decrease in
the number of studies reporting on DBS for pain [57] and this has been confounded by the US
Food and Drug Administration giving DBS for pain “off label” status [80], so that the International
Neuromodulation Society still views intracranial modulation for pain as “investigational” [81].
Another option for SCI-related pain is epidural motor cortex stimulation (MCS), although the limited
reports in the literature suggest that SCI-related pain responds poorly to MCS compared with other pain
syndromes [68,82]. However, the systematic review by Previnaire concluded that MCS may be more
effective than DBS in the context of SCI, providing “long-term success” in four out of seven patients [69].
SCS has been used to treat a variety of pain syndromes for over 40 years and the ﬁrst reports of its
use for spinal cord injury date back to 1972 [83]. It is based upon the Melzack and Wall gate theory
that stimulation of the large dorsal column ﬁbres will inhibit some of the activity produced by smaller
myelinated and unmyelinated ﬁbres in the dorsal horn [62]. Nashold’s series of 30 patients includes
ﬁve with traumatic SCI (three from spinal fractures, one with a gunshot wound and one with a cord
contusion), none of whom had an “excellent” response to the treatment [83]. Since then, reports of
168

Brain Sci. 2017, 7, 18

the utility of SCS for SCI-related pain have been limited and suggest poorer responses in SCI patients
compared to other indications such as failed back surgery and peripheral neuropathy pain [84–86].
This may be explained by injury to the neural circuits underlying its efﬁcacy but we are still far from
understanding the mechanisms underlying the efﬁcacy and failure of SCS, especially in the context of
SCI. Newer modalities of SCS such as burst and high frequency stimulation are yet to be evaluated in
their efﬁcacy for chronic pain after SCI.
Non-invasive neuromodulatory strategies include repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
(rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), both of which are purported to work on
the basis of altering maladaptive plasticity within pain circuits, affecting nuclei in the thalamus and
subthalamic regions [59,87,88]. A recent systematic review identiﬁed six studies assessing 127 patients
with neuropathic pain treated with rTMS following SCI. It concluded that although there was some
reduction in pain indices following rTMS, this did not reach statistical signiﬁcance [89]. There are
many unresolved controversies within the ﬁeld of rTMS including the location (motor cortex versus
premotor cortex/dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), type and orientation of coil, schedule of repetitive
stimulation and persistence of therapeutic response [90–93]. However, given the non-invasive nature
of rTMS, it could prove a useful tool both in terms of mechanistic understanding and therapeutic
beneﬁt for pain following SCI. It may have a role in predicting responsiveness to MCS and the ability
to inﬂuence phantom sensations after SCI, which could provide signiﬁcant functional beneﬁts for these
patients [94,95]. tDCS is less well characterised, and differs from rTMS in that it does not result in
neuronal ﬁring but changes the resting membrane potential, thereby altering neuronal excitability.
It has long-term effects that are thought to be caused by altered neurotransmitter systems [96].
The largest clinical study to date utilised the anode over the primary motor cortex and showed
a reduction in pain VAS scores in 16 patients following SCI. The tDCS was found to alter metabolism
in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and insula, suggesting
an effect of tDCS on the emotional and cognitive components of pain [97]. The evidence in support
of tDCS has led to it being included as part of third-line therapies for neuropathic pain for SCI in
the CanPain guidelines; it is the only neuromodulatory strategy to be included in the guidelines [98].
The future of neurostimulation for pain in SCI lies in improving the level of evidence for
each intervention and identifying subsets of patients and types of pain that beneﬁt from speciﬁc
interventions. Presently, DBS for various types of pain can yield a range of effects in different
patients from dramatic and highly pleasing success to disheartening failure, and the factors leading to
these variable outcomes are entirely unclear, although there are some weak statistical predictors [77].
This task will no doubt be aided by homogenisation of the measurement of pre-intervention and
post-intervention data sets, such as the International Spinal Cord Injury Pain Basic and Extended Data
Sets [99,100]. In addition to the rigorous assessment of outcomes, surgical complications must also
be taken into consideration; studies have highlighted the burden of complications associated with
implanted stimulators, which can impact upon quality of life and overall outcomes [69].
6. Neurostimulation for Sensorimotor Recovery Following SCI
There is little in the way of clinical evidence for the efﬁcacy of neuromodulation for locomotor
and sensory recovery following spinal cord injury. Perhaps the best evidence for efﬁcacy of DBS in
animal models comes from two landmark studies, showing the efﬁcacy of DBS in improving gait in
cord injured rats. The two studies used different targets, the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR)
and the nucleus raphe magnus and the PAG [39,47], and deliver improvement in different time frames
(immediate or long-term). The correlates of this circuitry in humans need to be better understood,
especially since the efﬁcacy of stimulation for motor responses depends on the number of residual
ﬁbres within the injured cord [101].
Similar rodent and mammalian evidence also exists for SCS, which has been improved by
the use of closed-loop feedback systems to reﬁne stimulation parameters and improve gait [102–104].
The putative role for SCS can also be extrapolated from studies observing motor beneﬁt in patients

169

Brain Sci. 2017, 7, 18

and animals with Parkinson’s disease [105,106] and multiple sclerosis [107,108] undergoing SCS.
There is preliminary human evidence to suggest that epidural SCS may be efﬁcacious in producing
electrophysiological improvements in patients with SCI [109–111]. Further work is necessary to
translate these electrophysiological improvements into functional beneﬁts. Developing a better
understanding of the pattern generator for human gait may also indicate a use for lumbosacral
epidural stimulation, obviating the need for supraspinal inputs [112]. This concept of using
stimulation to replace lost supraspinal input has recently been demonstrated in a primate model,
which relies on real-time input of cortical signals to optimise lumbar epidural stimulation [41,113].
However, this model is limited by the lack of a sensory feedback system, which would further optimise
motor functional recovery.
Animal evidence also exists for the utility of combined MCS and spinal tDCS in promoting
motor recovery after pyramidotomy, suggesting that stimulation proximal and distal to the injury
could facilitate the improvement in function following SCI [114]. TMS may also have a role in motor
recovery, as it has been shown to elicit EMG responses below the level of injury in individuals with
motor-complete SCI; it may therefore have a role in identifying individuals who may beneﬁt from
neuromodulatory therapies or have a therapeutic role in its own right [115,116].
7. Neurostimulation for Autonomic Recovery Following SCI
Autonomic functions, including bladder, bowel and sexual function, have consistently been
highlighted as priorities for recovery in patients with SCI [37,38]. In the acute phase, bladder dysfunction
often manifests as a “flaccid paralysis” resulting in urinary retention requiring catheterisation.
In the chronic phase, this progresses into detrusor hyperreflexia and detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia
resulting in incontinence and incomplete voiding; the mainstay of current treatment is intravesical
botulinum toxin injection which requires repeated treatments every few months and does not address
the dyssynergia [117,118]. Sexual dysfunction can manifest in a number of different ways in males
and females, depending upon the level and completeness of the injury [117]. In addition to
the physical impact, sexual dysfunction in particular may impact psychological wellbeing and overall
quality of life [119,120]. Gastrointestinal disturbances in SCI are common (>60%) and wide-ranging,
including delayed gastric emptying, abnormal colonic myoenteric activity and sphincter/defecation
dysfunction [117,121,122]. The lower GI disturbances are consistent with a “spastic” paresis of
the bowel. The increased colonic muscle tone, abnormal rectal compliance and tight external sphincters
require laxatives and digital reﬂex stimulation to promote bowel emptying [117,123].
Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction is a major problem in SCI, and contributes to the excess
cardiovascular mortality in SCI [124]. In the acute phase, the loss of sympathetic outﬂow can lead to
devastating hypotension, hypothermia and dysrhythmias [125]. In the chronic phase, especially after
cervical or high thoracic injuries, disturbances such as orthostatic hypotension and autonomic
dysreﬂexia (sudden drastic episodes of elevated blood pressure and bradycardia) have been shown to
be common in SCI patients, which may contribute to the increased cardiovascular disease risk and also
affect other aspects of recovery such as rehabilitation and cognitive function [5,125–128]. SCI can also
lead to thermoregulatory dysfunction.
Although there is little in the way of evidence for autonomic manipulation in the context of
SCI, evidence from other conditions indicate that neuromodulation strategies may have a role [129].
There is evidence that DBS can affect urinary symptoms and control in Parkinson’s disease, dystonia,
essential tremor and chronic pain [130–133]. These studies show a predominant effect on lower urinary
tract symptoms and mechanistic studies have shown that this might be due to enhanced processing
of bladder information following subthalamic nucleus DBS. In the context of SCI, this could prove
beneﬁcial in patients with incomplete SCI, where enhancement of residual sensory inputs could
improve continence. In one study where patients had PAG stimulators for chronic pain, the maximum
cystometric capacity increased during saline infusion into the bladder when the stimulators were
switched on, indicating a switch to the “ﬁlling” state over the “voiding” state [134]. However, a deeper

170

Brain Sci. 2017, 7, 18

understanding of the subcortical networks involved in urinary continence in health and how they
are disturbed in SCI are required. A single patient has also been reported in the literature to have
improved bowel symptoms following subthalamic nucleus DBS for Parkinson’s, which may provide
beneﬁt via a similar mechanism [135].
DBS has also been shown to affect blood pressure with dorsal central gray stimulation resulting
in an increase in blood pressure and ventral central gray stimulation resulting in a decrease in blood
pressure [136–141]. There are therefore potential avenues to treat both the orthostatic hyptension
and autonomic dysreﬂexia seen in SCI patients. Ventral versus dorsal DBS in the central gay has also
been shown to alter different frequency components of heart rate variability, suggesting differential
contributions of parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems to its mechanisms of action [142].
A number of other neuromodulatory strategies have also been reported for autonomic recovery,
speciﬁcally for bladder, bowel and sexual function [118]. Although the sacral anterior root stimulator
(Brindley device) has been shown to be successful at overcoming detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia and
achieving and sustaining continence in 88% of 500 patients at a mean of four years follow-up [143],
the negative impacts of deafferentation of the posterior nerve roots on bladder, bowel and sexual
function has seen its use decline [118]. More recent evidence of using the same device for anterior and
posterior root stimulation has shown promise [144,145]. Sievert and colleagues present compelling
data that early (median 2.9 months following injury) insertion of sacral nerve modulators into the S3
nerve roots can improve urinary continence, bowel function and even help achieve erection in patients
with complete SCI [144].
8. The Future of Neurostimulation in SCI
The plethora of applications for neuromodulation in SCI provides promise in a ﬁeld currently
devoid of disease-modifying therapies. The physiological, psychological and economic beneﬁts
associated with addressing issues such as pain, mobility and autonomic symptoms in SCI patients
is large. Given the current dearth of treatment options, neuromodulation is an attractive emerging
option. However, there are a number of outstanding questions that ﬁrst need to be answered.
Apart from the need to identify evidence-based indications for deep brain, motor cortex and spinal
cord stimulation and the non-invasive strategies in the context of SCI, we also need a more nuanced
understanding of the patient, injury and treatment factors that inﬂuence success. Speciﬁcally, the timing
of interventions seems a crucial variable. The interventions for pain have thus far been performed many
months to years after the injury once aberrant circuitry has become established and it remains to be
explored whether more acute interventions could be more beneﬁcial at preventing the development of
maladapted circuits or promote regeneration [146]. Another key variable are the stimulation parameters.
As recent studies have shown, parameters that are vastly different to what is commonly used may be
more beneﬁcial [75] and optimisation of parameters may be aided by closed-loop feedback systems,
as has been tentatively shown in Parkinson’s disease [147,148].
The potential, in particular, of PAG DBS for addressing multiple symptoms is intriguing.
The animal and human evidence presented earlier in this review have illustrated the potential to
address pain, autonomic features and facilitate motor recovery in SCI. The fact that PAG is already
a target in human DBS for pain makes it an ideal candidate for further investigation to target
the disabling triad of pain, autonomic dysreﬂexia (both cardiovascular and sphincteric) and paralysis.
Mechanistic insight studies, both in humans and animals, will also aid progress in the ﬁeld.
In particular, human electrophysiological and imaging studies in spinal cord injury both before and
after neurostimulator implantation will allow us to develop a better understanding the biological
processes underlying symptomatic improvement. For example, despite the use of DBS in the central
gray for pain, the mechanism of action remains unclear [149]. Theories implicating endorphins and
opioid pathways have since been disproven [150–152]. More recent evidence has shown that DBS and
SCS may modulate gene expression [153,154]. An understanding of these modiﬁcations may provide

171

Brain Sci. 2017, 7, 18

insight into the failure of CNS regeneration following injury. However, as with other SCI studies,
translation of mechanistic understanding in animals to humans must be approached with caution [27].
Technological advances will also be of direct relevance to this ﬁeld. Smaller nanodevices for
stimulation may improve the speciﬁcity and reduce the side-effect proﬁle. Such devices have also
been reported to promote axonal regeneration in the cord [155] and may allow access to previously
inaccessible nuclei, such as the nucleus raphe magnus that has been shown to improve gait in rats [47].
Crucial to providing conclusive evidence of efﬁcacy is well designed clinical trials with relevant
outcome measures that are able to be consistently replicated. Much is to be learnt from the failure
of medical therapies such as steroids [156]. Trials in SCI will never be able to recruit large numbers,
which places added importance on trial design. An abundance of prognostic factors (ASIA score on
admission, age, level of injury, rehabilitation) increases heterogeneity in SCI trials. Adaptive trial
designs or n-of-1 trials [157] may be important in the context of neuromodulation, as will be improving
our understanding of factors inﬂuencing outcome in SCI patients. Using established frameworks
such as the IDEAL recommendations and using homogenised core outcome sets will be important to
systematic evaluation of these new technologies [158,159].
Despite the potential of neuromodulation strategies, the limitations must also be taken into
consideration. All implants and surgical procedures are associated complications such as the foreign
body response that reduces efﬁcacy over time [42]. Speciﬁcally, the risks of functional compromise
associated with damage to residual neural structures in SCI patients may be higher than in
other disorders.
9. Conclusions
Despite the current paucity of clinical evidence for efﬁcacy, functional neurosurgery has
the potential to make contributions to the treatment of SCI. It can immediately relieve some of
the many visceral and sensory-motor deﬁcits and has the potential to effectuate some useful degree of
reversal of the underlying neurodegeneration, albeit partially, by exploiting the capacity of electrical
activity to increase sprouting or induce other plastic changes in neural pathways, such as maturation
and integration of endogenous neural progenitor cells.

Abstract: Over the course of the development of deep brain stimulation (DBS) into a well-established
therapy for Parkinson’s disease, essential tremor, and dystonia, its utility as a potential treatment for
autonomic dysfunction has emerged. Dysfunction of autonomic processes is common in neurological
diseases. Depending on the speciﬁc target in the brain, DBS has been shown to raise or lower blood
pressure, normalize the baroreﬂex, to alter the caliber of bronchioles, and eliminate hyperhidrosis, all
through modulation of the sympathetic nervous system. It has also been shown to improve cortical
control of the bladder, directly induce or inhibit the micturition reﬂex, and to improve deglutition
and gastric emptying. In this review, we will attempt to summarize the relevant available studies
describing these effects of DBS on autonomic function, which vary greatly in character and magnitude

1. Introduction
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has evolved into a well-established therapy for Parkinson’s
disease [1], essential tremor [2], and dystonia [2], as well as a therapy for multiple sclerosis [3],
cluster headache [4], Tourette syndrome [5], and obsessive-compulsive disorder [6]. DBS is even
being investigated as a surgical intervention for obesity, major depression, and a therapy for restoring
memory to patients with Alzheimer disease [7–11]. In addition to the primary symptoms treated
by DBS, many groups have investigated its effect on autonomic functions at various target sites in
the brain [12,13]. Dysfunction of autonomic processes is common in neurological diseases [14–18].
In Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis, for example, patients are afﬂicted with varying
manifestations of dysautonomia including orthostatic and cardiovascular dysregulation, lower urinary
tract dysfunction, sudomotor dysfunction, and gastrointestinal disturbances [15,17,19–21]. In this
review, we will attempt to summarize the research available describing the effects of DBS on
autonomic function.
2. Methodology
A PubMed search of the available literature describing the autonomic effects of DBS was
conducted through EndNote using the keywords listed above; along with any applicable iterations;
in order to capture as many relevant references as possible. A total of 99 references were found with
this method. Those references were then categorized by the affected autonomic function and then
further by DBS target. 75 of 99 references were used in the ﬁnal reference list.

3. Sympathetic Autonomic Modulation
3.1. DBS and Cardiorespiratory Control
DBS has shown signiﬁcant effects on hypertension and hypotension. Depending on the target
in the brain, DBS can cause a decrease or increase in blood pressure, and a decrease in orthostatic
hypotension [22–24]. What makes this variable outcome possible is precise placement of the electrodes
into their targets. The region of the brain that has shown the most promise as a target for DBS blood
pressure regulation is the periventricular/periaqueductal gray matter (PVG/PAG) of the midbrain,
as described by Green et al. [25] in 2005. In a study of 15 patients undergoing PVG/PAG DBS for
uncontrolled neuropathic pain, they observed variable changes in BP depending on whether PVG/PAG
stimulation was dorsal or ventral. In six patients with ventral PVG/PAG stimulation, a mean reduction
of systolic BP of 14.2 ± 3.6 mmHg (13.9%), a mean reduction of diastolic BP of 4.9 ± 2.9 mmHg (6%),
and a mean reduction of pulse pressure of 9.3 ± 3.16 mmHg were observed [25]. In seven patients
with dorsal PVG/PAG stimulation, a mean increase in systolic BP of 16.73 ± 5.9 mmHg (16.4%),
a mean increase in diastolic BP of 4.9 ± 2.8 mmHg (6%), and a mean increase in pulse pressure of
11.83 ± 5.4 mmHg were observed [25]. There were patients in whom the electrodes did not produce any
BP alteration, but it was determined that electrode location was not in the PVG/PAG. Green et al. [25]
determined these effects to be due to modulation of sympathetic activity, due to the presence of changes
in both total peripheral resistance (TPR) and myocardial contractility [25]. Later publications, reviews,
and case reports by Green et al. and other groups all report similar ﬁndings in humans and in animal
models [12,13,22,23,26–32].
Posterior hypothalamic area (PHA) DBS, PVG/PAG DBS and subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS
have all been shown to affect orthostatic hypotension (OH) and baroreﬂex sensitivity (BRS), most likely
through changes in sympathetic activity. During head-up tilt testing (HUTT), PHA DBS can increase
diastolic BP and TPR without changing the effect of the baroreﬂex on other cardiovascular parameters
or resting supine BP and heart rate (HR) [33]. In 2006, Green et al. [24] showed that through an increase
in BRS, PVG/PAG DBS can prevent the drop in BP on standing in patients diagnosed with OH and mild
orthostatic intolerance, but does not cause resting hypertension in those patients or hypertension in the
control group with no postural BP problems. A later 2014 publication by Sverisdóttir et al. [34] reported
differential changes in patients with dorsolateral versus ventrolateral PAG DBS; that same publication
also showed an increase in orthostatic tolerance in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients with STN DBS.
Neither BRS nor BP were inﬂuenced with stimulation of the motor thalamus, globus pallidus interna
(GPi), pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), sensory thalamus, or anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) [34]. This
seems to conﬁrm prior research by Stemper et al. [35] that showed that with stimulation during HUTT,
PD patients with STN DBS had stable BP and BRS, yet without simulation during HUTT, the same
patients experienced signiﬁcant orthostatic hypotension. Therefore, the available data indicate some
anatomic speciﬁcity to the effects of DBS on BP and BRS.
In spite of evidence supporting the sympathetically-mediated improvement of OH caused by
STN DBS, its direct effects on the cardiovascular system remain unclear. A recent report of STN DBS in
PD patients by Furgala et al. [36] found that STN DBS results in activation of the sympathetic nervous
system resulting in changes to BP and heart rate variability. However, Trachani et al. [37] reported the
opposite in 2012. Several other publications also offer conﬂicting opinions on the cardiovascular effects
of STN DBS [38–40]. Sumi et al. [41] imply that the cardiovascular improvements seen with STN DBS
are due not to the stimulation itself, but rather to an increased ability to exercise, thus improving overall
cardiovascular health and lower extremity muscle strength. One explanation for the conﬂicting reports
may be that the autonomic effects are not a direct result of the stimulation at all, but are rather the result
of reduced need for pharmacotherapy to combat motor symptoms of PD [42]. Hyam et al. [12] suggest
that because STN DBS generally requires higher frequencies and higher total energy delivery than
DBS of other targets, a spread of stimulation to nearby components of the central autonomic network
could be the cause rather than stimulation of the STN itself. This conclusion seems to be supported

182

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 33

by the earlier ﬁndings of Lipp et al. [43] in 2005. In a study of ﬁve patients undergoing bilateral STN
DBS for Parkinson’s disease, four patients with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-conﬁrmed correct
placement of their electrodes within the STN experienced no autonomic symptoms. However, in the
ﬁfth patient whose electrodes were shown by MRI to extend into the posteromedial and lateral
hypothalamic areas, signiﬁcant autonomic changes were observed including changes to blood pressure
regulation, sweating, and breathing pattern [44]. This report emphasizes the importance of precise
placement of the electrodes and the tuning of stimulation frequency and total energy delivery when
autonomic effects are desired or not desired, regardless of other clinical goals.
For DBS modulation of autonomic respiratory control, the evidence is relatively new. In 2012,
Hyam et al. [45] studied the effects on two pulmonary function tests—peak expiratory ﬂow rate (PEFR)
and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1 )—of PAG DBS in ten neuropathic pain (NP) patients,
sensory thalamus DBS in seven NP patients, STN DBS in 10 movement disorder patients, and GPi DBS
in 10 movement disorder patients. Using sensory thalamus DBS to control for the effect of pain relief,
and GPi DBS to control for improvement in general motor function (both with no change in PEFR),
they showed that PAG DBS and STN DBS both increase PEFR [45]. There was no change in FEV1 with
any of the stimulated targets, indicating that the increase in PEFR was likely due to bronchodilation of
the large airways [45]. Further research into these effects could lead to DBS-mediated treatment of both
asthma and obstructive sleep apnea through dilation of bronchioles and maintenance of upper airway
patency, respectively [9]. DBS has also been implicated in increasing the respiratory rate in human and
animal studies through stimulation of the anterior limb of the internal capsule and the caudal dorsal
PAG [9,46,47]. A report by Vigneri et al. [48] claimed to show that DBS of the STN or PHA does not
affect respiratory rate, HR or BP, but they were not able to precisely localize the electrode placement,
a signiﬁcant confounding factor as shown by numerous reports described above.
3.2. DBS and Sudomotor Control
Sudomotor dysfunction, most often hyperhidrosis, is extremely common in PD patients and has
been shown to be alleviated by STN DBS [43,49–51]. In 2007, Witjas et al. [43] conducted a study
of 30 male and 10 female patients with PD lasting an average of 12.4 ± 4.5 years, in which their
nonmotor symptoms (NMS) were analyzed before and after bilateral STN DBS. One year after surgery,
34 of 35 patients were completely relieved of the drenching sweats they had experienced prior to
STN DBS [43]. This effect was again seen in a later case report by Sanghera et al. [50], in which a
STN DBS patient would experience whole body drenching sweats that would be alleviated with
stimulation, and would return when stimulation was turned off. A study of nineteen STN DBS patients
by Trachani et al. [49] observed a post-implantation reduction in hyperhidrosis in four patients, as
well as an improvement of hypohidrosis in two patients. In a 2011 study of PD patients with STN
DBS, Halim et al. [52] observed complete resolution of sudomotor dysfunction (and other autonomic
dysfunction to be discussed later) in the three patients with early onset PD (EOPD), whereas the other
eight patients with late onset PD (LOPD) did not experience any improvement in their dysautonomia.
One of the three EOPD patients experienced bilateral resolution of his excessive sweating even though
he only had unilateral left STN DBS [51]. Although STN DBS appears to dramatically help sudomotor
dysfunction, DBS of other targets can also make it worse. A DBS electrode mistakenly placed in the
thalamus or posterolateral hypothalamus can actually cause hyperhidrosis in patients who did not
suffer from it prior to surgery [44,53].
4. Parasympathetic Autonomic Control
4.1. DBS and Micturition
Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are extremely common in neurological diseases like
PD [54–56] and multiple sclerosis (MS) [3], and are a signiﬁcant source of morbidity [52]. In parallel
with the other dysautonomias above, DBS can either induce or inhibit micturition, dependent upon

183

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 33

the brain target. Basal ganglia and brainstem targets (STN and PAG) appear to inhibit micturition and
improve urinary incontinence, while thalamic targets (ventral intermediate and ventral posterolateral
nuclei—VIM and VPL, respectively) induce micturition [3]. The vast majority of studies on DBS and
micturition are on STN DBS. In 2003, Finazzi-Argò et al. [57] studied urodynamics in 5 patients with
PD and LUTS following STN DBS and found that all patients experienced increased volumes for
initial desire to void (VID ) and bladder capacity (VBC ), as well as decreased hyperreﬂexive detrusor
contraction. In their study of sixteen STN DBS patients with PD but no preexisting urinary problems,
Seif et al. [58] in 2004 found similar changes to urodynamic parameters. Herzog et al. [59,60] in
2006 and 2008 reported similar results while showing through PET studies that STN DBS may be
achieving these effects by improving cortical control over the micturition pathway. Pietraszko et al. [61]
demonstrated that in addition to the quantitative change in volumes, these patients can experience
signiﬁcant qualitative improvements to urgency, frequency, nocturia, and hesitancy as well. In the
case series by Halim et al. [51] discussed previously, the same EOPD patients who experienced
improvements in hyperhidrosis also reported subjective improvements in bladder function. As with
hyperhidrosis, the LOPD patients did not experience urinary improvement either. Fritsche et al. [62]
reported two cases of acute urinary retention as a complication of STN DBS in patients who did not
have LUTS prior to surgery. Winge et al. [63] in 2012 reported that STN DBS is at least comparable to
medication in relieving LUTS, and superior in relieving nocturia.
Other targets for modulating micturition and urodynamic parameters include the GPi, the PAG,
the VPL, and the VIM [64–66]. While GPi DBS can also ameliorate detrusor overactivity in patients
with dystonia, it has been shown to worsen maximum ﬂow rate and post-void residual volume [64].
In cystometric experiments on NP patients in which bladders are ﬁlled with isotonic saline via catheter
infusion, Green et al. showed that PAG DBS dramatically increases the maximum cystometric capacity
(MCC), the volume at which the patients would ask for the saline infusion to be stopped, but does
not affect the volumes at which voiding is desired: VID , strong desire (VSD ), very strong desire (VVSD ).
By controlling for bladder sensation and pain, which were unchanged between stimulation on and
off, they showed that the mechanism is most likely due to interruption of micturition directly [65].
In the same study, there were two VPL DBS patients who experienced smaller MCC volumes with
stimulation on [65]. This is in agreement with a prior 2008 study by Kessler et al. [66] in which it was
shown that VIM DBS results in reduced volumes for VID , VSD , and MCC. These results suggest an
induction of the micturition pathway by thalamic DBS.
4.2. DBS and Gastrointestinal Dysfunction
There has also been some evidence for DBS-mediated improvement of gastrointestinal dysmotility,
which is a common symptom in PD [15,67]. In a study of PD patients with STN DBS by Ciucci et al. [68]
in 2008, it was shown that STN DBS can improve the pharyngeal stage of deglutition, with faster
pharyngeal transit times and degrees of bolus clearance, but does not improve the oral stage of
deglutition. This resulted in less aspiration during swallowing with stimulation on versus off,
perhaps due to greater coordination of the swallowing process [68]. Silbergleit et al. [69] suggested
that STN DBS improves the patients’ perception of improved swallowing, in addition to improved
motor control during the swallowing of solid foods. In a randomized cross-over study of sixteen
PD patients with bilateral STN DBS either on or off at random, Derrey et al. [70] determined that
STN DBS can improve bolus transport in the esophagus by causing ampliﬁed peristalsis of the distal
esophagus and improved relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter. They suggested that this is
mediated by a cholinergic effect. Using 13 C-acetate breath testing in a study of 16 bilateral STN DBS PD
patients, Arai et al. [71] demonstrated improved gastric emptying with STN stimulation on versus off.
In a recent study of twenty PD patients, Krygowska-Wajs et al. [72] demonstrated that STN DBS can
improve gastrointestinal motility. They observed frequency reductions from 50% to 25% for dysphagia,
35% to 15% for sialorrhea, 95% to 75% for constipation, and 85% to 50% for difﬁculties with defecation.
The patients in the study by Pietraszko et al. [61] also reported signiﬁcant improvements in the same

184

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 33

parameters as well as abdominal pain and rectal burning during or after defecation. One of the EOPD
patients from the study by Halim et al. [51] also reported marked improvement in her bowel function,
consistent with the ﬁndings above.
5. Conclusions
In addition to its current status as the primary surgical treatment for movement disorders,
DBS has emerging potential for use as a surgical therapy for various dysautonomias. At the very
least, the autonomic effects of DBS mandate careful assessment of autonomic dysfunction in patients
requiring the treatment in order to choose the appropriate target—when a choice is available—to
avoid undesirable effects that may lead to signiﬁcant morbidity. Beyond that careful target selection,
DBS offers the opportunity for novel therapy modalities that are not possible with conventional medical
therapy. Autonomic drugs, while some are “selective,” generally target receptors throughout the whole
body when only a speciﬁc organ or tissue type is desired, such as the heart or the bladder. DBS has
the potential to add more precision to the arsenal available to physicians. Patients with orthostatic
hypotension, for example, often are normotensive when supine. Pharmaceutical treatment includes
α/β-agonists and adrenergic prodrugs such as droxidopa, which all can cause supine hypertension in
these patients. DBS in concert with an accelerometer or mercury switch activator (that can detect when
the patient is upright) can raise the patient’s blood pressure only while standing, deactivating the
stimulation while the patient is supine [28]. In patients with urinary retention or urinary incontinence,
self-control over activation/deactivation of the pulse generator could allow the patients to turn the
stimulation on or off depending on whether inhibition or induction of micturition is desired given their
condition and where their electrodes have been placed. The technology of DBS is continuing to evolve,
and adaptive DBS (aDBS) will soon be able to adjust stimulation intensity based on a patient’s real-time
clinical condition [73–75]. In addition, there are several ongoing government- and privately-funded
projects aimed at enhancing the speciﬁcity of brain electrical stimulation (e.g., DARPA ElectRx,
GSK electroceuticals).

Abstract: Obesity is a chronic, progressive and prevalent disorder. Morbid obesity, in particular,
is associated with numerous comorbidities and early mortality. In patients with morbid obesity,
pharmacological and behavioral approaches often have limited results. Bariatric surgery is quite
effective but is associated with operative failures and a non-negligible incidence of side effects. In the
last decades, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been investigated as a neurosurgical modality to treat
various neuropsychiatric disorders. In this article we review the rationale for selecting different brain
targets, surgical results and future perspectives for the use of DBS in medically refractory obesity.
Keywords: deep brain stimulation; obesity; hypothalamus; nucleus accumbens

1. Introduction
Obesity is a chronic and progressive disorder with a prevalence of 600 million individuals
worldwide [1]. In 2014, approximately 39% of the adult population was considered to be overweight
and 13% obese [1]. Unfortunately, this number is on the rise [2]. Such an increased incidence is
problematic due to the associated comorbidity and the reduced life expectancy in patients bearing the
disease [3].
Morbid obesity is deﬁned as a body mass index (mass/height2 ) >40 kg/m2 . It affects more than
eight million Americans with a prevalence of approximately 14% [4]. Morbidly obese patients not
only die prematurely, but they also have a poor quality of life [5]. This is due in part to the numerous
co-morbidities associated with the disease, including diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, osteoarthritis,
hepatic steatosis, among others.
A major problem in patients with morbid obesity is that pharmacological and behavioral
approaches often have limited results [6,7]. Surgical interventions, including bariatric procedures,
are currently being used with variable outcomes and a non-negligible incidence of side effects [8].
That said, bariatric surgery is currently the most efﬁcacious treatment for rapid weight loss in morbid
obesity, with overall clinical results superior to those achieved with the best medical management [9,10].
In addition to side effects, a common problem with the bariatric surgery is the relatively high incidence
of recurrence [11]. In fact, recent long-term follow-up studies have shown that up to 46% of patients
may regain weight in the postoperative period [12]. One of the main factors associated with disease

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 21

recurrence is compulsive eating [13,14]. It has now been suggested that patients who present binge
eating disorders or loss of control eating have less weight loss and/or more weight regain after bariatric
surgery [14]. This stresses the fact that obesity cannot be simply regarded as an endocrinological
condition, but as a disease with a strong neuropsychiatric component.
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) involves the delivery of electrical current to the brain parenchyma.
This is accomplished by implanting electrodes into speciﬁc brain targets and connecting them to a
pacemaker (i.e., implantable pulse generator) [15]. The latter is programmed so that current may be
delivered at different amplitudes, pulse widths and frequencies in monopolar or bipolar conﬁgurations.
The electrodes most commonly used today have four different contacts, which may be activated alone
or in combination. Depending on the stimulation parameters and brain target, different neural elements
or circuits may be involved in a DBS response [16]. In recent years, a few reports have been published
using DBS to treat obesity [17–19]. In this article we review the rationale for selecting different brain
targets, surgical results and future perspectives of using DBS for treating medically refractory obesity.
2. Anatomical Targets
The pathophysiology of obesity involves not only altered patterns of eating and satiety but also
reward and compulsive aspects of food intake. As such, DBS targets currently proposed to treat obesity
include the hypothalamus and nucleus accumbens (NAc) [20,21].
The hypothalamus may be subdivided in various anatomical and functional subregions/nuclei.
Some of the most commonly involved in mechanisms of feeding and energy balance are the arcuate
nucleus (ARC), the dorsal medial nucleus, the paraventricular nucleus, the lateral hypothalamus
(LH) and the ventral medial nucleus (VM). An in-depth review of the neurocircuitry of feeding
and satiety, including all the cell types and peptides involved, may be found elsewhere [22–24].
Of particular interest are the VM and LH, as these nuclei are being considered as potential targets
for DBS surgery. The VM is a relatively large nucleus with an abundance of leptin receptors [22].
Leptin and insulin provide the hypothalamus with peripheral signals of adiposity [25]. If levels of
these hormones are high, the organism reduces feeding. In the hypothalamus, prominent levels
of leptin and insulin receptors may also be found in ARC [22,24]. In this nucleus, these hormones
modulate activity of populations of cells expressing neuropeptide Y/agouti gene-related protein
and cocaine- and amphetamine-related transcript (CART)/pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) [22,26].
In general, states of negative energy deﬁcit (e.g., starvation) increase the activity of ARC NPY/AGRP
neurons, ultimately favoring food consumption. Overall, ARC NPY/AGRP neurons project to most
hypothalamic nuclei involved in feeding control [22].
The LH extends through most of the anteropoesterior axis of the hypothalamus [27]. It is composed
of diffuse populations of neurons intermingled with ﬁbers, largely from the medial forebrain bundle
(MFB) [27]. Subpopulations of cells in LH express different peptides and hormones, including orexins
and melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH). Both have orexigenic effects and tend to increase food
consumption [22,27].
In contrast to the hypothalamus, the NAc has been suggested to play a role in rewarding aspects
of food intake and compulsive feeding. Some of the evidence suggesting an involvement of the
NAc in the pathophysiology of obesity includes the following: the pattern of compulsive eating
shown in some forms of clinical and preclinical obesity often resembles that of drug addiction [28–30].
Food craving and the anticipation of food reward in preclinical models are associated with changes
in D2 striatal receptors [31]. In rodents, binging on sugar and the ingestion of fat diets increase the
release of dopamine in the NAc [32,33]. In addition to the above-mentioned evidence, numerous
neuroimaging studies using positron emission tomography or functional magnetic resonance imaging
have been conducted in obese patients at baseline and during activation tasks (for a review see [34,
35]). Overall, sensory stimuli related to palatable foods seem to activate cortical regions and the
reward circuitry, including the ventral striatum [34,35]. In some studies, hyper-responsiveness of
reward-related regions has been suggested to forecast a poor outcome to weight-loss programs [36].

191

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 21

Though not a consensus, studies in obese patients treated with bariatric surgery have shown that the
response of the ventral striatum to images of caloric food is less pronounced than that recorded prior
to surgery [37]. Also commonly investigated with neuroimaging is the status of the dopaminergic
system. Though results are not consistent across trials, a few studies have shown that food-related
sensory stimuli elicit dopamine release and that obese individuals have a low D2 binding in the
striatum [34,35,38–40].
3. Preclinical Studies
Based on studies in which lesions, pharmacological agents and electrical stimulation were applied
to the hypothalamus, as well as on clinical cases of patients with brain tumors, the VM and LH
have been suggested as being “satiety” and “feeding” hypothalamic centers, respectively [41–43].
Though this “dual center hypothesis” is somewhat outdated, much has been learned from experiments
manipulating hypothalamic regions to investigate mechanisms and neurocircuits of food intake and
satiety. Early preclinical work in which either the VM or LH were lesioned or pharmacologically
inhibited has shown an increase in feeding or satiety, respectively [44,45]. In contrast to the relative
uniformity of conclusions reached by the above-mentioned studies, results with the use of electrical
stimulation are far more complex. As the hypothalamus is involved in numerous physiological
functions, stimulation of different nuclei may inﬂuence multiple physiologic processes. In addition,
current may spill over and modulate activity in adjacent nuclei and nearby structures, including the
fornix and medial forebrain bundle. Stimulation delivered to the VM of rodents [46–49], dogs [50],
mini-pigs [51], and nonhuman primates [52] at settings known to drive neurons and axonal projections
has been shown to alter feeding behavior, the type of food ingested and/or has slowed down weight
gain over time. However, these results are not consistent with a few studies in these same species
showing that stimulation may not be effective [53] or even increase food consumption [54]. Though part
of the discrepancies across studies may be explained by the use of different stimulation settings
(e.g., 50 vs. 130 Hz and targeted regions), this is still not able to fully explain why studies using
similar paradigms, targeting somewhat analogous regions, reached different conclusions. As for the
LH, initial studies in rodents [55,56] and felines [57] have largely shown that stimulation induced
feeding. Part of those ﬁndings, however, has been attributed to the stimulation of structures adjacent
to the LH, such as the medial forebrain bundle [27]. The MFB is comprised of axonal projections
that interconnect over 50 brainstem, subcortical and cortical regions, including those involved in
mechanisms of reward (e.g., LH, nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area). In contrast to earlier
reports, however, recent studies in rodents using high frequency stimulation (e.g., above 100 Hz) have
shown that LH DBS may reduce weight gain over time [58,59].
In contrast to the long history of hypothalamic stimulation for obesity, studies in which the
nucleus accumbens was targeted in animal models are much more recent. Lesions of the NAc in
rodents decrease food-hoarding behavior and are associated with weight loss [60]. Stimulation of
the NAc shell delivered for 14 days to diet-induced obese rats led to signiﬁcant reductions in total
energy intake and weight gain, an effect that was associated with an up-regulation of the D2 receptor
and increased DA levels [61]. Mice treated with NAc shell DBS were found to have a decrease in
binge eating and an increase in immediate early gene expression in this same region [62]. D2 receptor
antagonists attenuated DBS effects. In diet-induced obese mice, chronic NAc shell DBS has been found
to reduce caloric intake and lead to weight loss. In rodents, stimulation of the accumbens core has also
been shown to reduce binge eating [63].
4. Clinical Studies
Stereotactic ablative surgery targeting the hypothalamus for the treatment of obesity was initially
been carried 40 years ago [64,65]. Overall, the procedure was proven to be safe, resulting in signiﬁcant,
though transient (e.g., few weeks), reductions in appetite and weight loss.

192

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 21

In 2008, Hamani et al. reported on a single patient with obesity treated with hypothalamic
DBS [17]. Postoperative reconstruction of the electrode placement has shown that contacts used for
stimulation were located near the fornix. While no weight changes were observed with high frequency
DBS (130 Hz), when stimulated at 3.0–4.0 V, 210 μsec and 50 Hz, the patient lost 12 kg over ﬁve months.
This was not due to signiﬁcant dietary changes but to a reduction in food craving [17]. Over time,
however, the patient reported that he was unable to sleep with the system activated and started
turning it off at night. Without stimulation, he began nighttime binging and regained the weight he
had lost [17].
In a more recent trial, Whiting et al. reported on the safety, efﬁcacy and calorimetric effects of LH
DBS in patients with obesity followed for an average of 35 months [18]. The three individuals in that
study were diagnosed with refractory morbid obesity, which included a failure of bariatric surgery.
Several scales were applied to assess the effects of DBS on eating and quality of life, including the
Gormally Binge Eating Scale, the Cognitive Restraint subscale (used to assess dieting skills), a hunger
scale, the Body Shape Questionnaire, and the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life–Lite Questionnaire.
Though one of the participants had postoperative improvements in some of these scales, overall testing
suggested that DBS did not induce signiﬁcant changes. Also unchanged after DBS were blood tests to
measure nutritional status, pituitary hormones, and neuroendocrine/neuropeptide studies. The most
striking aspect of the trial was that DBS signiﬁcantly increased resting metabolic state (RMR) in
two patients. In these subjects, RMR improvement was in the order of 28% and 9%. Despite this fact,
no consistent weight changes were noticed. DBS settings were 90 μsec, 185 Hz at different stimulation
voltages [18].
In 2016, Harat and colleagues implanted NAc DBS electrodes in a 19-year-old patient who developed
hypothalamic obesity following the onset and surgery for the removal of a craniopharyngioma [19].
Her weight before surgery was 151.4 kg. Three months after DBS she weighed 132 kg. Over time,
her weight fluctuated due to a few instances in which the pacemaker was accidentally switched off. At the
last follow-up visit (14 months after DBS), her weight was 138 kg. During periods in which the electrodes
were found to be off, she reported increased food craving. This is of importance, as reductions in food
craving and compulsive eating are some of the mechanisms through which NAc DBS has been postulated
to exert its effects. Settings used in that study were 2–3.75 mA, 130 Hz and 208 μsec [19].
5. Future Perspectives and Applications of DBS in Obesity
To date, experience with DBS for obesity is quite limited. Overall, surgery has been proven to be
safe, but no deﬁnitive conclusions can be made as to whether it is effective. Despite the number of
studies published in animal models, several clinical aspects are still unclear, including target selection,
the kinetics of DBS, or ideal stimulation parameters. Also unknown is whether DBS will work on
genetic forms of obesity.
Prader Willi Syndrome (PWS) is one of the main causes of genetic obesity during childhood.
Approximately 70% of patients have a deletion in chromosome 15 (15q11–q13) [66,67]. Of the
remainder of patients, 25% have maternal uniparental disomy and 5% have imprinting defects.
In infants and children, PWS is characterized by hypotonia, delayed neuropsychological development,
lower-than-expected growth, hypogonadism, and hyperphagia [68,69]. Severe to morbid obesity is
the most relevant problem of the syndrome due to associated comorbidities and early mortality.
Hyperphagia in PWS is often refractory to pharmacological and psychotherapeutic approaches,
as well as bariatric surgery [70]. Several factors suggest that the increased appetite in PWS may
be associated with hypothalamic dysfunction [71]. First, the disease is comprised of a spectrum
of hormonal problems (e.g., low levels of growth hormone, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism,
temperature dysregulation). Post-mortem studies in patients with PWS have shown a reduced number
of cells in the paraventricular nucleus, including neurons that synthesize anorexigenic hormones
and oxytocin [72]. In PWS, imaging studies have shown an increased activation of reward circuits
when patients are presented with food stimuli [73]. Bearing these facts in mind, DBS in either the

193

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 21

hypothalamus or NAc has been hypothesized as a suitable alternative for the treatment of patients
with PWS [74,75].
Another aspect that deserves to be discussed is the advancement of DBS technology, which may
improve the delivery of stimulation to some of the targets discussed above. The hypothalamus is a
small structure responsible for modulating various physiological functions. In this target, directional
leads could certainly be of help to steer current into speciﬁc regions while avoiding spread to adjacent
undesirable structures [76,77]. This may, in theory, improve safety and reduce the incidence of
stimulation-induced side effects.
6. Conclusions
Data from animal studies and preliminary reports in humans suggest that DBS may be a promising
alternative for the treatment of obesity. Structures involved in mechanisms of feeding and rewarding
aspects of food intake, namely the hypothalamus and NAc, have been considered as potential targets.
Though surgery was shown to be safe in the few patients treated so far, further studies are still needed
not only to better characterize the side effect proﬁle of these procedures but also their actual efﬁcacy.
As in previous functional neurosurgery studies, trials on DBS for obesity have to take several
issues into account. Inclusion criteria should be strict, with a clearly deﬁned diagnosis, measures of
refractoriness and recruitment of patients with severe forms of the disease. In addition, trials need
to be carried out in an ethical manner [78–80], with particular attention paid to the informed consent
process, long-term follow up, clinical care and support. Ideally, patients should be assessed by a
multidisciplinary team of endocrinologists, neurosurgeons, psychiatrists and neuropsychologists,
so that comprehensive care may be provided.
In summary, results of preclinical and early clinical trials using DBS for obesity have been
promising. However, numerous questions remain unanswered, including the optimal target, stimulation
parameters, and clinical aspects of the patients to be included (e.g., previous failure to bariatric surgery,
compulsive eating, among other). Further work is certainly needed to address these issues.

Abstract: The efficacy of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) for an expanding array of neurological
and psychiatric disorders demonstrates directly that DBS affects the basic electroneurophysiological
mechanisms of the brain. The increasing array of active electrode configurations, stimulation currents,
pulse widths, frequencies, and pulse patterns provides valuable tools to probe electroneurophysiological
mechanisms. The extension of basic electroneurophysiological and anatomical concepts using
sophisticated computational modeling and simulation has provided relatively straightforward
explanations of all the DBS parameters except frequency. This article summarizes current thought
about frequency and relevant observations. Current methodological and conceptual errors are critically
examined in the hope that future work will not replicate these errors. One possible alternative theory
is presented to provide a contrast to many current theories. DBS, conceptually, is a noisy discrete
oscillator interacting with the basal ganglia–thalamic–cortical system of multiple re-entrant, discrete
oscillators. Implications for positive and negative resonance, stochastic resonance and coherence, noisy
synchronization, and holographic memory (related to movement generation) are presented. The time
course of DBS neuronal responses demonstrates evolution of the DBS response consistent with the
dynamics of re-entrant mechanisms. Finally, computational modeling demonstrates identical dynamics
as seen by neuronal activities recorded from human and nonhuman primates, illustrating the differences
of discrete from continuous harmonic oscillators and the power of conceptualizing the nervous system
as composed on interacting discrete nonlinear oscillators.
Keywords: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS); stimulation frequency; discrete nonlinear oscillators;
stochastic resonance; basal ganglia–thalamic–cortical system of oscillators; Principle of Causational

1. The Conundrum of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) Frequency
The effects of speciﬁc electrode conﬁgurations, the set of active cathodes and anodes, can be
understood to relate to the regional anatomy and the volume of tissue activation. While the effects
of stimulation parameters, such as stimulation current (voltage) and pulse width, can be understood
as related to activation of neuronal axonal elements mediated by the presence or absence of myelin,
axonal diameter, and chronaxie, how DBS frequency controls the response is much more problematic [1].
From the perspective of information transfer between neurons, such as those activated directly by the
DBS pulse and the subsequent postsynaptic neurons, DBS frequency could have an effect on temporal
summation. Such temporal summation would be important in propagating the DBS effect through
a long sequence of interactions, ultimately affecting the orchestration of motor unit activities that
mediate the clinical motor responses to DBS. However, the frequencies used typically in DBS are not

very effective at temporal summation [2], and thus the mechanisms by which DBS frequencies affect
motor control likely are through some other mechanism(s).
The neurophysiology of the DBS frequency effect is an enigma and likely will require novel
attempts to explicate. This article takes on this challenge, proceeding from the hypothesis that DBS can
be considered a nonlinear discrete noise oscillator that is interjected into the nonlinear polysynaptic
re-entrant discrete oscillators that comprise the basal ganglia–thalamic–cortical system. Whether this
will illuminate the issue of DBS frequency effects requires the test of time. However, the theory requires
the introduction of novel or, at the very least, unfamiliar concepts—hence the review-like nature of
the article; these will be in addition to novel observations, hence the presentation of experiments.
The format provides a signiﬁcant advantage in the opportunity to make a full proposal with the mutual
reinforcement or consilience of the many parts not typically available in most journals.
The ﬁrst effort is to demonstrate just how complex the effect of varying DBS frequencies is,
in this case the effect of various DBS frequencies in the vicinity of the subthalamic nucleus on
bradykinesia in patients with Parkinson’s disease, and to account for the failure of such complexity
to be appreciated previously. There is considerable experience that demonstrates beneﬁts from
low-frequency DBS, for example of the STN for gait disturbances and for dystonia. Further, there may
be differences in the frequency-dependent responses for different symptoms and signs of Parkinson’s
disease. The failure to appreciate this complexity, although it has long been suspected by astute
clinicians, is both methodological and due to conceptual presuppositions. Thus, the review aspects
of this article necessarily have an epistemological and historical bent. Also, it will be necessary to
provide evidence of highly complex neural oscillators intrinsic to the basal ganglia–thalamic–cortical
systems. Further, these oscillations are tied to the orchestration of motor unit behaviors that necessarily
mediate the motoric effects of DBS. Next, the power of DBS to induce oscillations is discussed.
Finally, preliminary evidence of complex interactions between the DBS oscillator and intrinsic
oscillators in the subthalamic nucleus is presented.
The authors ask the indulgence of the reader. This is not a systematic review of all the publications
that address the issue of DBS frequency. Such an effort is far beyond the opportunity reasonably
offered by the editors. Thus, it is impossible to acknowledge the individual contributions made by
many clinicians and scientists. This should not be taken as a judgment of their contributions or as
a slight of any kind, rather a practical necessity. Second, this is a critique in the robust sense of the
term. The critique recognizes that the issue of DBS frequency-based mechanisms is far from a complete
understanding. Rather, considerable more research and scholarly efforts will be necessary. The strong
critique is not a matter of fault-ﬁnding but more an effort so that future scientists and clinicians do
not make the same mistakes that these authors and others have made. The term “error” as applied to
any ﬁnding, inference, or conclusion is not a pejorative term. It is a wise person who learns from their
mistakes; it a wiser person who learns from the mistakes of others. If one wants to change the future
then one must see the present and the best way to see the present is to clearly see the past.
No theory or hypothesis arises spontaneously but rather is the consequence of a long history of
reasoning. Reasoning laboriously worked through, perhaps centuries ago—for example by Aristotle
(384–322 B.C.E.), now may be forgotten or taken for granted as a presupposition but is no less
relevant. This fact was not lost on some of the greatest neuroscientists, such as Sir Charles Sherrington.
Any competent critique must trace the conceptual antecedents as far back as is necessary to fully
inform the review. It would be naïve, at best, or petulant, at worse, to discount analyses and wisdom
from any age.
2. Conceptual History
Historically, the study of the effects of DBS frequencies has dichotomized the frequencies into high
and low. This article demonstrates that such dichotomization is the result of a methodological error
reinforced by highly intuitive conceptual appeal, also probably in error. This is not to say that clinicians
did not see a difference when they stimulated at high frequencies compared to low frequencies. Rather,

202

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 34

one error lies in undersampling in the frequency domain, resulting in aliasing. This is not a matter of
opinion but rather a direct consequence of the Nyquist theorem. Another error lies in the pooling of
results across subjects when the intersubject variability is high. The result is information loss according
to the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The study by Huang et al. [3] demonstrates the effects of
these errors.
Results of the study by Huang et al. [3] demonstrate that a number of DBS frequencies over
a wide range for any individual subject resulted in improved bradykinesia as measured by hand
opening–closing (Figure 1). If only a few DBS frequencies are studied, the result would likely
demonstrate aliasing, and it will appear as though the relationship between improvement and
DBS frequency is a monotonically increasing function, which it is not in reality. Further, there was
considerable intersubject variability, suggesting that pooling subjects would have obscured the true
relationship between improvement and DBS frequency.

Figure 1. Patients with Parkinson’s disease executed rapid hand opening and closing while wearing
a glove that recorded ﬁnger and thumb movements. Following an overnight fast, these patients
received their ﬁrst dose of medications used to treat Parkinson’s. Movements of the ﬁngers were
separated from those of the thumb. The movement amplitudes were normalized by scaling from 0 to 1
where 1 represents the maximum amplitude. The mean over all the movements was analyzed: (A) for
the thumb and (B) for the ﬁngers (pooled across all the ﬁngers) for each subject. Absence of a column
indicates that the associated stimulation frequency was unavailable with the subject’s Implanted
Pulse Generator (IPG). Multiple peaks in amplitude movements are found across multiple frequencies,
including low frequencies. (Inserts) Amplitudes for the lower range of stimulation frequencies are
shown in the expanded window [3].

The implications of the study by Huang et al. [3] go beyond the methodological (epistemological)
to the reality (ontology) of the physiology of relevant parts of the nervous system, such as the basal
ganglia–thalamic–cortical system. It is at least interesting that many years have passed since Cooper
and colleagues’ description of DBS as presently implemented in 1980 [4] and popularized by Benabid
and colleagues in 1987 [5] before the issue of DBS frequency was evaluated systematically over a range
of frequencies. One wonders why.
Perhaps the need to study the range of frequencies systematically did not raise sufﬁcient concern.
However, this could only be the case if the prior concept of a dichotomous effect of DBS frequency was
thought to be sufﬁcient. Further, there is nothing in past observations that would be evidence that
such a dichotomous effect is sufﬁcient. At the very least, it could demonstrate the Fallacy of Limited
203

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 34

Alternatives, where one explanation is considered more certain (falsely) when some alternatives
are eliminated or not considered. However, for the one explanation to be certain, all reasonable
alternatives would have to be considered and excluded, which, in the case of the effects of DBS
frequencies, was not done.
Perhaps it was that the dichotomization of the effects of DBS frequencies seemed valid because of
the analogy between pallidotomy and DBS in the vicinity of the globus pallidus interna. The logical
fallacy of this analogy has been discussed elsewhere [6]. Interestingly, the contemporaneous theory of
the pathophysiology of movement disorders, at theory positing excessive or reduced activity in the
neurons of the globus pallidus interna (Globus Pallidus Interna (GPi Rate Theory)), was used to argue
in favor of the analogy [7]. Considerable evidence shows that this notion of pathophysiology is no
longer tenable [8].
The concerns raised here are more than historical. Successor theories likely share the same fatal
ﬂaw as the GPi Rate theory and therefore are at risk of delaying better theories. Current theories that
posit excessive oscillations in the beta frequency range or excessive synchronization, along with the
GPi Rate theory, share one-dimensional push–pull dynamics. At the very least, alternative theories
that do not share these dynamics should be considered, particularly in view of the risks associated
with the Fallacy of Limited Alternatives.
Given the lack of direct evidence, the presupposition of a dichotomous effect of DBS frequency
then appears to be a default. Actually, dichotomization of phenomena and inferred causes marks
human reasoning for millennia. Dichotomization is a consequence of the human epistemic condition.
The inherent tendency to such a dichotomy, in appropriate circumstances, represents a pitfall only
avoided if appreciated. Below the case is made for the ubiquity of dichotomization and, ultimately,
its relevance to the consideration of DBS frequencies.
These dynamics were codiﬁed by Aristotle in his notion of contraries, where Aristotle wrote:
“The physicists ( . . . ) have two modes of explanation. The ﬁrst set make the underlying
body one—either one of the three or something else which is denser than ﬁre and rarer than
air—then generate everything else from this, and obtain in multiplicity by condensation
and rarefaction. Now these are contraries which may be generalized into ‘excess and defect’
(italics added)” [9].
Aristotle’s notion was extended by Galen (129–c. 200/c. 216, C.E.) in his notion of one-dimensional
push–pull dynamics of relative excess or deﬁciencies of the humors. Galen’s dynamics continue
underlying neurological and psychiatric therapeutics [10]. John Hughlings Jackson (1835–1911),
one of history’s preeminent and deﬁning neurologists, held a notion of positive and negative
symptoms mediated by facilitation, inhibition, and inhibition of inhibition to release facilitation,
continues to underlie mainstream neurological thinking. As neurology was the source of neuroscience,
historically, it is not unexpected that the conceptual foundations of neurology would inﬂuence those
of neuroscience. This inheritance is evident in the facilitation and inhibition of a hierarchy of reﬂex
mechanisms in the work of Sir Charles Sherrington (1857–1952) in his Integrative Action of the Nervous
System [11]. The one-dimensional push–pull dynamics are apparent in the descriptions of Phineas
Gauge, where damage to the frontal lobes impaired the ability to suppress antisocial behavior, although
the source or mechanism that produces antisocial behavior, thought to be released, has never been
made clear.
Needed now is a Kuhnian paradigm shift [12] away from paradigms that presuppose
one-dimensional push–pull dynamics. Despite celebrations written in Science and Nature 50 years
after publication of The Structure of Scientiﬁc Revolutions [12], Kuhn’s work continues to invite critique,
fairly, but outright rejection by reasonable thinkers would be to make an oxymoron of the latter.
Kuhn’s work was ﬁrst and foremost a historical analysis. The uneven progress of science, even to the
point of “getting stuck,” is a matter of historical fact. Such is the case as it relates to current theories
of the pathophysiology of the basal ganglia–thalamic–cortical system as it informs hypotheses of the
mechanisms of action of DBS, particularly as it relates to frequency.
204

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 34

Thomas Kuhn (1922–1996) argued that a paradigm shift occurs when observations unexplainable
by the dominant paradigm—anomalies—accumulate to some breaking point. Kuhn left unexplained
what the dynamics of the breaking point were, but many critics of science argue that the breaking
point is a polemical issue. At what point do editors of scientiﬁc journals and grant administrators
stop being accepting of failed paradigms? For example, almost since the inception of the GPi
Rate theory, there have been contrary observations and anomalies, including the production of
Parkinsonism in nonhuman primates with N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, that fail
to demonstrate predictions of the GPi Rate theory [13], as well as demonstrating that pallidotomy
improves hyperkinetic disorders contrary to the predictions. However, the GPi Rate theory persists
even today, attesting to the ability of an intuitively appealing theory to trump fact [14].
3. Some Principles for Developing Alternative Theories
This critique is written with an eye to the future in the hope that much better hypotheses and
theories will arise that, when vindicated, will extend our knowledge. There are some generic principles
that may be helpful. Any theory is more than a set of facts and includes hypotheses that bridge
gaps (interpolate) and extrapolate from observations to predictions. Hypotheses invoke notions
of necessity and causality that go beyond correlations. However, the generation and evaluation
of hypotheses in themselves are poorly understood and have been explained as happenstance,
psychological, or aesthetic. However, Aristotle and other ancient Greek philosophers offered
an important requirement called the Principle of Causational Synonymy that imposes constraints on
any hypothesis and theory that posits some causal mechanism, such as changes in neuronal activities
that cause, denigrate, or restore normal behavior. The Principle of Causational Synonymy holds that
the means by which a cause acts to generate an effect must match the means in the effect that generates
an effect. For example, when one pushes an object, the electrons in the outer orbit of the atoms on
the surface of the hand repel the electrons in the other orbit of the atoms on the surface of the object.
In the case of understanding the motor effects of DBS, these effects are through the recruitment and
de-recruitment of motor units, as is discussed latter. As per the Principle of Causational Synonymy,
no theory of the mechanisms of action of DBS can be considered complete or satisfactory without
full explication of motor unit activities. Indeed, the inability of any theory or explanation to do so is
evidence of serious shortcomings.
The Principle of Causational Synonymy can be extended to a Principle of Informational Synonymy.
Considering information as nonrandom state changes, the nonrandom state changes, such as the
frequency by which electrostatic charges are placed, reversed, and then stopped on the electrical
contact of the DBS lead (the cause), must be synonymous with the neuronal changes in the vicinity of
the DBS target that generate the DBS effect. Thus, both with the Principle of Causational Synonymy
and the Principle of Informational Synonymy, there must be precise mapping of the dynamics of the
causal agent with the effector agent.
Consider the situation of a person pushing a child on a swing. In addition to the repulsive forces
in the appropriate electrons in the person and the child, there also is informational content in terms of
the movements of the person pushing and the child swing. This is evident in the fact that the person
pushing cannot push at any random time. Rather, the person pushing must be in phase with the
child’s swing. Further, the pushing and swinging must be at the same frequencies, consistent with the
Principle of Information Synonymy.
Applying these principles to the theories of DBS mechanisms of action, particularly as it relates to
the stimulation pattern, in this case frequency, shows that current concepts are inadequate. Start with
the effect, in this case the normalization of movement in the case of DBS for Parkinson’s disease.
Ultimately, any changes in the movement must be implemented by orchestrating the recruitment
and de-recruitment of motor units over a number of muscles. This orchestration is very complex and
operates over multiple levels over varying time scales. This includes the recruitment of motor units by
size. Reciprocal coordination exists between muscles agonistic and antagonistic to the intended joint

205

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 34

rotation. Synergistic coordination of motor unit recruitments and de-recruitments in muscles spanning
the same joint can be extended to motor unit orchestration simultaneously over multiple joints. Each of
these operates at different time scales, and if related to oscillators in the nervous system (as will be
demonstrated), then each time scale implies multiple oscillators at corresponding frequencies. Further,
the operations at different frequencies are organized simultaneously. These issues are addressed in
detail in Montgomery [15].
The fact that DBS improves motor control at speciﬁc frequencies argues that the frequency of
the DBS is interacting in a nonrandom oscillatory manner with analogous oscillators within the basal
ganglia-thalamic-cortical system. Indeed, as will be argued for, DBS can be considered as introducing
an additional oscillator into the network of oscillators that comprises the basal ganglia-thalamic-cortical
system. As discussed later, these oscillators are a speciﬁc kind that endows them with very important
and interesting properties. The fact that multiple DBS frequencies exist shows that there are multiple
oscillators of corresponding frequencies within the basal ganglia-thalamic-cortical system.
A possible alternative theory is presented here. The purpose here is to highlight alternative
conceptions and not necessarily to champion any one particular theory. This is consistent with the
intent of providing a critique rather than a review. To the authors’ knowledge, the proposed theory is
rather novel, at least in literature searches of various databases, thus providing a study of contrast.
For example, there is no other publication searchable in PubMed that discusses motor unit recruitment
abnormalities in Parkinson’s disease or the effects of DBS. Nor are there any publications on discrete
neural oscillators. Understandably, research bearing on the alternative theory largely will be those
pursued by the authors. The theory advanced here includes the following:

The basal ganglia–thalamic–cortical system is involved in the recruitment and de-recruitment of
motor units through oscillators within the system that then drive the motor cortex and brainstem
structures that project to the lower motor neurons of the spinal cord and brainstem.
The basal ganglia-thalamic-cortical system is composed of multiple loosely coupled re-entrant,
nonlinear polysynaptic discrete oscillators (Figure 2). Note that the term “discrete” is emphasized,
as nearly all discussions of oscillators within the context of DBS, physiology, and pathophysiology
do not make a distinction between continuous harmonic oscillators and discrete oscillators.
These two types of oscillators have very different properties and dynamics. This theory was
described previously in general terms [16] and in more detail in Montgomery [1].

Figure 2. Schematic representation of the various components of the basal ganglia–thalamic–cortical
system, demonstrating three oscillator architectures out of a greater number of possible oscillators.
Represented are the following various structures: 1, putamen (as representative of the striatum);
2, globus pallidus externa; 3, globus pallidus interna; 4, subthalamic nucleus; 5, substantia nigra
pars reticulata; 6, substantia nigra pars compacta (location of the cell bodies that utilize dopamine
as their neurotransmitter); 7, ventral thalamus pars oralis; 8, parafasicular and centromedian nuclei
of the thalamus; 9, supplementary motor area; and 10, primary motor cortex. Note that the GPi
participates in two different oscillators, each of which is associated with a different fundamental
frequency—a ﬁve-node loop and a six-node loop [1].

Oscillatory states consist of oscillators representing different frequencies simultaneously and that
oscillatory states can shift dynamically, in the manner of a bifurcation in Complex Systems.
DBS acts as a noisy discrete oscillator when introduced into the basal ganglia-thalamic-cortical
system, which interacts with oscillators inherent to the basal ganglia-thalamic-cortical system.
Interaction of the DBS oscillator within the oscillatory network is a model of mechanisms inherent
in the basal ganglia-thalamic-cortical system, both in normal and in pathological circumstances.
These interactions include the following:

Positive and negative stochastic resonance
Noisy synchronization

4. Evidence for a Role of the Basal Ganglia-Thalamic-Cortical System in Motor Unit Recruitment
and De-Recruitment
Oscillator activities in motor unit behaviors have been known, and perhaps underappreciated,
since described by Piper in 1907 [17]. At high muscle contractions, a 40-Hz signal can be appreciated,
not only by electromyographic (EMG) recordings but also by auscultation using a stethoscope [18].
The genesis of such oscillatory activity is not known but likely is of central nervous system origin [19,20].
The question arises whether the basal ganglia via the motor cortex plays a role in these motor unit
oscillations speciﬁcally, as suggested by abnormalities of the Piper rhythm in patients with Parkinson’s
and motor unit orchestration generally.
Motor unit recruitment normally is organized based on the muscular force at which a motor unit
becomes active. The phenomenology of motor unit recruitment order is the recruitment of small motor
units with low force requirements followed by a recruitment of larger motor units with a greater force
requirement and is known as the Henneman Size Principle. Small motor units generated are thought
to provide the small forces necessary for ﬁne resolution of the forces generated, whereas large motor
units supply the strength.
Another important extrapolation from the phenomenology is to the underlying mechanisms.
Initially, it was hypothesized that motor unit recruitment was determined by the local biophysical
properties of the lower motor neuron with large lower motor neurons, corresponding to larger motor
units, being harder to excite. Subsequently, differential synaptic inputs with respect to lower motor
neuron size, particularly peripheral afferents, were postulated to play a role. Nevertheless, most studies
have not discussed or have discounted the role of descending inputs. Indeed, Enoka writes, “The great
advantage of a spinally based control scheme (recruitment order determined by motor neuron
biophysics—authors), such as orderly recruitment, is that it relieves higher centers (for example,
the basal ganglia—authors) of the responsibility to select the motor neurons that must be activated
for a speciﬁc task” [21]. Thus, it is not surprising that Parkinson’s disease’s effects on motor unit
recruitment order have not received much attention.
In a study of motor unit recruitment [22], subjects were recruited from patients implanted
previously with DBS systems in the vicinity of the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Following an overnight
fast from their usual medications used to treat Parkinson’s disease, subjects placed their extended
ﬁnger and wrists into a manipulandum through which they could exert an isometric ﬂexor force
about the wrist. The task was to exert a force starting at rest to their maximum voluntary force
over 60 s. Fine wire hook electrodes were inserted into the ﬂexor carpi ulnaris. An example is
shown in Figure 3. A raw EMG is shown in the top panel of Figure 3 under the condition of
therapeutic DBS in the vicinity of the subthalamic nucleus. The therapeutic DBS electrode conﬁguration
and stimulation parameters were those determined optimal during prior routine clinical care with
frequencies at least greater than 100 pps. As can be appreciated readily, there is a step-like increase in
the amplitudes of the motor unit potentials with increasing force, clearly consistent with the Henneman
Size Principle. However, under the condition of no DBS in the same subject, the step-like increase

207

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 34

is not seen. Further, large amplitude motor unit potentials are seen early in the task at low forces,
clearly inconsistent with the Henneman Size Principle.

Figure 3. Representative example of raw intramuscular electromyographic (EMG) activities in a subject
with Parkinson’s disease under conditions of 160 pulses per second (pps) DBS (therapeutic) and 0 pps
DBS. The raw EMG under 160 pps DBS has a stair-step appearance. Each step is associated with
recruitment of a larger motor unit. The same six motor units were identiﬁed under both conditions
and their waveforms and size are shown. The waveform associated with each motor unit is distinct
and varies in size from its fellows. The size was determined by measuring the area under the curve.
The time of occurrence of a motor unit discharge appears in the raster, with one row for each motor
unit. The red arrow indicates onset of activities as the force generated increases progressively. In the
160-pps DBS condition, an orderly recruitment is shown (indicated by red arrows): Consistent with
the Henneman Size Principle, smaller units are recruited ﬁrst, followed by progressively larger motor
units. Under the 0-pps DBS condition, the orderly recruitment of motor units is lost and the units are
recruited nearly simultaneously. Large motor units are recruited early in the task and at small forces.

The EMG signals associated with individual motor units were extracted using a template-matching
algorithm [23] to identify individual waveforms. Subsequently, another computer program used
these waveforms as the basis to decompose superimposed signals into the elemental waveforms,
allowing discrimination of individual motor units to higher percentages of maximal force production.
Curve ﬁtting of a sigmoidal function to cumulative discharge histograms over the ramp force allowed
determination of the force at which the motor unit was recruited. The force at recruitment was
correlated with the motor unit size determined by the area under the curve of the motor unit potential
waveform (Figure 4). A positive slope indicates consistency with the Henneman Size Principle.
As can be seen in Figure 4 for a subject with Parkinson’s disease, the slopes are near or less
than 0 with the stimulator off or at 20 pps. With higher frequency DBS, the slopes become more
positive. Indeed, the therapeutic DBS frequency resulted in the greatest positive slope. The reasonable
conclusion is that the Henneman Size Principle is violated without treatment but is restored with
higher frequencies of DBS. Figure 5 shows results comparing slopes for patients in the DBS Off (0 pps)
and DBS On (therapeutic pps) for another patient. As can be seen, there was a near reversal of the
normal recruitment pattern. Large motor units were recruited at the lowest forces generated and the
small motor units only at the highest force. The motor recruitment changed to what would normally be
208

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 34

expected with therapeutic DBS. Slopes under the different conditions for 14 subjects with Parkinson’s
disease and 10 normal subjects are shown in Figure 6.
The question is what accounts for restoration of the normal motor unit recruitment proﬁle with
high-frequency therapeutic DBS and the dependence on frequency as shown in Figure 4. Changes in
the recruitment order may be mediated by the motor cortex, whose upper motor neurons project to the
lower motor neurons of the motor unit. Studies in nonhuman primates and in humans demonstrate
a short latency highly temporally consistent with antidromic activations in motor cortex neurons
in response to DBS pulses applied in the vicinity of the subthalamic nucleus. Evidence also shows
an antidromic activation of the cortex in response to DBS in the vicinity of the subthalamic nucleus in
humans with Parkinson’s disease [24]. However, there were subsequent responses at longer latencies
that suggest the possibility of re-entrant oscillations. Such an effect is demonstrated more clearly in
the recording of neurons in the ventral thalamus pars oralis in response to DBS in the vicinity of the
globus pallidus interna (Figure 7). The buildup of responses at approximately 5 ms following the DBS
pulse suggests a resonance effect.

Figure 4. Relationship between percent of maximum force at which each of the seven motor units
were recruited and the size of the motor units for different DBS conditions for a representative subject
with Parkinson’s disease. The seven motor units (A–G) are ordered according to motor unit size: A is
the smallest and G is the largest. Different symbols and colors represent the various DBS conditions.
A ﬂat or small slope indicates that the Henneman Size Principle did not hold under that DBS condition.
An initially relatively ﬂat slope for the untreated patient (0 Hz DBS) increases greatly with therapeutic
(high) DBS, suggesting that motor unit recruitment has become normalized.

Figure 5. An example of the relationship between the size of the motor units and the percentages
of maximum voluntary force at which the motor unit was recruited. In the DBS Off condition,
the recruitment is opposite that predicted by the Henneman Size Principle. The recruitment became
what would normally be expected by the principle.

Figure 6. Summary of the changes in slopes of the motor unit recruitment order for 14 patients off and
on therapeutic DBS compared to 10 normal controls.

Figure 7. Some ventral thalamus pars oralis neurons (designated VL) demonstrate a remarkable
posthyperpolarization (postinhibitory) rebound increased excitability (C). A potential mechanism is
represented schematically (B); a nested two oscillator system is shown (A). The ﬁrst oscillator is the
disynaptic feedback loop between the motor cortex (MC) and the ventral thalamus pars oralis, the basal
ganglia relay nucleus of the thalamus. The second loop consists of the MC to the subthalamic nucleus
(STN), globus pallidus interna (GPi), Vop, and motor cortex once again. Each numbered step (B) shows
subsequent activations, which begin with synchronized activation of the ventral thalamus pars oralis
and GPi neurons in step 1. The activity in Vop is then transmitted to MC, and the activity in GPi
is transmitted to the ventral thalamus pars oralis in step 2. This results in excitation of the MC and
inhibition of the ventral thalamus pars oralis (VL) in step 3. MC activity is then transmitted back to the
ventral thalamus pars oralis coincides with a posthyperpolarization rebound-increased activity in Vop
following GPi axonal inﬂuences on the thalamic neurons in step 4. Excitation from the MC in step 4
combines with the postinhibitory rebound-increased excitability in the ventral thalamus pars oralis to
produce a marked increase in activity, as shown in step 5 (modiﬁed from Montgomery [25]).

210

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 34

One possible explanation is that an action potential generated in the axon of the thalamic neuron
passing in the vicinity of the DBS contact proceeds in an antidromic manner, as demonstrated in
the recording of extracellular action potentials (Figure 7), as well as orthodromically to the cortex.
There, the stimulated motor cortex neurons sent action potentials back to the thalamic neurons.
The timing is such that the action potentials generated in the thalamic neurons consequent to driving
by cortical neurons collided with the antidromic action potentials. This process could be modeled as
the activity traversing one-half of the pathway from the thalamus to the cortex and the entire pathway
from the cortex to the thalamus. Estimating from the latency of the resonant buildup of 5 ms, the total
transit time in the thalamic–cortical feedback loop would be on the order of 6.7 ms. This would
correspond to a frequency within the thalamic–cortical feedback loop of approximately 150 Hz.
These considerations suggest that one possible mechanism for motor improvements with DBS
in the vicinity of both the subthalamic nucleus and the globus pallidus interna may reﬂect resonance
interactions between the oscillator composed of the thalamic-cortical loop and the oscillator in the
manner of DBS. The resonant interactions between the DBS oscillator and the thalamic-cortical
oscillator are thought to improve the signal-to-noise ratio by stochastic resonance, thereby reducing
the misinformation exiting from the motor cortex to the lower motor neurons and restoring the normal
order of motor unit recruitment.
5. Stochastic Resonance
The next question is whether the model described here could account for the improvement in
bradykinesia at other DBS frequencies, as demonstrated in Figure 1. The basal ganglia-thalamic-cortical
system can be considered a network of interconnected polysynaptic re-entrant nonlinear discrete
oscillators (Figure 2). There are a number of different oscillators with differing numbers of nodes; thus,
the DBS at several different frequencies could interact via stochastic resonance with any of the multiple
oscillators. Evidence in support of this hypothesis is given here.
Improvement in motor control can be considered increased information in the effectors, which
is in the orchestration of motor unit recruitments and de-recruitments. Recordings of extracellular
action potentials were obtained as a nonhuman primate preformed an arm-reaching task. Peri-event
rasters and histograms show neuronal activities before and after a behavioral event (Figure 8). As can
be seen, under the condition of no stimulation, there is no change or modulation of the neuronal
activities. However, with DBS-like stimulation in the vicinity of the subthalamic nucleus at 150 pps,
there is a consistent modulation of the neuronal activities with the behavior. The modulation was
less at 100 pps and still less at 50 pps. Again, it is not likely that the information represented by the
modulation of neuronal activities at 150 pps DBS originated in the DBS pulse train (a violation of the
Principle of Informational Synonymy). Rather, modulation was present there, although not observable
over the “noise”. Thus, the signal, being the underlying modulation of neuronal activities, was not
seen above the noise; in other words, there was a poor signal-to-noise ratio. The reverse has been
observed, in which a signal in the neuronal responses with no DBS was progressively lost with higher
DBS frequencies (Figure 9). The DBS at 150 pps affects the signal relative to the noise, but in different
directions and dependent on DBS frequency.
If this model holds for DBS, then the observation that multiple but speciﬁc DBS frequencies
improve hand opening-closing bradykinesia argues for multiple oscillators involved in the hand
opening-closing behavior. Indeed, it is likely that there is an orchestration of motor unit recruitment
and that de-recruitment operates over multiple time scales, each related to an oscillator within the
basal ganglia-thalamic-cortical system [15].

primate. Each dot in the rasters represents a neuronal discharge and each row represents a trial.
Summing a column in the raster produces the histogram. There is no meaningful modulation of
neuronal activity with behavior (appearance of the commencement signal at time zero is indicated
by the up arrow) under the no stimulation condition. However, consistent modulation occurs at
130 pps and, to a lesser extent, at 100 pps DBS, suggesting that the DBS has enlisted the neuron into
being meaningfully related to the behavior. It bears noting that the baseline activity prior to the
commencement signal is reduced [25].

after onset of the commencement signal, indicated by the up arrow. Each dot in the rasters represents
a neuronal discharge and each row represents a trial. Summing a column in the raster produces the
histogram. With no stimulation, with 100 pps DBS, and, to a lesser degree, with 50 pps DBS, there is
an increase in neuronal discharge following the onset of the commencement signal. This dynamic
modulation is lost with the 130-pps DBS [25].

6. Evidence for Oscillations in the Basal Ganglia–Thalamic–Cortical System
The Schuster periodogram [26] is an alternative to a Fourier transform of detecting
periodic (oscillatory) activity in a time series. A variant of the Schuster periodogram has been
demonstrated as mathematically equivalent to the Fourier transform but is easier to implement
(Figure 10) [27]. This method was used to analyze neuronal spike trains from neurons in the basal
ganglia-thalamic-cortical system from two nonhuman primates at rest [28]; an example of the
spectrogram is shown in Figure 11. The color of the pixels in the image represents the z-score difference
from the same spike train where the interspike intervals (ISI) were randomized. A 2-s window of the
spike train was sampled and the z-score change was calculated. The window was then moved over
the entire spike train at 0.2-s steps.

Figure 10. Schematic representation of the Schuster periodogram utilizing circular statistics.
(A) A spike train is divided into segments; (B) each of the two segments is closed to form a circle, and
the time of occurrence of each action potential is plotted as a unit vector on the circumference. As can
be seen, the unit vectors are not distributed randomly over the circumference. A resultant vector is
determined (r1 ), which, in the situation depicted by B, will be nonzero. The magnitude of the resultant
vector indicates the statistical signiﬁcance of the power at the frequency corresponding to the lengths
of the segments. The resultant vectors can be calculated for segments of any size, thus corresponding
to a speciﬁc frequency analogous to the power at any frequency in a Fourier transform. The angle,
θ indicates the phase of the periodic or oscillatory activity.

Figure 11. Spectrogram relative power indicated as a z-score change over the randomized spike train
using a 2-s window moved through time in 0.2-s steps. As can be appreciated, many frequencies
are represented simultaneously in the neuronal spike train. Further, it appears that there are sets of
frequencies that change over time, suggesting bifurcations from metastable states associated with each
set of frequencies [25].

As can be seen, there are multiple and high-frequency oscillatory activities in the neuronal
spike train simultaneously. This multiplicity of frequencies and changes in the sets of frequencies
can be seen in the following: 24 neurons were recorded in the globus pallidus externa, 15 in the
globus pallidus interna, 16 in the putamen, 49 in the sensory cortex, 9 in the subthalamic nucleus,
and 25 in the motor cortex [28]. The average frequency for each structure ranged from 135 to
213

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 34

140 Hz. Mathematical modeling demonstrates that the individual spike trains in loosely coupled
nonlinear oscillators operating at noncommensurate frequencies can entrain multiple frequencies
simultaneously [1,29].
The theory is offered that each oscillator of different frequencies affects different physiological
mechanisms over different time scales, for example, the orchestration of motor unit recruitment and
de-recruitment as described previously. Thus, it would not be unexpected that DBS at different
frequencies would have multiple effects on motor behavior as shown previously in Figure 1.
However, it is not just any frequencies but speciﬁc and precise frequencies, perhaps reﬂecting the
speciﬁc frequencies entrained in the neuronal spike trains of the basal ganglia-thalamic-cortical system.
7. Evidence for DBS-Induced Oscillations
7.1. Direct Observations
Studying the effects of DBS in the vicinity of the subthalamic nucleus in a nonhuman primate
on neuronal action potentials provided an example where DBS could induce oscillations in the basal
ganglia-thalamic-cortical system [28]. An example is shown in the peri-event raster and histogram
of the time interval between DBS pulses for a cortical neuron (Figure 12). As can be seen, there
are three peaks in the post-DBS response with 50 pps DBS. This would correspond to a frequency
of oscillation of 150 Hz. Two peaks are noted in the interval between pulses with stimulation at
100 and 130 pps. Of note, the second peak at 100 pps occurs sooner that at 50 pps and the second
peak is even earlier at 130 pps. These ﬁndings could be explained if the DBS pulses induced an
inherent oscillation of approximately 150 Hz. Thus, the inherent frequency would resonate with DBS
at 50 pps. However, the effect at 100 and 130 pps would be a combination of the response driven
by the DBS pulses at those frequencies and the inherent oscillations phase entrained at 50 pps DBS.
Nonetheless, this observation supports the hypothesis that DBS can induce ongoing oscillations.

Figure 12. (A) A post-stimulus raster and histogram of a cortical neuron recorded in a nonhuman
primate using a 50-pps DBS-like stimulation delivered in the vicinity of the STN. The stimulus pulse
occurred at time 0, and the raster and histogram show the periodic neuronal activities during the
interstimulus pulse intervals. Each dot in the raster represents the onset of an action potential. Each row
represents responses to a single DBS pulse. The number of dots in columns across the raster appears in
the histogram below each raster. The lengths of the raster and histogram represent the time interval
between DBS pulses. In the raster and histogram associated with the 50-pps DBS, a recurring peak of
increased neuronal activity is evident. The truncated appearance of the third peak suggests that the time
period associated with the frequency of the re-entrant oscillatory activity is not an integer multiple of
the time interval between the DBS pulses. This suggests an interaction between the oscillator generating
the recurrent activity and the oscillator composed of the DBS spike train (B). This observation may
be explained by an interaction between a 130-Hz DBS oscillator and a 150-Hz oscillator intrinsic to
the neuron.

7.2. Resonance Effects to Pair-Pulse Stimulation
The basic concept is that if the basal ganglia-thalamic-cortical system represents a closed loop or
feedback system of oscillators, then a single pulse might reverberate in an oscillatory manner through
the loop. If a second pulse is timed precisely to the returning effect from the prior pulse, these effects
should be additive (Figure 13). Thus, an experiment was conducted using pairs of DBS pulses. The ﬁrst
pulse was hypothesized to initiate a re-entrant oscillation, and the second pulse was timed to interact
with the re-entrant activity generated by the ﬁrst pulse. The time interval between the ﬁrst and the
second pulse of the pair corresponds to the cycle time of the oscillator.

Figure 13. (A) A schematic representation of the resonance effect. The ﬁrst stimulation
(conditioning pulse) causes an excitation to traverse the closed loop. If the second stimulation
(test pulse) is delivered just as the excitation effect from the ﬁrst or conditioning pulse returns to
the original site, the temporal summation on the neuronal cell membrane will amplify the response.
(B) Paired-pulse stimulus trains represented schematically. The interstimulus interval represents a
speciﬁc frequency (1/interval). This study examined the frequencies represented by the intervals from
1 to 10 ms (1000 Hz to 100 Hz) at 1-ms increments.

Two nonhuman primates (Macaca mulatta) were trained using only positive reinforcement to sit
quietly in a loosely restraining chair and to allow passive movement of their arms. After training,
a recording chamber was implanted surgically over a craniotomy site such that microelectrodes could
be passed through the intact dura into the basal ganglia as described previously [30]. The protocol
received prior approval by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Cleveland
Clinic Foundation.
A reduced scale model of the human DBS lead (NuMed Inc., 2880 Main St. Hopkinton, NY, USA)
was placed such that the deepest contact was at the bottom of the subthalamic nucleus using stereotactic
methods conﬁrmed by microelectrode recordings of extracellular action potentials. Locations of the
DBS-like leads, as well as other microelectrode recordings, were later conﬁrmed by histological
analyses. The leads had four contacts, each 0.525 mm in diameter, 0.5 mm long, and with a 0.5-mm
space between contacts, giving a total surface area of 0.82 mm2 per contact. Using biphasic square-wave
pulses, constant current electrical stimulations, using biphasic square-wave pulses, were delivered
using the most distal contact (contact No. 0) referenced to the most proximal contact (contact No. 3).
The morphology of the pulses was such that, at contact No. 0, the cathodic phase preceded the
anodic phase. The reverse was true at contact No. 3. A pulse width of 90 μs per phase was used.
The amplitude selected was 80% of the current that produced tonic contraction, presumably from the
current spread to the internal capsule.

215

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 34

Standard methods of microelectrode recordings of neuronal extracellular action potentials were
used. As is standard in electrophysiological studies, autocorrelograms for all neurons were inspected
for the absence of a refractory period as evidenced by a high probability of a neuronal discharge
within 3 ms of the index discharge. Lack of a refractory period would indicate that the waveforms
isolated and attributed to a single neuron were an admixture of two or more neurons. Data from these
neurons were discarded. Also, all pair-wise cross-correlograms for neurons isolated from a single
microelectrode recording site were constructed. Any cross-correlograms showing a refractory period
effect were interpreted as the two neurons actually represented a single neuron that was isolated
incorrectly. If found, data for these pairs of neurons were pooled. Loss of signal related to the effects of
the stimulator artifact was accounted for and corrected.
Continuous recordings of neuronal activity before and during trains of paired-pulse stimuli were
made. Resonance effects were demonstrated by constructing post-stimulus rasters, and histograms
that were indexed to the second of the pulse pair, test pulse. Rasters and histograms were constructed
by taking segments of data immediately after the second or test pulse for 20 ms (Figure 14).
This corresponds to the period between each pair of pulses. Post-stimulus histograms were constructed
where each sequential time bin (0.4 ms) contained counts of neuronal discharge for the 20 ms that
followed the second test pulse. These time bins were then averaged across the number of stimulus
pairs applied, giving a neuronal discharge probability in 0.4-ms time increments following the second
test pulse.

Figure 14. Schematic representation of analysis methods for detecting a resonance effect for
paired-pulse stimulation. A set of virtual stimulus pulse pairs was created during the prestimulation
period by translating the timing of the actual stimulation pulse pairs into the prestimulation period (A).
Post-stimulus rasters and histograms were constructed indexed to the second pulse of the actual (B)
and virtual (C) stimulation pulses. The rasters were collapsed across rows into the time bins (0.4 ms) of
the histograms, resulting in counts of extracellular action potentials. This was normalized by dividing
by the number of sets of paired pulse stimuli, resulting in probabilities of neuronal discharge in each
time interval following the second stimulus pair. The mean probabilities per bin and the standard
deviation were calculated for the virtual stimulation histograms (C). The mean was then subtracted
from each time bin probability during the actual stimulation and divided by the standard deviation,
resulting in a z score (B).

For comparison across different neurons and different structures, these post-stimulus histograms
of neuronal discharge probabilities were normalized by expressing the neuronal discharge counts in
bins as a z score based on the mean and standard deviation of neuronal discharges during the baseline
prior to stimulation. Because of the short interstimulus intervals, it was not possible to compare
216

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 34

neuronal activities following the ﬁrst pulse to activities following the second pulse. Sampling of
the prestimulation period values was determined by creating virtual stimulation pulses so that
neuronal activity during the prestimulation period could be analyzed exactly as the neuronal activity
during the stimulation period (Figure 14). This was chosen as a means to sample the prestimulation
baseline randomly.
Although the interstimulation pulse intervals were not random and therefore the virtual
stimulation train was not random, neuronal activity in the prestimulation period is independent of the
subsequent virtual stimulation pulse train and therefore can be considered random with respect to the
time of neuronal discharge. The mean and standard deviation of the neuronal discharge probability
in the time bins during the prestimulation baseline were calculated as described previously for the
stimulation period. In this case, histograms were indexed to the second virtual pulse. The probability
of neuronal discharge in each time bin in the post-actual stimulus histogram was converted to a z score
by subtracting the mean discharge probability per bin in the post-virtual stimulation histogram and
dividing the difference by the standard deviation of the bin probabilities in the post-virtual stimulation
histogram. This method was chosen over other techniques such as absolute or percent change in
discharge frequency because (1) the z score normalizes data, thus allowing comparisons between
different neurons in different structures; and (2) the z score accounts for the variability of neuronal
discharge activity, thus allowing inferences as to statistical signiﬁcance.
One hundred and eighteen neurons were recorded in the basal ganglia-thalamic-cortical system in
two nonhuman primates (in one nonhuman primate, only 15 neurons studied were in the motor cortex).
Forty neurons were recorded in the motor cortex, 25 in the somatosensory cortex, 16 in the caudate and
putamen, 14 in the globus pallidus internal segment, and 23 in the globus pallidus external segment.
While the number of neurons analyzed within each structure was relatively small, the intent was to
study the dynamics of the basal ganglia-thalamic-cortical system such that consistency of observations
across different nuclei was the primary interest. As such, the number of neurons for the system studied
is similar to other published studies. Analyses within each structure were secondary.
An example of a response in a motor cortex neuron is shown in Figure 15. Each colored bar
represents a change in the probability of a neuronal discharge after the second or test pulse compared
to the prestimulation baseline associated with a z score equal to or greater than 1.96. As can be seen,
the signiﬁcant resonance effects for longer interstimulus intervals had different latencies than the
response to the interstimulus interval of 1 ms. Consequently, it is not likely that these other responses
were mediated by the same mechanism or that they represent a direct response to the second pulse.
Figure 15 also shows that this neuron had multiple resonance effects at longer latencies that were
associated with 4-, 5-, 7-, and 8-ms interstimulus intervals, corresponding to a resonance frequency of
250, 200, 143, and 125 Hz, respectively. Interestingly, such high-frequency oscillations also have been
noted in local ﬁeld potential recordings in the subthalamic nucleus of patients with Parkinson’s disease
through implanted DBS leads [31]. However, inferences from local ﬁeld potentials are problematic
given that these represent the summed activities of a large number of dendrites, some of which may
be irrelevant yet interact to affect the local ﬁeld potential in any event.
Results shown in Figure 15 suggest evidence of a periodic excitability arising within the single
neuron. The ﬁrst response with the 1-ms interstimulus interval pulses occurs 3.8 ms after the test
pulse, suggesting that this was not a direct antidromic effect, but probably that the neuron being
analyzed was at least one synapse from the neuron being stimulated. Interestingly, after the 1-ms
interstimulus interval test pulse, the neuronal discharge probability increased signiﬁcantly at 7.6 and
15.2 ms during the 20 ms after the test pulse; these probably are harmonics of the initial latency of
3.8 ms. Analyses were conducted on 118 neurons, all of which showed at least one resonance effect
with paired-pulse stimulation at different interstimulus intervals. The median number of signiﬁcant
resonance frequencies (25th to 75th percentile; number of neurons) in the pooled caudate and putamen
was ﬁve (2 to 7.5, n = 16); globus pallidus externa, 9 (5.5 to 11.75, n = 23); globus pallidus interna,
6 (1 to 9, n = 14); somatosensory cortex, 7 (3.5 to 8.5, n = 25); and motor cortex, 7 (4.5 to 12, n = 40).
Thus, most neurons had multiple resonance effects at different frequencies.

8. Evidence of DBS Oscillatory Interactions with Intrinsic Oscillators within the Basal
Ganglia-Thalamic-Cortical System
Recent studies demonstrate antidromic action potentials in the subthalamic nucleus neuronal in
response to DBS in the vicinity of the contralateral STN [32]. Interestingly, only a small percentage of
DBS pulses resulted in antidromic action potentials. This result is consistent with other studies [32–36].
One wonders whether this result indicates a purely stochastic process or some underlying determining
mechanism such as the speciﬁc dynamics in the neuronal membrane potentials in the soma.
STN neuronal microelectrode recordings were used in subjects with Parkinson’s disease made during
DBS in the vicinity of the contralateral STN in a manner described elsewhere [32]. Stimulation was at
160 and 30 pps. Fifty-eight neurons were recorded from eight STNs in eight subjects.
Spike trains containing only antidromic action potentials (antidromic-only spike trains)
were constructed from the original spike trains by retaining only those time stamps of
antidromic action potentials. Fifty-two of the 58 neurons demonstrated antidromic action potentials.
Randomized antidromic-only spike trains were created by shufﬂing the order of the antidromic action
potentials in the antidromic-only spike trains. This was accomplished by dividing the antidromic-only
spike trains into segments between successive stimulation pulses. Each interstimulus pulse interval
may or may not have an antidromic action potential.
The hypothesis to be addressed is that sequence of antidromic action potentials are not random.
Thus, it is necessary to compare the actual sequence of antidromic action potentials to what would
be a random sequence. The orders of the consecutive interstimulus pulse intervals were randomized
(shufﬂed) in order to affect a breaking up of any periodicity in intervals containing an antidromic
action potential, creating a randomized antidromic-only spike train. If the probability of an antidromic
action potential is not random, the interspike interval histogram of the randomized antidromic-only
spike train would differ from the ISI of the corresponding antidromic-only spike train.
Periodicity in the antidromic-only spike train was examined by comparing the antidromic-only
spike train to the randomized antidromic-only spike train using power spectral densities (PSDs).
It is important to note that the antidromic action potentials are time-locked to the stimulation
pulse. The frequencies of the antidromic action potentials thus stand in complex relation to the
DBS frequencies.
Figures 16 and 17 show representative antidromic-only spike trains and randomized antidromic-only
spike train ISI histograms for two neurons for DBS at 160 and 30 pps, respectively. As can be seen,
an antidromic action potential occurs only after a stimulation pulse. The time resolution is thus the
interstimulus pulse interval. Importantly, the varying magnitude of the peaks suggests that different
probabilities of an antidromic action potential follow different stimulation pulses. Such would not
be the case, however, if every stimulation pulse was associated with an antidromic action potential
or if the probability of an antidromic action potential was random relative to the stimulation pulses.
218

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 34

Rather, there appears to be “structure” in the probabilities of an antidromic action potential. This is
further supported by the lack of peaks at such times when the sequential order of the antidromic
action potentials is randomized. Of the 52 neurons demonstrating antidromic action potentials studied,
24 showed a signiﬁcant difference between the antidromic-only spike train and the randomized
antidromic spike train ISI. These latter neurons received additional study.

randomized-only spike train counterpart for 160 pps DBS.

Figure 17. Representative interspike interval histogram of a antidromic-only spike train and its
randomized-only spike train counterpart for 30 pps DBS.

Power spectral densities (PSDs) were constructed on antidromic spike trains from antidromic-only
spike train and randomized antidromic-only spike train data. Figure 18 shows a representative example.
A strong peak appears at 66 Hz, a lesser peak at 26 Hz, and a small peak appears at 92 Hz in the
antidromic-only spike trains. This latter peak is not present in the randomized antidromic-only spike
train. The clear distinction in these peaks from the rest of the frequencies in the PSD attests to their
signiﬁcance. Figure 19 shows the PSD for the same neuron that appears in Figure 6 but does not appear
under the 30-pps DBS condition. Peaks are observed at 30 Hz (DBS frequency), 26 Hz, 22 Hz, 6 Hz,
219

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 34

and 3 Hz. Original spike trains demonstrated no peaks in the PSD of neuronal activity during the
baseline before DBS; a representative example is shown in Figure 20.

The various peaks are listed in Table 1. Oscillations at 66 and 26 Hz occurred independently of
other frequencies, which suggests that these oscillators are fundamental to the subthalamic nucleus.
In addition, the 26-Hz oscillations were seen at both 160 and 30 pps DBS. These are not a consequence
of the stimulation frequency. They likely represent, rather, a fundamental oscillator involving the
subthalamic nucleus. Also, the peaks at 26 and 66 Hz are not harmonics of the DBS frequencies.
Interestingly, several neurons had both 66- and 26-Hz oscillators. Other peaks probably represent beat
frequencies that result from the interaction of the fundamental frequencies and the DBS frequency.
For example, peaks detected at 92 Hz probably are the result of interactions between the 66-Hz
fundamental oscillator and the 160-pps DBS (the actual stimulation frequency was measured at
157.5 pps). As can be seen, the 92-Hz peak was never present without the peak at 66 Hz. Similarly,
the 3-Hz peak likely represents the beat frequency from the interaction of the fundamental 26-Hz
frequency and the 30-pps DBS, as the 3-Hz peak was never seen at the 160-pps DBS and was never
independent of the 26-Hz peak under the 30-pps DBS. By virtue of the fact that the 30-pps DBS is closer
to the fundamental frequency at 26 Hz than the 160-pps DBS, which would produce high-frequency
harmonics and beat interactions, other peaks under the 30-pps DBS likely represent beat interactions
among harmonics of the DBS and the fundamental frequencies.

The relatively few neurons available for analyses mean that any conclusions are tentative,
and the difﬁculty of these experiments makes it unlikely that signiﬁcantly more data are forthcoming.
221

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 34

As one awaits future conﬁrmation or refutation, these remarkable ﬁndings—their implications in
particular—warrant reporting, albeit with the appropriate caveats kept in mind.
The study led to the following conclusions: For many neurons, occurrence of an antidromic action
potential is not random. The probability of an antidromic action potential reﬂects the underlying
state of the neuronal excitability, which means that the antidromic action potential can be used as
a probe of the underlying neuronal dynamics. The probability of an antidromic action potential and the
underlying neuronal state of excitability appear periodic or oscillatory. Not simple harmonics of the
DBS frequency, the frequencies of the underlying oscillatory neuronal states are, rather, independent of
the latter. One cannot exclude the possibility that the actual frequency of these oscillators is not some
integer multiple of the 26- or 66-Hz oscillators. The beat frequencies of 3 and 92 Hz for some of the
neurons suggest that 26 and 66 Hz are the fundamental frequencies for the involved oscillators. The key
ﬁnding for the purpose of this article is that DBS can be considered a discrete nonlinear oscillator,
which interacts with independent oscillators within the subthalamic nucleus, possibly arising from
oscillators intrinsic to the basal ganglia-thalamic-cortical system.
9. Computational Simulations of the Basal Ganglia-Thalamic-Cortical System as a Network of
Loosely Coupled, Nonlinear Re-Entrant Discrete Oscillators
As a proof of concept, although not of biological fact, computational simulations were conducted
using an architecture derived from the theory that the basal ganglia-thalamic-cortical system is
organized as large, loosely coupled, nonlinear polysynaptic discrete re-entrant oscillators (Figure 21),
details of which are discussed elsewhere [1,16]. A detailed description of discrete neural oscillators can
be found in Montgomery [1]. Brieﬂy, a node is deﬁned as a collection of local neurons that generally
share the same inputs and project to same neurons in another node. For example, a node may be
conﬁned to a single anatomical structure and each anatomical nucleus (and region of cortex) consists
of a number of nodes. An oscillator consists of a set of nodes whose neurons are connected with
previous and subsequent nodes of neurons. During any cycle of reentrant activities within the oscillator,
a subset of neurons within each node may discharge sufﬁcient to maintain the oscillations yet not
leading to saturation or collapse of the oscillator. The simulations are designed to determine whether
neural oscillators of the general architecture shown in Figure 21 are capable of sustained oscillatory
activities, what would be the nature of those activities and what if any similarity of the oscillations in
the simulation to analyses of neuronal activities recorded in human and non-human primates.

Figure 21. Schematic representation of the basic architecture of the computer simulations.
Represented is one oscillator to show the structure of neurons within each node and how information
is transmitted via subsets of neurons within each node. A four-node oscillator (nodes 1–4) whose
nodes contain ﬁve neurons each is illustrated. A series of time intervals (A–H) are represented.
Neurons become active in node 1 at time A. The activity then propagates to neurons in subsequent
nodes. For any part of the cycle, a subset of neurons in each node becomes active and the speciﬁc
neurons that are active vary with each cycle. Thus the neurons active at time B in node 2 are different
than the neurons active in node 2 at time F. Multiple oscillators of different numbers of nodes,
thus different inherent fundamental frequencies, can be linked [1].

222

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 34

The operations of neurons in the simulation are depicted in Figure 22. Each neuron is of the
integrate-and-ﬁre type. Postsynaptic potentials resulting from synaptic inputs are modeled as decaying
exponential functions. The output is a discrete pulse representing an action potential based on the
summed synaptic inputs exceeding a threshold. The threshold is dynamic so as to account for
changes in ionic conductances with subthreshold changes in the neuronal membrane potential,
for example, depolarization blockade (elevated threshold) and post-hyperpolarization rebound
(decreased threshold). A probability function determines whether an action potential arriving at
the presynaptic terminal induces a postsynaptic potential change and reﬂects the known inefﬁciency
of synaptic transmission. Conduction times and synaptic delays were established based on studies
described previously.

Figure 22. Model neurons consist of multiple dendritic inputs affecting the postsynaptic
transmembrane electrical potentials. These inputs are summed at the action potential-initiating segment.
If the summed potentials exceed a dynamic threshold, an action potential is generated. The postsynaptic
potentials are modeled on as either a depolarizing or a hyperpolarizing decaying exponential function.
The threshold, for example, at time ti , varies with the previous transmembrane electrical potential
just prior at time ti-1 . This allows changes in Na+ voltage-gated ionic conductance channel activation
and inactivation. In this manner, post-hyperpolarization excitation and depolarization blockade are
modeled [1].

One instantiation of the computational modeling is shown in Figure 23. There are three
interconnected oscillators with different numbers of nodes and thus different inherent fundamental
frequencies. The inherent frequency is deﬁned as number of times a “bit of information”, such as
an action potential, can traverse the oscillator in one second and depends on the number of nodes
within the oscillator. A spectrogram showing the frequency contents over time for a representative
neuron in the computational network is shown in Figure 24, along with spectrograms obtained from
a globus pallidus externa of a nonhuman primate and from a neuron recorded in the subthalamic
nucleus of a human with Parkinson’s disease. As can be seen, the outputs are very similar and consist
of multiple frequencies entrained simultaneously, sets of frequencies that are stable over brief periods
of time between bifurcations.

223

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 34

Figure 23. One instantiation of the four-oscillator network. There are three oscillators that consist of
four, ﬁve, and six nodes, respectively. Each node contains 100 neurons. In each oscillator, a designative
node is also connected to the corresponding node in the other oscillators, creating a loosely coupled
network. The neurons in each node received inputs from all neurons in the previous node and sent
outputs to each neuron in the subsequent node [1].

Figure 24. Spectrograms showing the amount of activity (power) at different frequencies over time.
The power is represented as the z-score difference (color scale) over a randomized train of action
potentials (spike train). At each point in time, the train of action potentials has a speciﬁc set of
frequencies over a range of frequencies. Also, the train of action potentials appears to be stable in their
frequency content and then change (bifurcate) to other sets of frequencies. Spectrograms of actual
recordings in the globus pallidus externa of a nonhuman primate, the subthalamic nucleus in a human,
and a neuron in the computer model of the network are shown.

10. Conclusions
The physiological mechanism underlying the effect of DBS frequency remains an enigma,
particularly as the complexities of the relationship between the DBS frequencies and motor effects
are more fully recognized. However, addressing the enigma is a great opportunity because,
typically, new knowledge is needed in order to solve it. New knowledge can only come from new
hypotheses, which most often require new perspectives. New perspectives require letting go of old

224

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 34

perspectives, at least those aspects that are counterproductive. This requires exercise in epistemological
analysis as well as experiments.
It is likely that the effects of DBS frequency have a great deal to say about the underlying
dynamics of the pathophysiology and physiology of the basal ganglia-thalamic-cortical system.
A better understanding of those dynamics could provide a metaphor for research that extends beyond
the basal ganglia-thalamic-cortical system.

Abstract: During the last 25 years, more than 100,000 patients have been treated with Deep Brain
Stimulation (DBS). While human clinical and animal preclinical research has shed light on the complex
brain-signaling disturbances that underpin e.g., Parkinson’s disease (PD), less information is available
when it comes to complex psychosocial changes following DBS interventions. In this contribution, we
propose to more thoroughly investigate complex personality-related changes following deep brain
stimulation through reﬁned and reliable instruments in order to help patients and their relatives in the
post-surgery phase. By pursuing this goal, we ﬁrst outline the clinical importance DBS has attained
followed by discussing problematic and undesired non-motor problems that accompany some DBS
interventions. After providing a brief deﬁnition of complex changes, we move on by outlining the
measurement problem complex changes relating to non-motor symptoms currently are associated
with. The latter circumstance substantiates the need for reﬁned instruments that are able to validly
assess personality-related changes. After providing a brief paragraph with regard to conceptions
of personality, we argue that the latter is signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by certain competencies which
themselves currently play only a tangential role in the clinical DBS-discourse. Increasing awareness
of the latter circumstance is crucial in the context of DBS because it could illuminate a link between
competencies and the emergence of personality-related changes, such as new-onset impulse control
disorders that have relevance for patients and their relatives. Finally, we elaborate on the ﬁeld of
application of instruments that are able to measure personality-related changes.
Keywords: deep brain stimulation; personality; instruments; competencies

1. Introduction
Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a neurosurgical intervention that involves electrode implantation to
apply electrical currents to target structures aiming at alleviating symptoms. More precisely, the surgical
method involves a stereotactical implantation of usually quadripolar electrodes including an extracerebral
“pacemaker” that modulates the activity of selected regions in the brain with electric impulses. The key
advantages of this procedure are (1) its potential reversibility and (2) the possibility to postoperatively
optimize treatment effects via an external programming device. So far, a great number of patients suffering
from various neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders have been treated with DBS. DBS unquestionably
is a remarkable therapy that has provided hope for many patients and that has been shown to be more
effective than best medical treatment for some disorders. Among those, patients suffering from Parkinson’s
disease (PD) and who are refractory to drug treatment represent by far the largest patient group.

In the meantime, the rapid development reached a non-undisputed broadening of the therapeutic
spectrum [1]. DBS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has been established in randomized, controlled trials as
an effective therapy for the motor symptoms of PD [2–4] and, consequently, the‘number of patients being
treated by DBS has steadily increased. Along this increase, challenges arose with regard to appropriate patient
selection and side-effects, to name a few. With some delay, the systematic investigation of neuropsychiatric
changes observed in patients treated with DBS for movement disorders found their way into the scientific
literature, first as anecdotal reports and later in the form of quantitative research studies [5].
In sum, DBS has demonstrated dramatic symptom relief for a multitude of patients.
However, complex non-motor changes following DBS interventions have been described. Because there
is only a very limited number of instruments that are able to validly measure complex personality-related
changes, there is great need for the development of new and reliable instruments in order to collect
information and to evaluate these changes. As will be seen, there is a need to more thoroughly explore
e.g., morally relevant behaviours (such as impulse control disorders, ICDs) with a particular emphasis
on psychosocial competencies. The underlying competencies that might be dysfunctional secondary to
disease, pharmacological therapy or neuromodulation interventions aiming to treat patients suffering
from diseases, however, are hardly the focus of current DBS-research. In turn, new instruments that are
able to quantify and depict such competencies might be highly relevant because they can yield explanatory
power regarding psychosocial changes that are decisive for patients and their relatives.
2. Complex Changes after DBS Interventions
2.1. Non-Motor Problems Following DBS in Movement Disorders
In what will follow and for the sake of clarity, we restrict the argumentation of this
contribution to the context of movement disorders and especially PD, even though we are aware
of the fact that strictly speaking, PD has a well-documented neuropsychiatric impact on patients.
Because STN-DBS in PD is, apart from stimulation of the globus pallidus internus (GPi), most frequently
performed, the argumentation below takes up studies that investigated basal-ganglia dysfunction.
Furthermore, a recent study provides Class II evidence that STN DBS offers more off-phase motor
improvement than GPi DBS with similar risk for behavioural, affective and cognitive complications [6].
Whilst DBS aims primarily at improving motor symptoms in PD, accumulating knowledge points
toward non-motor complications. Because a large number of fibers converge in the basal ganglia nuclei
on a very small area, it is not surprising that targeting specific functions and manipulating them in
an isolated fashion is tremendously difficult. In fact, intervening into basal ganglia physiology bears
the risk of modulating non-motor functions [7–9]. The difficulty of specific targeting is even greater
when factoring in recent notions of re-entrant or interconnected cortico-striato-pallido-thalamo-cortical
loops representing different frequencies [10]. In fact, by manipulating a specific node in the network,
one might influence as many different functions, depending on the degree of shared functionality with
other circuits. Hence, DBS intervenes with a very complex network [11], the shear complexity of which
has probably only started to be deciphered.
A large body of evidence implicates the role of the basal ganglia (BG) in the processing of
non-motor signals and several psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive
disorder (OCD), phobias and panic attacks, depressive states, addiction and eating disorders [12–14].
Similarly, neuropsychological changes in humans following DBS interventions have been observed [15],
denoting the characterization of the BG as centers of convergence encoding motor, cognitive, associative
and affective processes. Notably, the STN, one of the most commonly targeted structures for DBS
in PD, has a strategic position due to its connections to both BG output structures (the GPi and
substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr)). Unsurprisingly, modulation of STN-signaling has therefore
demonstrated to result in impulsive responding and dysfunctional inhibitory control, such as
perseveration, obsessions and compulsions [16]. Hence, it is very well possible that interference with
basal ganglia nuclei and the STN speciﬁcally, by disease or interventions, can modulate associative

228

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 40

and limbic processing. Notably, interventions not only include DBS but also e.g., pharmacological
treatment. The latter has demonstrated the potential of causing unintended side-effects either in
combination with DBS or by itself e.g., when drugs are reduced too promptly after DBS initiation
or in case of dopamine agonists [17]. In addition, the dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome
(DAWS) and dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS) leading to neuropsychiatric symptoms and
decreased self-control, respectively, have been described in PD. Therefore, it is widely appreciated that
pathological processes and pharmacological treatment alike can lead to alterations in the processing of
emotional, cognitive and behavioural stimuli [18].
More generally, a number of behavioural and affective sequelae, such as hypomania, new onset
impulse control disorders (ICDs including hypersexuality, pathological buying, pathological gambling,
and addiction to levodopa), logorrhea, irritability, impatience and aggression, distractibility and
attention problems, egocentrism, obstinacy, and lying have been described following DBS treatment in
humans [15,16,19,20]. In the meanwhile, there is also evidence for changes that can be evaluated positively
such as increased emotional wellbeing that results in increased Quality of Life (QoL) (see Section 2.2).
Undisputedly, complex non-motor changes have been described following DBS. In this
contribution, we extend the topic of non-motor problems and deliberate on complex, non-motor
changes for which the evaluation is unclear (i.e., such changes are not per se problematic and can
even be positively evaluated). Patients who experience substantial symptom relief may develop new
interests and behave differently. While the evaluation of whether these changes are problematic
is important, we may ﬁrst have to make sure that complex changes can reliably be measured.
This includes the possibility that strictly differentiating between the measurement and evaluation
process is eventually not possible, in particular when measuring personality changes where a positive
or negative evaluation could be intrinsic to the measurement process. Nevertheless, and as will be seen,
sensitive instruments are highly needed. First, however, we will investigate the nature of complex
changes and the fundamental problem they are associated with.
2.2. Complex Changes: In Search of Reliable Instruments
Complex changes can be described as side-effects characterized by two gradual,
qualitatively described dimensions. They include measurement complexity of side-effect on the
one side and relative life impact of the side-effect weighted by its incidence in the natural disease
history on the other side (see [20], Figure 2, for detailed information). Hence, complex changes represent
side-effects that are associated with a high level of measurement complexity—an indirect evidence
for it being an above average variance of the documented prevalence of a specific side-effect—and a
correspondingly high level of relative life impact for the patient but also his/her social surrounding.
Unfortunately, our own research provides evidence that the third-person perspective is almost never
assessed in current practice (the usage of test scores that emerge from persons affiliated with the
patient, are basically nonexistent [21], with the exception of some few recent studies (e.g., [22,23]).
Paradigmatic examples of complex changes include changes in personality and moral behaviour.
Because there is the problem of measurement complexity, predicting side-effects relating to psychosocial
functioning of the patient is currently difficult. Despite the fact that patients raise their concern over
the propensity of DBS to cause personality-related changes and that cases in which sudden alterations
of personality after DBS have been described (see next paragraph), less emphasis has been put on the
construction of instruments for quantifying personality-related changes. It thus stands to reason that
complex changes in general (i.e., not limited to stimulation-induced changes) are generally underreported
and hence affect the patient population to a much greater extent than assumed. The relative life-impact,
in the meanwhile, depends on not only the type of side-effect but also on factors such as, among others,
the pre-operative psychosocial status of the individual and premorbid personality traits.
As listed above, non-motor problems following DBS interventions—factors that clearly constrain
the effectiveness of this type of intervention—often comprise a neuropsychiatric dimension.
While some studies investigated non-motor problems following DBS interventions, few if any
have focused on more demanding notions of personality and psychosocial competency [15],
229

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 40

probably because of the complexity of the subject matter. For example, STN-DBS has been associated
with deﬁcits on a variety of tasks that require inhibition of prepotent responses and response selection
during situations of high conﬂict (for a review, see [16]; for augmented impulsivity, see [24–26];
for a study demonstrating increased impulsivity assessed by the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS),
see [27]), but few investigations included more profound notions of personality (see next paragraph).
With regard to changes in mood and behaviour, a meta-analysis involving 1398 patients and 82 studies
by Temel et al. [28] outlined that 8% suffer from depression, while activities of daily living (ADL) score
improved by 52%, consistent with other reports documenting an improvement in QoL that is only
related to physical aspects but not to mood ([29]: prospective study with non-implanted PD patients as
control group). The latter study also highlighted 9% psychiatric complications (compared to 3% in the
control group). Another more recent study found few changes in mood and behaviour with unilateral
STN or GPi DBS, relating to worsened anxiety, depression and mania [30]. Other studies also revealed
an increase in QoL including emotional well-being (for improvements of anxiety and depression
see [31–33], in case of stigma and bodily discomfort see [34,35]). Particularly, the study of Witt and
colleagues [19] found an improvement in anxiety, otherwise psychiatric adverse events in 16.7% of
patients (compared to 12.7% for best medical treatment group) and a decrease in frontal cognitive
functioning with no consequences on improvements in QoL. Finally, alterations in decision-making of
PD patients measured by the Iowa gambling task (IGT) have been demonstrated by Pagonabarraga
and colleagues [36] (with results pointing at similar decision-making deﬁcits as seen in ventromedial
prefrontal cortex (PFC) lesioned patients and pathological gamblers). Even though incorporating
only a small sample size, Bentrup et al. [37] found an increase in “novelty seeking” in two out of 15
patients besides a decrease of sociomoral judgment on the six-level Kohlberg scale. On the contrary,
Brandt et al. found that DBS may temper the tendency of risk-taking on risky decision making tasks
with DBS patients being more risk-averse in ambiguous-risk situations [38].
With regard to personality changes mirroring temperament and character, Houeto and
colleagues [39] have examined, in an earlier study and retrospectively, adjustment disorders
(using the social adjustment scale (SAS)), personality changes (using the Iowa rating scale of
personality change (IRSPC)) and psychiatric disorders (using psychiatric interviews and the mini
international neuropsychiatric inventory). Results indicated moderately to severely impaired social
adjustment by 62.5% while personality traits were improved by 35% and aggravated by another
35%. Table 1 lists these and the forthcoming outcomes of some recently performed DBS-studies
together with a brief test description, overall revealing that more studies and new instruments would
be desirable. Another retrospective study of the same researchers [34], however, observed very
different results including unmodiﬁed personality traits (as assessed by the Temperament and
Character Inventory-revised (TCI-R) and this contrary to [40], who found increased scores on
two Novelty-Seeking subscales of the same measure) and social adjustment apart from improved
depression, anxiety and QoL. Denheyer and colleagues [41], on the other hand, used the Frontal
Systems Behavior Scale (FrSBE) in order to assess behavioural changes including apathy, disinhibition
and executive dysfunction. In a retrospective study with a non-representative sample, all scores
increased signiﬁcantly. Notably, most of the above-listed instruments have important limitations,
such as, for example, the subjective nature of the FrSBE that is inﬂuenced by e.g., preconceived
expectations about the outcome of DBS. Taken together, these outcomes imply relatively contradictory
results. To be clear, psychosocial dysfunction and changes relating to altered character after
DBS, potentially resulting in difﬁculties of social adjustment, satisfaction gaps and conﬂicting
outcome interpretations between patients, their relatives and practitioners, have vaguely been
described ([42,43], or studies using e.g., the SAS), but have not been investigated focusing
on causal elements leading to such changes. Because few empirical studies that investigate
personality changes exist, recently Lewis and colleagues [22] have examined the latter by use of
semi-structured interviews and a neuropsychiatric battery (Parkinson’s disease questionnaire-PDQ-39,
Beck depression inventory (BDI-II), apathy evaluation scale (AES), state-trait anxiety inventory

230

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 40

(STAI-state), self-report manic inventory (SRMI), Barratt impulsiveness scale (BIS-11), hypomanic
personality scale (HPS) and mini mental status examination (MMSE)), highlighting that personality
changes occur between 22% (self-evaluation) and 44% (evaluation by caregiver, e.g., spouses), with
another 57% perceiving mood changes as positively, thereby emphasizing the relevance of such
investigations. However, higher apathy and anxiety levels were found in the negative change
group. The fact that the used standard measurement scales were unsuccessful in adequately reﬂecting
personality and mood changes in this study, substantiates the need for better and reﬁned instruments.
One more recent study investigated personality changes after DBS [23]: the 125-item version of the TCI
(TCI-125), the urgency-premeditation-perseverance-sensation seeking (UPPS) impulsive behaviour
scale and the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ) have been used with ﬁndings relating to
increased impulsivity and personality changes in Persistence- and Self-Transcendence test scores
(see Table 1). Notably, the previously listed non-motor problems are likely to be associated with
other ﬁne-grained changes which may reach far into the domain of personal convictions, values and
sensitivities. These changes might be so nuanced that they will slip through current assessment of
psychiatric test batteries (for example, see [22]). Hence, even though there are a number of tests
for investigating e.g., impulsivity (e.g., Eriksen ﬂanker and Simon task, the Stroop color word
interference task and random number generation; [16]), less emphasis has been put on the construction
of instruments for quantifying nuanced personality-related changes [5,44], including instruments
depicting personal competencies in sociomoral information processing in order to have instruments at
one’s disposal that pick up relevant topics that matter to patients and caregivers.
Addressing complex personality-related changes with the requisite rigour may explain causal
elements for the emergence of conﬂicting outcome interpretations and social maladjustment that are
relevant for patients and their relatives. Clearly, such instruments need to rely on newer insights of
psychological research (see Section 4.2). While in the large majority of patients, symptoms relating to
dominant expressions of behavioural phenotypes such as impulse control disorders or hypomania can
be controlled (either they vanish spontaneously or by adjusting stimulation and/or drug treatment),
more subtle changes have rarely been addressed so far due to the lack of sensitive instruments that
measure complex changes beyond standard test-psychology. Given that some behavioural changes
listed above had long-lasting social effects and damaged relationships that often only came to the
fore through in-depth qualitative research [45], and given that patients express their concern over
personality-related changes secondary to deep brain stimulation—as clinical experience at our clinic
shows—together with the magnitude of the life impact for patients and their relatives, it is staggering
that, if any, only a very limited set of data e.g., [22,23,46] and few established instruments apart from
very general personality assessment tools of standard test psychology (e.g., the big ﬁve personality
test, but see Table 1) are currently available that deal with the topic of personality-related changes.
The limited data is surprising also when considering that changes in personality and mood under
DBS in PD are discussed both in the clinical but also the ethical literature [47–50]. In addition to the
problem of measuring complex changes, there is also the evaluation difﬁculty relating to the problem
of how to evaluate such changes. As Kraemer [51] pointed out, “alienation from alienating conditions”
can occur. The latter denotes the difﬁculty of how to evaluate changes in personality. Are marital
problems following DBS implantations categorically social maladjustments or may they, in a proportion
of patients, reﬂect a changed personality denoting to more fundamental desires and thoughts that
are at the core of the patients’ true self? Does a given change in personality symbolize alienation
or approach to a patient’s pre-morbid personality? Without going into the details of such difﬁcult
questions, it is enough to stress that instruments and their ability to measure complex changes are a
necessary precondition in order to move on and evaluate whether complex changes are problematic
(including e.g., notions of felt-authenticity and felt-alienation). This includes the very possibility that
not all changes are per se negative and that also positive personality changes following DBS surgery
can occur. The latter is particularly important in the context of psychiatric DBS intervention where the
positive change of ones’ personality is at the core of the therapeutic aim. These strategies may inform
ethically responsible decision making in e.g., the referral practice of DBS interventions (see Section 4.3).

In sum, we argue that there is currently a lack of valid instruments that adequately depict changes
in psychosocial processing. Even though a limited number of standardized questionnaires and tests
are available, they may not reﬂect sufﬁciently the behavioural and affective changes and their effects
in real life. Therefore, new avenues for the better description of complex personality-related changes
that may explain causal elements for the emergence of conﬂicting outcome interpretations, in addition
to social maladjustment that are relevant for patients and their relatives, need to involve instruments
that rely on newer insights of psychological research.
3. Psychosocial Competencies
3.1. Individual Identity, Personality and Psychosocial Competencies: Conceptualizations and Interconnections
As proposed elsewhere [5], a conceptual clariﬁcation of individual identity and personality is
decisive for evaluating and measuring potential personality-related changes in the future. Even though
the focus of this contribution is empirical rather than conceptual, a brief conceptual clariﬁcation is
necessary. While “individual identity” may be understood as a philosophical concept, “personality”
refers to a psychological one [5]. Because the latter is empirical in nature, it is part of this work.
Personality can brieﬂy be described as the combination of certain characteristics or qualities that
form an individual’s idiosyncratic character. It is commonly deﬁned as “the organized set of
characteristics possessed by a person that uniquely inﬂuences his or her cognitions, motivations,
and behaviours in various situations” [52]. Psychosocial competencies are one class of examples
that can inﬂuence and guide a person’s cognition, motivation and behaviour and hence align with
the previous deﬁnition of personality. They include, among others, self-regulatory skills, the ability
to identify issues linked to personal desires and values and to align one’s behaviour according
to one’s self-conception, the desire to orient oneself towards and strive for one’s ideals, skills to
resolve conﬂicting (internal or external) tendencies and the ability to act consistently with one’s
internal thoughts and ideas. They furthermore guide human cognition through schemas and scripts
(i.e., cognitive representations, e.g., [53,54]). Personality changes as understood in current psychology
refer to alterations in the “Big Five” personality traits (i.e., extraversion, neuroticism, agreeableness,
conscientiousness, openness to experience; see [55]), representing a very vague sum of a set of traits
that can be altered. Notably, the latter concept has recently been expanded by the HEXACO model
that adds a sixth trait circumscribing ones’ personality. That this sixth personality trait is precisely
moral in nature (honesty-humility-dimension) is certainly an interesting development that aligns with
the requested emphasis on morality and its associated competencies expressed in this contribution
(see Section 4.1).
While a whole plethora of different competencies are necessary and amalgamate in interpersonal
human conduct, the time is rife for investigating basic mechanisms of psychosocial competencies and to
start developing instruments for measuring the underlying competencies. The fact that psychological
competencies are needed in situations of complex decision making and behaviour, together with
the likely potential of DBS to inﬂuence such competencies, corroborates the need of instruments to
document and evaluate changes of psychosocial functioning in order to better support patients and
their social surrounding. Moreover, DBS provides a possibility to investigate changes depending on
type of stimulation and anatomical target.
3.2. Human Behaviour as an Expression of Social Competencies
With the emergence of psychology as a scientiﬁc discipline, questions arose regarding the
identiﬁcation of psychological skills that are necessary for social interaction but also regarding the
extent and interplay of biological determinants that affect psychological processes. Broadly speaking,
human behaviour includes processing external and internal stimuli and interacting with the external
world. Hence, an interactionist view is mandatory in order to explain and understand behaviour.

233

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 40

The same holds with regard to moral behaviour where analogously personal and environmental
or contextual factors operate interactively in determining behaviour. Personal factors include a
speciﬁc set of competencies while environmental factors involve conditions promoting or obscuring
moral conduct (e.g., through priming by family pictures, time pressure, economic incentives, [56–59]).
In addition, moral behaviour involves a normative reference frame to which the subject has at
least partial access [60]. Thus, apart from environmental factors as well as ones’ personal moral
identity, personal competencies signiﬁcantly inﬂuence human action. Because it is likely that disorders
and treatment approaches when interfering with the central nervous systems integrity directly or
indirectly alike, might inﬂuence psychosocial competencies, the investigation of abilities of patients
is genuinely pertinent. In line with this, it might be possible that DBS detrimentally inﬂuences a
speciﬁc subset of competencies in a way that facilitates the emergence of behavioural disorders,
such as ICDs, consequently leading to complex changes including e.g., psychosocial maladjustment.
Unfortunately, the potentially dysfunctional competencies secondary to DBS interventions are hardly
the focus of current research. So far, socio-moral behaviour and moral information processing
following deep brain stimulation interventions has received little attention, even though problems in
social adjustment raise questions that refer to psychosocial competences and abilities of the patient.
New instruments that are able to quantify and depict such competencies might be highly relevant
because they can yield explanatory power regarding psychosocial changes that are decisive for patients
and their relatives.
4. Moral Psychological Competencies, Requirements for Instrument Implementation Strategies
and Future Use of Instruments in DBS Research and Therapy
4.1. Moral Psychological Relevance for Assessing Complex Changes in Moral Information Processing as an
Exemplary Case
The ﬁeld with the richest empirical knowledge on how agents reason, decide and act morally
is still moral psychology. Undisputedly, moral behaviour in everyday situations reposes critically
on speciﬁc skills moral agents imperatively have to be equipped with. Many of those competencies
and abilities are psychological in nature. Apart from earlier approaches (see e.g., [61]) Tanner and
Christen [62] proposed an adapted framework termed “Moral Intelligence” that describes the process
logic of moral behaviour by taking into account fundamental knowledge about implicit and explicit
psychological processes and theoretical insights into morality, and superimposed on this, aiming at
translating these processes into competencies. The framework includes a content-related component
along a set of motivational, perceptive, decisional and action-related abilities. Besides that, progress in
cognitive and social neuroscience has led to investigations of other important social constructs such
as empathy and morality (see e.g., Jefferson Scale of Empathy, the multifaceted empathy test with
one study revealing reduction of the “negativity bias” in patients with treatment-resistant depression
by DBS [63], or the moral foundation scale by Haidt and the moral attentiveness scale by Reynolds).
These and other strains of research, therefore, bear witness to the importance of identifying key
competencies of human moral ability and how those competencies are rooted within and affected by
psychological processes. Because moral competencies, such as the ability to recognize ethical issues in
everyday situations, inﬂuences a person’s cognitions, motivations, and behaviours, changes in these
competencies can lead to complex, personality-related changes. Other moral-related competencies
include the possession of a more distinct desire to strive for moral goals, self-regulatory skills, the ability
to resolve conﬂicting tendencies or being more prone to act consistently and courageously despite
internal or external barriers. This rich variety of different skills that can be expressed in different
degrees in part account for why people act uniquely and why they display unique personalities.
4.2. Thinking Ahead: Operationalization of Moral Competencies as an Exemplary Case
As an example, one particular psychological competency that is relevant in the context of
moral behaviour is moral sensitivity (MS) [64], the ability to recognize (moral) issues in a given
234

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 40

situation. Being conceptualizes as the ﬁrst competency in the process logic of human moral
behaviour (see Rest’s (1986) multi stage model of moral functioning [61] or the framework of Moral
Intelligence [62]), moral sensitivity is an indispensable competence to enter decision-making processes
and moral behaviour in general. Hypothetically, it might be possible that DBS constrains the sensitivity
of an individual in such a way that makes it difﬁcult for the patient to recognize that a given person
might be harmed by certain actions, even though he is generally of the opinion that one should
abstain from harming others. To be sure, changes in moral information processing are likely to
occur also secondary to pathological processes and (e.g., pharmacological) treatment approaches.
The use of reﬁned instruments that depict neuropsychological competencies is, therefore, not limited to
DBS. The decreased sensitivity to recognize e.g., the harming nature of certain actions following
DBS intervention could symbolize a basis for explaining complex personality-related changes.
Notably, there is a difference between the inability to subconsciously recognize that a given value
might be harmed and the deliberate convictions somebody holds. While such ﬁne-grained changes
can sometimes be assessed by conducting qualitative semi-structured interviews in patients [20],
the latter are often impracticable due to the time-consuming steps of post-coding. Often enough,
in times of evidence-based medicine, and hence a quantitatively oriented medical discipline, effects are
only becoming a relevant aspect of research if they can reliably be measured. Hence, quantitative
instruments should supplement qualitative research, thereby emphasizing the prima facie importance
of more vigorously investigating personality. Most importantly, and in order to safeguard clinical
meaningfulness, abstract clinical scale-improvements have to be associated with an actual improvement
in the individual patient’s life. While there were e.g., reports documenting measurable cognitive
declines, the latter were found not to be very relevant for patients’ QoL. That the same holds for
slight changes in personality is less likely, since changes in one’s personality are more probable to
have an impact on daily life by being able to endanger relationships and family life [22]. They often
affect interpersonal relations and inﬂict greater burden on caregivers [65], apart from the fact that
changes can be subtle so that patients themselves may be unaware of them [66]. Statistically signiﬁcant
efﬁcacy is, therefore, only a necessary, but not a sufﬁcient condition, as it does not always correspond
to meaningful changes. QoL assessments are one way to document clinical meaningfulness, but the
construct itself is very difﬁcult to assess (e.g., unrealistic expectations about DBS outcomes can
fundamentally inﬂuence QoL in that no improvement is seen in QoL despite motor improvement).
By aligning our own research to the mentioned need, we recently have built a computerized instrument
to measure MS by taking into account recent insights from moral psychology [67]. Needless to say,
instruments need to satisfy common psychodiagnostic standards including reliability, validity and
other quality characteristics of psychological test-theory in order to guarantee that these instruments
measure what they intend to measure and with the requisite precision.
Challenges of the instrument development process are multifaceted and include
e.g., the incorporation of vague quantiﬁers in the context of psychosocial functioning. The step of
specifying basic components is therefore utterly important. In addition, the delicate nature of the
instruments’ content, covering morality including e.g., anti-social compulsions or sexual urges, poses
implicit challenges to instrument development and data acquisition. Besides that, there might be the
problem of overlapping functions denoting the difﬁculty of dissociating competencies that result in
moral action. Instruments should likewise, to some degree, adhere to the criterion of generalizability
or, as a minimum criterion, context-dependent instruments would need some form of justiﬁcation.
They are also expected to refrain from provoking biased responses by e.g., avoiding including the terms
“ethical” and “moral”. In addition, instruments should take up recent insights of moral-psychological
research. Correspondingly, instruments that are entirely based on self-reports are susceptible to
bias, due to the provocation of social-desirable answer tendencies or e.g., reduced awareness based
on frontal-subcortical circuit dysfunction. Finally, the methodological requirements should be as
low as possible: because the categorization (post-coding) of issues (mentioned by participants) is
time-consuming and requires the analysis of inter-rater-reliabilities, and because some implicit

235

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 40

measurements impose participants to work on computers and in controlled environments, they are
unsuited for quantitative research approaches.
In sum, in the context of neuropsychological competencies of socio-moral information processing,
even fewer instruments exist at present. Future instruments that focus on socio-moral functioning
should comply with the requirements of psychological test theory besides taking up recent insights of
(moral) psychological research.
4.3. Future Use and Advantage of Instruments Measuring Moral Competencies
Generally, the deployment of instruments that measure psychosocial functioning are conceivable
for the referral practice in DBS interventions and as diagnostic outcome-measures in order to measure
pre-post DBS effects. The prospective measurement of complex changes may help with making
predictions regarding who is likely to experience clinically signiﬁcant personality-related alterations,
making individualized counselling possible, and aiming at minimizing negative impacts on patients
and their families.
Because competencies are believed to be ﬂexible entities that evolve and change over time,
the focus on psychosocial competencies might encourage investigating means for modulating such
competencies for the better, as a potential form of therapeutic interventions. By such an approach,
subjects have the opportunity to inimitably learn more about as well as speciﬁcally train ones’
own competencies.
5. Conclusions
Whilst DBS has provided hope for a large number of patients and while a number of scales for
e.g., assessing motor changes have been developed during the last years, there is a conspicuous
lack of instruments that target and adequately depict personality-related changes speciﬁcally.
Standardized questionnaires and tests are available, but they may not reﬂect sufﬁciently the
behavioural changes and their effects in real life. Together with the highlighted lack of sensitive
instruments, an appreciation of the concrete incidence of personality-related changes (evoked by DBS
or other treatment approaches) is impossible. Therefore, there is great need for reﬁned instruments that
quantify complex, personality-related changes at a satisfactory level. While the clinical signiﬁcance of
any measured change has to be demonstrated, the frequency of such changes has to be investigated
by representative samples and prospective study designs in order to systematically investigate these
changes in patients relative to controls. Because such instruments may explain causal elements for
the emergence of conﬂicting outcome interpretations and social maladjustment that are relevant for
patients and their relatives, such research is desperately needed. Integrating caregivers and families’
perceptions of the patient and the impact on their life would complement this complex investigation,
thereby safeguarding clinical meaningfulness. Given the challenge patients may face when ﬁnding
a “new” personality after being freed from the motor symptoms, and the subsequent loss of (motor)
autonomy that kept them fettered to PD, it is utterly important to give patients, their relatives and
clinicians means for granting ways for measuring and assessing changes in an appropriate way. Hence,
the time is rife for advancing DBS treatment along both the technological axis, and an axis that involves
the holistic assessment including personality in its full intricacy in order to provide further help to
many patients. Besides empirical research that includes the development of instruments and the
systematic and longitudinal investigation of complex changes that relate to personality, conceptual
investigation on identity and qualitative research with patients, their relatives and clinicians are highly
relevant. It is only with the construction of sensitive instruments, allowing a subtle measurement
of the type of change, that an evaluation of the positive or negative nature of change is possible.
Finally, besides a clinical, it is also an ethical requirement to further investigate complex changes in
order to responsibly apply DBS.

Abstract: Tourette syndrome (TS) is a childhood neurobehavioural disorder, characterised by the
presence of motor and vocal tics, typically starting in childhood but persisting in around 20% of
patients into adulthood. In those patients who do not respond to pharmacological or behavioural
therapy, deep brain stimulation (DBS) may be a suitable option for potential symptom improvement.
This manuscript attempts to summarise the outcomes of DBS at different targets, explore the possible
mechanisms of action of DBS in TS, as well as the potential of adaptive DBS. There will also be a focus
on the future challenges faced in designing optimized trials.
Keywords: Tourette syndrome; TS deep brain stimulation; DBS

1. Introduction
Tourette syndrome (TS) is a childhood neurobehavioural disorder affecting approximately
0.3%–0.8% of the paediatric population [1]. It is deﬁned by the presence of at least one vocal and
two motor tics starting before the age of 18, lasting longer than one year, with the exclusion of other
causes [2]. Tics are often preceded by a premonitory urge [3] tend to occur daily in variable bouts
and follow a waxing and waning course. The typical age of onset is ﬁve to seven years [4] with
symptoms peaking at puberty and often remitting into early adulthood. In around 20% of patients,
symptoms persist and have a detrimental effect on quality of life including social, professional and
educational development [5]. Psychiatric co-morbidities are experienced in approximately 50%–90% of
TS individuals, particularly obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD/OCB), attention deﬁcit hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD), deliberate self-injurious behaviours (SIBs) along with disturbances in mood and
anxiety [6]. Current treatments include a combination of pharmacological and behavioural therapies.
However, in patients with disabling refractory symptoms, surgical intervention, such as deep brain
stimulation (DBS), may be considered a potential option for symptom improvement.
DBS has been applied to patients with both hypokinetic and hyperkinetic movement disorders
including Parkinson’s disease, dystonia and essential tremor, as well as neuropsychiatric disorders
such as treatment-resistant depression and OCD [7]. Targets of DBS for TS are based on the postulated
dysfunction of the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops. A simplistic proposal is that aberrant activity
in groups of striatal medium spiny neurons [8] lead to a decrease in the inhibitory output of the globus
pallidus internus (GPi), resulting in disinhibition and the execution of involuntary cortical motor
commands in the form of repetitive, stereotyped movements. A variety of methods, such as structural
imaging in longitudinal studies of TS patients, have correlated smaller caudate nucleus volumes with
severity of tics, as well as changes in the diffusivity of water molecules in the frontal lobe and thalamus
as measured by diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging [9]. Decreased connectivity between

caudate nucleus and lateral frontal cortex has been observed, supporting a cortical disinhibition
theory for the disorder [10] though contradictory ﬁndings have also been reported [11] and the precise
pathophysiology of TS remains unknown.
The current manuscript attempts to provide an updated review of the published literature
regarding the use of DBS for severe, medication refractory Tourette syndrome. A particular focus has
been (1) to understand the potential mechanisms of action of this therapy based on neurophysiological
recordings and neuroanatomical knowledge of the basal ganglia circuity; and (2) to make
recommendations for the future evaluation of the use of DBS in TS.
2. Methods
A broad search was carried out using the databases Pubmed and OVID Medline with a variety
of terms including “Tourette syndrome“, “GTS“, combined with “deep brain stimulation“ or “DBS“.
Each target region for DBS, including the “thalamus“ “globus pallidus internus“ “anterior limb internal
capsule“ “nucleus accumbens“, “globus pallidus externus“ were combined with the above terms.
Only references in the English language were included.
3. Literature Review
Currently, nine targets have been used in DBS for TS, including the thalamic centromedian
parafascicular complex (CMPf), the cross point of the centromedian nucleus-substantia
periventricularis-nucleus ventro-oralis nucleus (CM-Spv-Voi), the target of the nucleus ventro-oralis
posterior-ventro oralis anterior-Voi complex (Vop-Voa-Voi), the globus pallidus internus (GPi)
(anteromedial AND posteroventral regions), the nucleus accumbens (NA), the anterior limb of the
internal capsule (ALIC), the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the globus pallidus externus (GPe) [12].
Known connections between nuclei targeted by TS DBS, as well as other structures in the cortico-basal
ganglia network are illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Simplified schematic showing the main connections of the cortico-thalamo-cortical network,
with the nuclei targeted in TS DBS in blue boxes (NA = nucleus accumbens, ALIC = anterior limb internal
capsule, CMPf centromedian parafasciular complex, CM Sp Voi, centromedian nucleus-substantia
periventricularis-nucleus ventro-oralis nucleus, the nucleus ventro-oralis posterior-ventro oralis anterior
ventro-oralis complex (Vop-Voa-Voi), GPe = globus pallidus externus, STN = subthalamic nucleus,
GPi (am, pv = anteromedial, posteroventral globus pallidus internus). The direct pathway is shown with
black arrows, the indirect pathway with grey arrows and other connections shown with blue arrows.
Projections from the primary motor cortex (M1), the pre-motor cortex (PMC) and the supplementary
motor area (SMA) are predominantly directed to the dorsal striatum (putamen and caudate) whereas
ﬁbers from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) including the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), ventromedial PFC
(vmPFC) and the dorsal PFC (dPFC) as well as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) mostly project to
the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens and rostroventral most aspects of caudate and putamen).
The main output nuclei are the GPi and the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNR). Other regions,
such as the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNC), also have connections with the striatum.

The rationale behind target choice has varied depending on whether tics are considered
a movement disorder in which case sensorimotor areas such as the posteroventral pallidum have
been stimulated or if they are considered to be a compulsion or a failure of inhibition wherein
associative/limbic areas have been targeted [13]. The thalamus and GPi have been the most widely
stimulated with a combination of targets used in some studies. A summary of the results of open
label trials is presented in Table 1, and blinded trials in Table 2. The outcome measures in these
studies relate to tics or co-morbidities and include the Yale global tic severity scale (YGTSS) [14] as
well as the Modiﬁed Rush video rating scale (MRVRS) [15] which measure tic frequency, severity and
impairment levels. The Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive scale (Y-BOCS) [16] assesses the severity of
OCD/OCB symptoms whilst measures of quality of life, anxiety and depression commonly include
the Gilles de la Tourette quality of life (GTS-QOL) scale [17] State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and
Beck depression inventory (BDI), respectively, which have been validated for use in TS.
3.1. Thalamic Targets
Motor patterns in TS are postulated to result in part from an increased thalamocortical drive
due to inappropriate activation of striatal neurons [18]. There is an excitatory feedback loop from the
thalamus to the striatum originating in the CMPf and midline thalamic nuclei [19], which are the most
common thalamic targets for TS DBS.
The ﬁrst report of DBS for the treatment of refractory TS by Visser-Vandewalle, used the same
thalamic nuclei (centromedian-parafasciucular complex (CM/Pf), and ventral oral internus nuclei
(Voi)) that Hassler and Dieckmann had targeted in stereotactic ablation in 1970. This individual was
a 42 years old male who subsequently experienced a 90% improvement in his tics at 12 months [20]
although using stimulation parameters with extremely high charge density, in comparison to those
used in Parkinson’s disease. In 2003, the same group reported three patients including the above who
showed a 72%–90% improvement in tics over a follow up of between eight months and ﬁve years [21].
In two of three patients the co-morbidities of SIB and OCD were also no longer present. The main
adverse effects reported were either a reduction or increase in sexual drive in two patients along
with reduced energy levels. In the larger series of 18 patients who were followed up between 3 and
18 months [22] YGTSS improvement varied between 24% and 79% in 15 of 18 patients with a concurrent
improvement in co-morbidities. A longer follow up study [23] of 15 males after ﬁve to six years showed
a mean YGTSS improvement of 73% and YBOCS of 42%. Adverse effects included a scalp erosion due
to compulsive picking, and an abdominal haematoma. These and other open label studies [24–38] are
outlined in Table 1 and strongly indicated that thalamic stimulation may have a beneﬁcial therapeutic
role in TS for both tic severity as well as comorbid symptoms.
However, the results of two randomised controlled trials showed a more variable response.
In 2007, the anterior part of the CMPf complex was targeted in ﬁve male patients, with only a
mean improvement in tics of 17% in the YGTSS when blindly comparing ON vs. OFF stimulation.
However, three of the ﬁve responded with a 50% average reduction of tics following open label
stimulation at three months, though no biomarker could distinguish responders from non-responders.
Measures of OCD, depression and anxiety demonstrated a trend towards improvement, with a 44%
increase in the YBOCS whilst one patient experienced a psychotic episode [39]. A more recent double
blind crossover study targeted the CM-Spv-Voi assessing 6 male patients who were randomly assigned
to three months on stimulation and three months off or vice versa. At a group level improvement in tic
control during the off and on condition was 2.8% and 39.4% respectively. After one year open label
follow up, these levels were maintained at 49.2% on YGTSS and 35.5% on the MRVRS [40].

3.2. Globus Pallidus Internus (GPi)
The GPi is considered to be functionally segregated into an anteromedial region which is part
of the associative/limbic loop of the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuit, while the posteroventral
region is involved in the motor loop of the parallel circuit. However, there is much convergence of
both limbic and motor inputs in both segments of the GPi [65]. Therefore, there has been much debate
as to which sub-region might respond best to DBS for TS. The posteroventral target is familiar territory
to functional neurosurgeons as it has been stimulated in other hyperkinetic movement disorders, such
as Parkinson’s disease (PD) and various forms of dystonia.
3.2.1. Posteroventral GPi
The results of open label studies of DBS of the posteroventral GPi region in TS
patients [24,41,45,46,49,52,54,55,57,58] are also listed in Table 1. The range of tic improvement has been
20%–92.9% at 6–39 months follow up [41,45,46,52,54,55,57], with serious side effects including a small
haemorrhage in the right GPi at surgery resulting in a persistent bradykinesia of the left hand in one
27 year old male [41] and complaints of depression [46]. In a four patient cohort [52], two patients were
non-responders and two experienced an improvement in YGTSS of up to 88%, whilst in a long-term
outcome study of 13 patients YGTSS improved by 52.1% with a wide range of 4.3%–83.6% over a mean
follow up of 13–80 months) [58]. Stimulation in a 16 year old boy with TS and severe mental retardation
led to lack of symptom improvement, attributed to his severe co-morbidity [49]. Despite the variable
response at this target it may be preferred in patients with dystonic tics [66].
3.2.2. Anteromedial GPi
The rationale for targeting the anteromedial GPi region is based on the associative-limbic
connections that may impact the underlying urge driving the expression of motor and phonic tics.
A summary of the results of open label trials is also presented in Table 1 [52,56,59–61] with the amGPi
demonstrating tic improvement ranging from 38% to 71.5% [52,56,59–61] in patients followed up
between 4 and 46 months, with anxiety reported as an adverse effect [56,59].
However, when evaluated using a randomised crossover trial methodology in 15 patients,
comparison of blinded ON stimulation vs. OFF stimulation periods showed a mean YGTSS
improvement of only 15.3% although with substantial variability between patients. With long-term
follow up assessment, patients showed a 40.1% improvement in tics and 38.9% improvement in quality
of life [64] leading to discussion about factors which may inﬂuence the outcome of DBS surgery when
evaluated using blinded trial methods [67].
3.3. Other Targets
The Subthalamic nucleus (STN), External Globus pallidus (GPe), Anterior limb of
Internal capsule (ALIC) and Nucleus Accumbens (NA) have been less frequent targets for
stimulation [26,36,42–44,47,48,50,51,53,54,68]. The result of STN stimulation has only been reported
in one patient who had both PD and TS with DBS resulting in a 97% improvement in tics along with
relief of PD symptoms [51]. One male patient stimulated in the GPe region showed a 70.5% increase in
YGTSS and a 75% improvement in anxiety [68]. Although limited by study design and sample size,
the above results certainly suggest that the STN and GPe show promise as targets of stimulation and
warrant further study.
The NA and ALIC have been used as a target in treatment-resistant OCD and have been chosen
as potential stimulation targets in some circumstances owing to the frequent OCD comorbidity seen in
TS [69]. Open label studies have shown tic improvement of between 25% and 45% [42–44,48,50] at up
to 34 months follow up with adverse effects including rapid internal pulse generator depletion in one
patient requiring 2 replacement in 36 months [48]. However, in one case report there was no beneﬁt
from NA stimulation [47].

249

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 35

3.4. Comparative Studies
In a randomised crossover study, three patients had electrodes placed in both the thalamus and
the anteromedial GPi, stimulation resulting in a YGTSS improvement of 65%–96% for amGPi, 30%–64%
for CMPf and 43%–76% in combination stimulation. Follow up for as long as 60 months in 1 patient
demonstrated maintenance of tic improvement. Pallidal stimulation appeared to be more effective for
tic reduction than thalamic or even combination stimulation. However, depressive mood, anxiety and
impulsiveness were not affected by pallidal stimulation alone, whilst they showed improvement in
thalamic or combination stimulation. The thalamic and pallidal targets gave rise to varying adverse
effects with the former including arm paraesthesia and reduced libido whilst the latter included
increased anxiety [62,63].
The ALIC, which has been used for sterotactic lesioning in OCD patients and contains ﬁbers that
travel between the orbitofrontal cortex and the anterodorsal thalamus was stimulated in a 37 year
old female with TS. This resulted in a 25% improvement on the YGTSS, but caused apathy or
hypomania as side effects. The target was subsequently switched to the CMPf of the thalamus [42,43]
resulting in a YGTSS improvement of 32% with cessation of SIBs that had led to retinal detachment.
In a four patient cohort, two patients who had previous surgery at the CM-Pf-Vo, subsequently
had ALIC/NA stimulation as rescue surgery with combined stimulation demonstrating superior
tic reduction (82.6% than ALIC/NA only (68.1%)) [43]. These comparative studies can inform whether
speciﬁc targets have a differential effect on tics and co-morbid symptoms which could impact target
selection for TS patients with different co-morbidities.
3.5. Clinical Outcome and Targets
In a recent systematic review the thalamic targets of DBS were found to improve YGTSS
scores by an average of 47.62% p < 0.001 with comparable results for GPi (55.32%), whilst the
ALIC/NA regions showed a 44% improvement (p = 0.017) albeit in a smaller number of patients [70].
Direct comparisons between targets generally also indicate a lesser effect with ALIC stimulation [50,53].
The co-morbidity outcome across targets revealed a median 31.25% reduction in YBOCS and 38.89% in
BDI, but without any statistically signiﬁcant difference in the outcome of tics or co-morbidity. It should
be considered that clinical outcomes are attributed to the target yet the anatomical brain regions
ultimately stimulated by DBS depend on precise electrode placing, stimulation parameters, as well as
individual anatomical variation [70]. The development of computer models using electrode location
and extent of current spread has enabled investigation of the electric ﬁeld distribution in individual
patients using proton-density magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. In one such study of ﬁve
patients who had DBS targeting the amGPi, patient-speciﬁc stimulation conﬁrmed this region to be
the main stimulation ﬁeld. However, three patients showed possible extension into GPe and internal
capsule and in two patients with clear extension into the anterior GPe, there was a superior clinical
effect. This highlights the importance of analysing the exact position of effective stimulation contacts
and correlating outcome with patient speciﬁc stimulation ﬁelds in order to obtain more valid results
about optimal target [71].
Although no deﬁnitive predictive factors for improved tic outcome have been identiﬁed, a positive
correlation was observed between pre-operative YGTSS impairment score and tic reduction following
amGPi DBS (p = 0.01), whilst the opposite effect was seen for pre-operative YGTSS tic severity
and outcome following thalamic DBS. Furthermore there was no correlation between severity of
co-morbidity symptoms or with stimulation parameters and tic outcome [70]. This meta-analysis
did ﬁnd a trend towards younger age and improved outcome, suggesting that the neurobiological
underpinnings of TS are better impacted by stimulation in the younger population. Interpretation
is limited by pooling of results from sub-regions of the thalamus or ventral striatum which could
be improved by using individual co-ordinates and settings though these are not always available.
These ﬁndings nevertheless remain informative and suggest that higher YGTSS impairment scores,

250

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 35

tic severity, patient age and choice of preferred target should all be considered in the selection of
patients for DBS.
3.6. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
The suitability of DBS in TS patients depends on many factors yet there is much variability
around speciﬁc inclusion and exclusion criteria across studies. Typically, core criteria focus on accurate
diagnosis, high tic severity (typically a YGTSS score >35/50) and resistance to at least three different
pharmacological agents [72]. Although psychiatric co-morbidity is a common component of TS,
motor and vocal tics should be the main source of disability [7]. In addition, realistic expectations
of DBS outcome and adequate social support [22], as well as compliance in attending appointments
for outcome assessment or alteration of parameter settings is crucial when selecting patients for DBS.
These should all be considered in a multidisciplinary team setting including a neurologist, psychiatrist,
neurosurgeon and psychologist.
Exclusion criteria typically include major psychiatric disorders, pregnancy, current substance
abuse or dependence and severe cognitive impairment, (supported by a study showing a lack of beneﬁt
in a 16 year old boy with TS and mental retardation undergoing DBS, although the outcome of this
single case report should not be over-interpreted [49]). Other factors warranting exclusion include
structural abnormalities on MRI, general contra-indications for surgery and patients with somatoform
disorder [61] which have also been outlined in the European guidelines for TS [73]. Some centres
have also used age as an exclusion criteria, restricting DBS to patients over 18 or 25 [73], based on
the premise that TS may subside into adulthood and that there are ethical implications for placing
patients under potentially unnecessary surgical risk. Nonetheless, adolescence is a crucial period
for social, emotional and educational development and preventing younger patients with severe
debilitating TS receiving treatment could impact negatively on independence and wellbeing into adult
life. This is supported by beneﬁcial reports in younger patients including a 17 year old with SIBs
that prevented full time school attendance who showed markedly improved social integration post
DBS [37]. Consequently, recent recommendations argue against strict age criteria and suggest that
younger patients should be reviewed on a case by case basis, involving a local ethics committee.
3.7. Adverse Effects
Adverse effects can be classiﬁed into procedure or stimulation related events with some
stimulation effects varying between targets. Stimulating the thalamic CM-Spv-Voi region has been
associated with gaze disturbances or visual symptoms which are less often seen when targeting motor
regions of the thalamus [34]. Other adverse effects include increased or decreased libido, which can
result from modulating certain parts of intra-laminar thalamic nuclei involved in controlling sexual
function [74]. In addition, arm paraesthesia, dysarthria and a case of psychosis have been reported.
Stimulation of the pvGPi has been associated with increased anxiety, depression and memory
impairment [33], whilst that of the amGPi has also been related to higher anxiety levels, dyskinetic
limb movements and a case of hypomania [64]. Stimulation of the ALIC/NA was linked to side effects
such as depression, hypomania, as well as a suicide attempt reported in an NA patient with known
depressive episodes. The adverse effects of apathy, fatigue, dizziness and weight changes are more
common across targets and in many instances adjustment of the stimulation parameters can diminish
or eradicate these but target selection should aim to limit their effects.
Procedure related adverse effects mostly centre around hardware malfunction and infections with
the latter appearing to be higher in TS compared to other movement disorders. This was suggested by
a retrospective study of 272 DBS patients, 39 of whom were treated for TS and showed an overall 3.7%
infection rate whilst for TS this was 18 [75]. The higher rate of infection in TS patients was attributed
to the compulsive picking at surgical scars in some patients [75] though altered immune function
has also been postulated including lower T cell count [76], dysgammaglobulinemia, or an altered
immunomodulatory effect of dopamine [77], though this requires further investigation.

251

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 35

3.8. Mechanisms of DBS Action in TS
DBS has demonstrated improvement in patient symptoms across targets yet much remains
to be elucidated about its mechanism of action. Some studies have investigated the role of
DBS in the dopaminergic modulation of striatothalamic pathways, supported by the postulated
hyper-dopaminergic innervation in TS pathology and the use of dopamine antagonists in TS treatment.
The ﬁrst report of modulation of dopaminergic transmission with DBS was in a 22 years old patient who
had undergone bilateral thalamic stimulation with a resultant improvement in tics [78]. Six months
post surgery [8 F] fallypride (FP) positron emission tomography (PET) scans, which quantiﬁed the
striatal and extrastriatal dopamine 2/3 (D2/3) receptors, showed a 16.3% decrease in dopamine
binding potential during on-stimulation compared to off-stimulation conditions, suggesting that DBS
may indirectly cause a decrease in dopamine release. In addition, there was an increase in D2/3
receptor availability in the baseline on condition compared to healthy control subjects (n = 20) based
on a published control group. A further study using FP PET scans on three patients receiving thalamic
DBS demonstrated similar results in dopamine binding during DBS [79]. Although these studies are
limited by small sample size and potential anaesthetic effect, they indicate that dopamine modulation
may be a component of the therapeutic impact of DBS.
It had previously been shown using electroencephalography that premotor potentials did
not precede simple motor tics in TS suggesting that the cortex was not their site of origin [80,81]
though more recent contradictory ﬁndings have also been published [82]. Microelectrode recordings
in thalamic nuclei during DBS surgery has typically shown a burst-ﬁring pattern with an interburst
interval ranging from 0.12 to 0.4 s within the low frequency (delta/theta) range (2.5–8 Hz) [83].
Similar results were obtained in a study that demonstrated oscillatory activity at low frequencies [84],
which has also been observed in other hyperkinetic movement disorders, such as dystonia [85]
suggesting that low-frequency activity and decreased thalamic beta activity could contribute to
the pathophysiology of TS. This is supported by correlation with clinical phenotype in a patient
who had few tics but severe OCD showing signiﬁcantly fewer low-frequency oscillations than in
local ﬁeld potentials (LFPs) recorded in patients with severe tics. Further, increased gamma activity
(25–45 Hz) recorded from the CM in awake patients with TS (n = 5) correlated with tic improvement and
demonstrated that DBS increases the power of LFP gamma oscillations [86]. Therefore, shifting basal
ganglia thalamic oscillation power from low to high frequency may be one of the effects of DBS
in TS patients, supported by the correlation between increased CM gamma activity and clinical
tic reduction [86]. Short-term neuronal mechanisms of DBS in TS have also been investigated
using primate models of basal ganglia-mediated motor tics [87]. High frequency stimulation in
the anteromedial GPi was shown to signiﬁcantly reduce the amplitude of tic related phasic changes in
the pallidum most likely caused by cellular activity temporally locking with the stimulation pulse [87].
Neuroplasticity is also being recognised as relevant to the effects of DBS supported by the
reported shift in magnitude of long-latency response components across stimulation blocks [87].
However in a study investigating thalamic LFP recordings in a 48 years old male with Tourette
syndrome 12 months after DBS, LFPs remained in the low frequency range as observed a few days after
initial DBS implantation, suggesting that DBS may not cause a persistent change in LFP oscillation
pattern [88] though this requires investigation in more patients. Evidence has implicated microglia
in the modiﬁcation of synaptic connections and plasticity which could contribute to functionally
immature control networks typical of that seen in TS. The role of DBS in altering the immunobiology
of the brain in TS is an interesting avenue of research [89].
Mechanisms of DBS in TS should continue to be explored as they inform both the pathophysiology
of the disorder and ways in which DBS delivery can be optimized in patients. When considering the
search for an optimal target, the high interconnectivity of basal ganglia structures means it is likely
that stimulation in one area will have profound downstream or upstream effects in others and rather
than the target being a speciﬁc focus of pathology, it may instead block propagation of aberrant signals
through a local network [87]. As DBS currents spread through anatomical connections, it may be
252

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 35

useful to consider the effect of target stimulation on these different brain networks through a variety
of imaging techniques. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) compatible DBS systems could
be used to map cortical-subcortical circuits [90] and patient speciﬁc tractography activation models
(TAMs) could identify white matter pathways and monitor the projections being activated by DBS in
individual patients [91]. Resting state functional connectivity MRI, which has previously been used
to identify thalamic DBS targets based on connectivity to brain regions in tremor could be applied in
a similar way to tics in TS [92]. These methods may help motivate a shift to the stimulation of speciﬁc
brain networks and potentially customise treatment for varying patient phenotypes.
3.9. Adaptive DBS in TS
Further research into neurophysiological recordings in TS patients can also inform the potential
future application of adaptive rather than continuous DBS which may be particularly relevant due
to the paroxysmal nature of TS [93]. An adaptive DBS system would allow the pathological neural
activity of patients to be used as feedback through variables, such as LFPs recorded by DBS electrodes,
informing when tics will arise and leading to a responsive alteration in stimulation to suppress their onset.
The ﬁnding that increased gamma band activity and reduced alpha band power in the CM
complex of the thalamus correlated with superior clinical outcome [86] could be the starting point
for developing speciﬁc neural markers correlating with tic onset. Moreover, the GPi has been seen
to exhibit low frequency oscillations that precede the electromyographic recording of tics by 50 ms
or more, and may mark the premonitory urge of motor tics [88], whilst LFP recordings in ALIC/NA,
have shown high beta power oscillations, a potential physiological indicator of OCD activity [88].
However, the reliability of feedback algorithms and the accuracy of correlation of variables such as
LFPs with clinical symptoms requires much investigation, particularly as the latter can differ between
tic types and individual patients [94] A proof of principle study showed the beneﬁcial effects of
scheduled DBS in TS patients [32] and though a closed loop system was not employed it may provide
the foundation for applying neuromodulatory approaches. The beneﬁts of an adaptive DBS system
pertain to the reduced energy expenditure leading to a prolonged battery life [95], as well as a reduction
in stimulation related side effects, such as fatigue or anxiety, potentially further improving patient
quality of life.
Nonetheless, the use of adaptive DBS remains highly experimental in all conditions, not least until
a consistent neurophysiological biomarker for tic urge is identiﬁed and issues of sustained efﬁcacy and
potential side effects have been thoroughly investigated in future trials and studies.
4. Discussion
Stimulation applied to different cortico-basal ganglia thalamic network structures appears to
improve motor and non-motor symptoms in TS. However, over-interpretation of ‘between target
comparisons’ of these results is unwise as most data are derived from case reports and small
prospective series with wide variability in methodology. Although more double-blind controlled
studies are required, designing these to ensure adequate optimization of stimulation settings as well as
maintenance of patient and investigator blinding can be a challenge [67].
Therefore, study design and patient selection should be carefully considered in the future in order
to investigate the relative strength of treatments across studies.
Establishing an optimal target has been controversial as the precise pathophysiology of TS is not
yet elucidated and stimulated structures have high interconnectivity. To date, the most commonly used
targets have been the thalamus and GPi, which have shown variable but overall promising results.
Many patients with electrodes targeting the GPi will have electrode trajectories that also straddle the
GPe. Reviewing the data in Tables 1 and 2, the optimal stimulation parameters often include the more
dorsal electrodes therefore potentially also preferentially delivering stimulation to the GPe ﬁbres.
Only single studies have investigated the STN and the GPe despite demonstrating beneﬁcial effects
in tic reduction. Further, the STN is known to have an excitatory inﬂuence on the GPi, which could be

253

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 35

manipulated to affect both the limbic and sensorimotor circuits to a greater extent than using the GPi
or thalamus alone. Further insight into the cortico-subcortical networks stimulated by DBS through
different imaging modalities will further inform optimal targeting.
Looking closer at patient speciﬁc factors related to variability of response could help reveal
predictive factors for improved outcome. Results of a meta-analysis suggesting that higher
pre-operative YGTSS impairment and younger age in patients targeted in the GPi region, correlated
with better tic outcome in the may also inform future inclusion and exclusion criteria. Furthermore,
correlating clinical outcome to speciﬁc ﬁelds of stimulation based on patient speciﬁc computer models,
may contribute to a more accurate mapping of the optimal target within structures like the GPi/GPe.
Study outcomes have focused on tic reduction using rating scales, such as the YGTSS, and although
these are validated and include measures of overall impairment, they are not always an accurate
reﬂection of tic impact on self-esteem and socio-professional life. The social integration of TS patients
should be a considered a vital aim of the DBS procedure, determined not only by a reduction in tics,
but often more importantly, by that of co-morbid symptoms. Consequently, it is crucial that studies
uniformly use scales such as the GTS-QOL, STAI and BDI in order to compare quality of life and
co-morbidity outcomes across targets. Further, supportive accounts from caregivers can also increase
the accuracy of clinical evaluation.
In order to further assess the efﬁcacy of thalamic DBS there is a need for larger, multi-centre trials
with careful consideration of optimal trial design to ensure the outcome of this intervention can be
objectively assessed. One proposal would be to perform a direct comparison of thalamic (CMPf) DBS
against anteromedial GPI/GPe DBS with the latter electrodes deliberately straddling both GPi and
GPe targets. Intraoperative and post-operative recordings from externalized electrodes will continue
to be informative regarding the neurophysiological changes associated with tics and OCD/OCB.
Conﬁrmation of dopaminergic receptor occupancy post DBS using functional imaging techniques
would be useful.
To compare the clinical efﬁcacy of two targets requires a sufﬁciently long period of time for
resolution of surgical swelling and wound healing and stimulation parameters can require long
periods before considered optimized. Objective conﬁrmation of efﬁcacy must also include an off
stimulation assessment, brief if necessary to allow the impact of stimulation to be distinguished from
placebo effects. There is now a worldwide consortium of clinicians including functional neurosurgeons
interested in DBS and the design of such future trials are the subject of ongoing discussions.
5. Conclusions
Despite variable outcomes between patients, DBS for TS has shown much promise across targets.
The careful design of randomised trials, use of comparative studies and imaging modalities in DBS
systems can inform target selection. Considering that the ultimate aim of this procedure is the social
integration of patients, future studies should continue to address the treatment of both tics and
co-morbidities. Further elucidating the mechanisms of DBS action can help enable its optimization,
inform the pathophysiology of TS and future potential applications of adaptive DBS.

Abstract: The amygdala plays a critical role in emotion regulation. It could prove to be an effective
neuromodulation target in the treatment of psychiatric conditions characterized by failure of
extinction. We aim to describe our targeting technique, and intra-operative and post-operative
electrodiagnostic ﬁndings associated with the placement of deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes
in the amygdala. We used a transfrontal approach to implant DBS electrodes in the basolateral
nucleus of the amygdala (BLn) of a patient suffering from severe post-traumatic stress disorder.
We used microelectrode recording (MER) and awake intra-operative neurostimulation to assist with
the placement. Post-operatively, the patient underwent monthly surveillance electroencephalograms
(EEG). MER predicted the trajectory of the electrode through the amygdala. The right BLn showed
a higher spike frequency than the left BLn. Intra-operative neurostimulation of the BLn elicited
pleasant memories. The monthly EEG showed the presence of more sleep patterns over time with DBS.
BLn DBS electrodes can be placed using a transfrontal approach. MER can predict the trajectory of
the electrode in the amygdala and it may reﬂect the BLn neuronal activity underlying post-traumatic
stress disorder PTSD. The EEG ﬁndings may underscore the reduction in anxiety.

1. Introduction
The amygdala is a critical node within a network that regulates emotions. Two functional zones
of the amygdala are especially important in this role. The centromedial group is the output of
the amygdala: through its efferent connections, it orchestrates the physiological and behavioral
components of emotions [1]. The basolateral group receives sensory input and it links emotions to
stimuli [2,3]. This function is particularly important because it deﬁnes the behavior manifested in
response to a stimulus. To fulﬁll its role, the basolateral amygdala receives modulatory inputs from the
medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and several other regions, such as the hippocampus and the ventral
tegmental area [4,5].

Because it deﬁnes the emotional context of behavior, the amygdala has been surgically targeted
for intractable psychiatric conditions. Bilateral transfrontal stereotactic amygdalotomies have been
performed for patients suffering from intractable aggressiveness [6]. In these cases, aggression was
targeted as a symptom regardless of the speciﬁc underlying psychiatric condition. The amygdala was
understood as a center of fear and anger. Recent studies have shown that the amygdala links both
positive as well as negative emotions to stimuli (for review [3]). The amygdala determines if a stimulus
should elicit fear (association) or not (extinction). In fact, the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala BLn
contains “fear cells” that are active during fear acquisition and consolidation and “extinction cells” that
are active during fear extinction [4]. Emotional extinction is a delicate process by which the basolateral
nucleus (BLn) learns to no longer elicit an emotion in response to a stimulus. This learning process
likely requires plasticity in the BLn, in part induced by modulation from the mPFC [2], whereby a
larger population of extinction cells is activated relative to fear cells. In this sense, the BLn can be seen
as an emotional receptive ﬁeld modulated by the mPFC, the hippocampus and several other regions [7].
The relative population of active fear cells and extinction cells can therefore determine the speciﬁc
response to a reminder. An intense stimulus, such as a life-threatening event, may overwhelm this
learning process by forming a stereotypical neurophysiological response in the BLn. In post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD), a life-threatening event leads to a state of failure of fear extinction that may be
understood as a neuroplasticity failure to re-engage extinction cells. In this context, neuromodulation
could be focally applied to the BLn to restore fear extinction by modifying the relative volume of active
fear cells compared to extinction cells.
Indeed, we have previously shown that BLn deep brain stimulation (DBS) can promote fear
extinction in a rodent model of PTSD [8,9]. This effect could translate in patients suffering from PTSD.
We are performing an early-phase trial evaluating BLn DBS for treatment-refractory PTSD [10]. In this
paper, we aim to describe our targeting technique and intraoperative microelectrode recording (MER)
results in a case of bilateral BLn DBS electrode placements. We are aware of only one other human
BLn DBS case: a teenage boy was treated successfully for treatment-refractory self-mutilating behavior
in the context of severe autism [11].
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Subject
Our subject is a Gulf War veteran who developed PTSD from participation in a military assault and
the subsequent exposure to the bodies of enemy combatants. His baseline Clinician Administered PTSD
Scale (CAPS) [12] score was 119, classifying him among the most severely ill patients. He suffered from
vivid nightmares during which charred corpses would surround him. Upon exposure to trauma
reminders, he would enter an unresponsive, hyper-aroused, dissociated state. He often missed
workdays after a triggered ﬂashback and lost several jobs due to absenteeism. He remained severely
symptomatic despite 20 years of antidepressant, antipsychotic, antiadrenergic (prazosin) and mood
stabilizer pharmacotherapy and cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy. The patient met all the criteria for
enrollment in our clinical trial [10], and he gave his informed consent for inclusion before participating
in the study. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the protocol
was approved by the institutional review board of the Greater Los Angeles VA Healthcare System
(IRB approval code is PCC#2016-040351).
2.2. Targeting
The patient underwent a stereotactic 3T MRI with gadolinium. The images were re-oriented
along the anterior commissure/posterior commissure (AC/PC) in our planning software
(FHC, Bowdoin, ME, USA). Targeting the BLn is complicated due to anatomical variations in this
region. Using a stereotactic atlas [13], the inferior limit of the BLn is located 16 mm lateral to the AC,
4 mm posterior to the AC and 18 mm inferior to the AC-PC plane. However, these coordinates would

261

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 28

be incorrect for a large number of patients, and targeting has to be performed based on the local
mesiotemporal anatomy.
The BLn is located in the inferior portion of the amygdala. It is at the center of the amygdala
where it is ﬂanked laterally by the lateral nucleus and medially by the basomedial and basolateral
ventromedial part [14]. The central and medial nuclei of the amygdala are dorsal to the BLn. When the
MRI is oriented along the AC-PC plane, the fornices can be seen crossing the hypothalamus in the
same coronal plane as the BLn within the amygdala [14]. Within this coronal plane, the BLn is located
in the center of the amygdala from a medial-to-lateral perspective. When studying the axial plane at
this level, the BLn is located just anterior to the tip of the temporal horn, which thus serves as another
important landmark [11]. Finally, the inferior border of the BLn is marked by the presence of the head
of the hippocampus (Figure 1).

Figure 1. The ﬁgure shows the anatomical position of the BLn electrodes in the coronal plane (A,C,D)
and sagittal plane (B): (A) The electrode must avoid the superior extent of the ambient cistern (arrow);
(B) and the lenticulostriate vessels (arrowhead); (C,D) respectively show the right and left Bln electrodes
with segmentation of the nuclei: in yellow, the central nucleus; in red, the basolateral nucleus; in blue,
the lateral nucleus and, in white, the head of the hippocampus. The electrode contact distribution,
from dorsal to ventral: Central nucleus (one contact); BLn (two contacts); Hippocampus (one contact).
Laterally: Lateral nucleus (zero contacts).

The electrode trajectory must avoid critical structures to permit a safe transfrontal approach.
It should be posterior to the lenticulostriate perforator vessels from the ﬁrst segment of the middle
cerebral artery and it should remain lateral to the superior aspect of the ambient cistern (Figure 1).
Finally, the trajectory should be seen traversing just anterior to the tip of the temporal horn to conﬁrm
the location within the BLn [11]. The location of the entry point will vary depending on the anatomy
of the critical structures. In general, it will have a lateral angle of 0–10˝ from midline and an anterior
angle of 70–80˝ from the AC-PC plane.
2.3. Anesthesia and Microelectrode Recording
Induction was performed with fentanyl and propofol. Subsequently, the patient received
sevoﬂurane until the burr holes were completed. At that point, sevoﬂurane was stopped, the patient

262

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 28

was awakened and the laryngeal mask was removed. The microelectrode recording (MER) was
started on the right side, once the patient had fully regained consciousness, using a platinum-iridium
differential electrode (DZAP, FHC). The patient received fentanyl (100 mcg) and midazolam (1 mg)
during the right MER and he received fentanyl (50 mcg) and midazolam (1 mg) during the left MER.
This medication was administered in order to assist the patient with symptoms of pain and anxiety
that became clinically signiﬁcant as the patient emerged from anesthesia.
The MER was started 20 mm above the target. The microelectrodes were advanced and the signal
output was recorded for 30 s at 0.5 mm increments. The unit signals were sampled at 48,000 Hz and
were recorded with low- and high-frequency cutoffs of 500 and 5000 Hz, respectively. The spike counts
were calculated with a spike threshold set at 150 μvolt (MATLAB, MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA).
The spike detection algorithm follows a few rules for automatic spike detection. It only detected
spikes in unilateral direction (on the upward deﬂection) when the signal data point reaches above
the threshold of 150 μvolt. It requires the signal data point to decrease below 150 μvolt before a new
spike is counted. This algorithm biased toward a low estimate of the actual spike generated because in
scenario that multiple discharging units were overlapping one after the other and the waveform stayed
above the threshold, the multiple spikes were counted as the same spike. However, this algorithm
could avoid a bigger bias by counting every data point above the threshold as a new spike. Spikes were
counted per second over the 30 s period, and the mean and standard deviation (n = 30) of spike
frequency was calculated per recording site.
2.4. EEG Recording
The EEG recording was performed using a clinical EEG machine (Nihon Kohden, Irvine, CA, USA).
The electrodes were placed according to the standard international 10–20 system. The EEG tracings
were displayed using a double-banana montage. The EEG was studied using conventional clinical
analysis techniques.
2.5. Sleep and Nightmares Recording
The most distressing PTSD symptom reported by our patient was the occurrence of severe
nightmares. Given the clinical relevance of those episodes for our subject, we elected to measure
the impact of BLn DBS on sleep and nightmares. Upon enrollment, he was given a table on which
he recorded the hours that he slept every night as well as the number and the subjective intensity
(0 none, 10 most severe) of these nightmares. This method of measurement is inherently qualitative,
subjective and non-validated. Our aim was to obtain a preliminary sense of the impact of our treatment
on subjective sleep experience.
3. Results
3.1. Microelectrode and DBS Lead Positions
The positions of the DBS leads were conﬁrmed using a stereotactic CT scan fused to the
preoperative MRI using our planning software (WayPoint, FHC, Bowdoin, ME, USA). The location of
microelectrode recordings in relation to the anatomy was extrapolated based on a stereotactic atlas [14],
while taking into account the local anatomy and the AC-PC coordinates at each MER recording point.
3.2. Microelectrode Recording
The MER data correlated to the anatomy as predicted by a stereotactic atlas (Figure 2). The initial
high-frequency signal was in the position of the ventral globus pallidus externa (GPe) (49 ˘ 17 Hz
on the left and 114 ˘ 84 Hz on the right). This signal was followed by an area sparse in spikes in the
region of the ventroamygdalofugal pathway dorsal to the amygdala. The entry into the amygdala was
characterized by an increase in ﬁring frequency in the region of the central nucleus of the amygdala
CeA (2 ˘ 3 Hz on the left and 20 ˘ 18 Hz on the right). The BLn was characterized by a similar

263

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 28

neuronal ﬁring frequency as the CeA. The dorsal BLn showed 3 ˘ 3 Hz on the left and 29 ˘ 19 Hz on
the right. The ventral BLn had a spike frequency of 12 ˘ 13 Hz and 33 ˘ 30 Hz on the left and right,
respectively. The ventral exit from the BLn was characterized with a drop of spikes and background
activity consistent with white matter in the region separating the BLn from the hippocampus. The entry
into the hippocampus was characterized by high-frequency activity on the right (85 ˘ 53 Hz), but not
on the left (2 ˘ 4 Hz). Overall, the frequency was higher in the right hemisphere compared to the left.

Figure 2. MER signals at different sites along the trajectory of the microelectrode. The predicted
trajectory has been superimposed to a stereotactic brain atlas [14]. The MERs match the predicted
anatomy with higher frequencies noted in the GPe, the amygdala and the hippocampus. The right side
shows a higher frequency than the left side. The entrance and the exit from the amygdala are marked
by a drop in background activity.

3.3. Intraoperative Neurostimulation
The patient was awake and able to correspond with the psychiatry team during testing of DBS
electrode contacts. The intra-operative neurostimulation was conducted using the implant DBS
electrode (3387, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA). The DBS electrodes were connected to an external
neurostimulator (37022, Medtronic, USA) using an alligator clip wire (3550-67, Medtronic, USA) that
allows for each contact to be activated individually. For each electrode contact, we used the following
stimulation parameters: 120 μs of pulse width, 160 Hz of frequency and an amplitude of 0–5 V
increased by increments of 0.5 V. The activation of the contacts located in the BLn triggered memories
of places he had been, mainly in his childhood. Some of the scenes were experienced as if from a
distance. These were generally experienced as pleasant or amusing. He also experienced emotions
of calm. Since his diagnosis of PTSD, he had not had pleasant memories and this represented a new
experience for him. The only unpleasant experience was a transient subjective sensation that he could
not picture the examiner’s face when he closed his eyes, despite accurate recognition by looking at
the examiner in person or on an identiﬁcation card. There were no other adverse events related to the
stimulation at amplitudes up to 5 V. Electrical stimulation of the mesiotemporal structures has led to
similar experiences in epilepsy patients [15].
3.4. Post-Operative Electroencephalogram
The patient underwent surveillance of a 30 min EEG at baseline and then monthly post-operatively.
The predominant muscle artifacts that were noted in awake recordings attenuated signiﬁcantly after
264

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 28

DBS stimulation. The persistent ﬁnding of being able to relax his frontalis muscles suggests that the
patient was less anxious or hypervigilant. Over time, the EEG has demonstrated a reduction in the
frequency of the posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) from 11 Hz to 9 Hz. Furthermore, the EEG showed
progressively more sleep patterns and, by month 10, slow wave sleep was observed on all subsequent
EEG studies (Figure 3). The patient reported improved duration and quality of sleep during the same
interval. In particular, he reported an average gain of three hours of sleep and a marked reduction in
nightmare frequency and severity (Figure 4). These nightmares were reported to the study team and
many previous psychiatrists as horrifying re-experiences of combat events that woke him from sleep
in an autonomically hyper-aroused state. For years he would get out of bed after these nightmares and
stand in a cold shower for an hour or more, trying to “wash off” the residue of charred ﬂesh he had
experienced enveloping him during the nightmare. Upon enrollment in the study, given that this was
the patient’s most distressing PTSD symptom, he was given a recording sheet on which he recorded
the number and subjective (0 none, 10 most severe) intensity of these nightmares. As shown in Figure 4,
these experiences have decreased in frequency and severity with DBS, and have not recurred as of the
time of this writing (18 months after initiation of DBS).

Figure 3. EEG at baseline and one year post-operatively. At baseline, the EEG shows robust PDR and
muscle artifacts in the frontal channels, possibly related to anxiety. At one year post-operatively, the EEG
shows a reduction in PDR and the presence of SWS, which may reﬂect a reduction in anxiety. Double
Banana montage and a bandwidth of 1–70 Hz were used for displaying EEG tracings. Tracings from
the right hemisphere were color-coded as red, and left hemisphere as blue, and sagittal line as black.
The tracings from top to bottom in sequence were: Fp 2-F8, F8-T4, T4-T6, T6-O2, Fp 1-F7, F7-T3, T3-T5,
T5-O1, Fp 2-F4, F4-C4, C4-P4, P4-O2, Fp 1-F3, F3-C3, C3-P3, P3-O1, Fz-Cz, Cz-Oz. One channel EKG
tracing, which was in red color, was shown at the bottom.

4. Discussion
BLn DBS may prove beneﬁcial for psychiatric conditions characterized by the failure to extinguish
the link between an emotion (fear, pleasure) and a stimulus. Thus far, our patient has shown a
substantial clinical improvement [16]. This is the second reported case of BLn DBS [11]. In both
cases, a transfrontal trajectory was safely employed. This approach allows for a DBS lead placement
that spans the CeA, the BLn, and the head of the hippocampus. These structures are interconnected
and have been implicated in PTSD. The transfrontal approach therefore allows us to modulate more
than one target nucleus depending on the clinical response. In addition, this trajectory avoids the
ventricle and the body of the hippocampus, both of which would be entered during a transoccipital
approach. Finally, the transfrontal approach is comfortable for the patient and it permits a safe and
tolerable subdermal implantation of the leads. A transtemporal approach would require dividing
the temporalis muscle, thus causing pain and possibly interfering with subcutaneous tunneling.
The neurostimulation in this acute setting triggered memories of childhood; this experience has been
reported with mesiotemporal electrical stimulation in epilepsy patients [15] and may prove predictive
of proper electrode placement.
The MER ﬁndings were concordant with the anatomy as predicted by a stereotactic atlas. There is
a relative paucity of neuronal spikes at the dorsal and the ventral extent of the BLn corresponding
to white matter tracts at the margins of the nucleus. MER may predict the trajectory and span of
the lead within the BLn. Our MER data also suggested more neuronal spikes in the right subcortical
structures compared to the left. Several factors could account for this discrepancy. For instance,
differences in anesthesia may account for this ﬁnding, although efforts were made to maintain the
level of consciousness and the medication administered as constant during the right and the left
MERs. Nevertheless, a benzodiazepine and a narcotic agent had to be administered to help the patient
with pain and anxiety which became signiﬁcant as the anesthesia was lifted. Other factors could
also explain some of the differences between the right and left MER recordings. The trajectories may
have been slightly different and the left electrode may have passed through a region with relative
paucity in neurons compared to the right side. Alternatively, our MER ﬁndings may represent an
overall increase in neuronal activity in the right hemisphere and the right amygdala in the context of
PTSD. Other authors have reported hemispheric laterality ﬁndings in PTSD. Using resting-state
magnetoenceopahlography (MEG), Engdahl et al. [17] showed that PTSD patients have more
synchronous neuronal interactions in the right hemisphere compared to normal controls or PTSD
patients in remission. Using a SPECT scan, Pagani et al. [18] showed an increase in right hemisphere
cerebral blood ﬂow when PTSD patients were exposed to a traumatic reminder compared to normal
controls. Our ability to draw any conclusions in regard to this right and left discrepancy in MERs is
limited by the fact that we have data for only one subject thus far.
The EEG ﬁndings of reduced PDR frequency and increased presence of sleep may reﬂect an effect
of BLn DBS on anxiety. The PDR frequency has been reported to be higher in anxious patients compared
to normal controls [19]. This effect on the PDR can serve as a proxy for anxiety whether it is directly
related to anxiety or related to the patient’s inability to achieve a relaxed state [20]. Clinically, DBS of
the amygdala reduced hyper-arousal symptoms and the underlying anxiety associated with PTSD.
This effect may translate into an overall reduction in PDR and the appearance of slow-wave sleep SWS
on the EEG since the patient is less anxious and is able to fall asleep easily. During the same interval,
the patient reported a subjective improvement in duration and quality of sleep. By reducing anxiety,
DBS may permit the activation of amygdala circuits critical to sleep. Anxiety can be understood
as the psychological percept associated with the inability to activate those sleep circuits due to
amygdala-mediated hypervigilance.
5. Conclusions
We describe our targeting technique and intraoperative ﬁndings for the placement of BLn DBS
electrodes. BLn DBS may prove beneﬁcial in conditions where emotional regulation mechanisms are
266

Brain Sci. 2016, 6, 28

dysfunctional, leading to a pervasive state of emotional inﬂexibility. In severe PTSD, failure of fear
extinction causes a generalized association of fear to benign stimuli. In substance abuse, dysfunction
in pleasure control leads to a preoccupation with drug-seeking behavior due to a failure of reward
extinction. We describe MER ﬁndings for a patient with severe PTSD. The MER data may predict the
span of the DBS lead within the BLn. Furthermore, the increase in spike frequency can be explained by
the increase in metabolism and cerebral blood ﬂow seen in PTSD patients. On EEG, chronic BLn DBS
was associated with an overall reduction in the PDR frequency and the presence of SWS. These ﬁndings
may highlight a reduction in anxiety. Nevertheless, our study is limited to a single subject. In addition,
MER in the clinical setting does not clearly distinguish the type and the exact number of neurons being
recorded, limiting our analytic capability.
