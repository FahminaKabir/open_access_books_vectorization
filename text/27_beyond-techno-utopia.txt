Preface
The title for this special issue was devised as a direct challenge to the prevailing solutionist and
instrumental approaches to the application of digital technologies to medicine and public health.
In formulating the idea and title for the special issue, I wanted to inspire some provocative and
challenging commentary and research on what I interpreted as a dominantly techno-utopian position on
digital health. One important approach that I particularly wanted to encourage, and which I articulate
in my own contribution to the special issue, is that which views digital health technologies as social,
cultural and material artefacts which have political implications and embodied entanglements with
humans and other nonhuman actors.
Three waves of digital technology adoption have been identified in healthcare. The first wave began
in the 1950s, when nascent computerised technologies were used to automate standardised and
repetitive tasks such as accounting and payroll-related data entry. Health insurance companies and
other industry stakeholders also used computers to analyse data. The second wave of digital
technology use in healthcare emerged in the 1970s, incorporating the development of health
informatics and electronic health card systems. Both waves incorporated individual institutions
establishing systems for more efficient data management and processing. The third wave is emerging
in the current era. This wave sees moves towards the digitisation of as many elements of healthcare as
possible and the interaction and exchange of data between different institutions and systems: an
overarching framework that incorporates data not only from healthcare institutions and systems but
actors and agencies outside this sector [1].
Over the past few years, an emerging discourse on digital health technologies (also referred to as
mHealth, eHealth, connected health and Health 2.0) has represented them as offering unprecedented
solutions to the “wicked problems” of medicine and public health. In popular forums, among digital
developers and entrepreneurs and in the medical and public health literature a constant refrain has
insisted on the “disruptive” and “revolutionary” nature of these technologies and their potential to
address budgetary constraints and healthcare delivery limitations and to facilitate health promotion,
preventive medicine and public health surveillance. Digital health technologies encompass a wide
range of devices and software. These include the use of social media by both members of the lay
public and healthcare or public health professionals to discuss health and medical issues and
disseminate information; remote healthcare consultations and patient self-care using digital
technologies (telemedicine and telehealth); the use of virtual reality in medical training; the rapidly
expanding number of mobile applications (“apps”) devoted to health and medical matters (now
numbering in the tens of thousands); health informatics systems in healthcare delivery; public health
surveillance using big data to track disease patterns; wearable self-tracking devices and gaming
technologies for monitoring bodily functions and activities using sensors; health promotion employing
social media and text messages; 3D printing of medical devices and prosthetics; and community
development and activist initiatives involving citizen science/citizen sensor activities to generate
environmental information on their local area (see overviews in [2,3]).

X
Digital health technologies and the medical gaze extend well beyond the clinic. They now penetrate
into many social domains and intersect with a multitude of objectives and purposes. It is clear that
health monitoring technologies and the personal data that they generate are viewed as significant
commercial opportunities for digital developers. Major companies such as Apple, Samsung, Microsoft
and Google are now entering the digital health arena: all four announced their plans to launch health
and fitness tracking platforms in 2014. Healthcare, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are
using social and other digital media for marketing and public relations purposes. This takes place in a
variety of ways, from the traditional explicit type of marketing, such as sponsoring banner ads and
conferences, to the covert, such as attempting to influence social media discussions on platforms such
as Facebook or Twitter. The collection of personal data by self-tracking devices has been taken up
and repurposed by employers, educational institutions, health and life insurance and customer loyalty
programs [4]. These technologies bring voluntary individual health-related behaviours (such as a lay
person choosing to download a health-related app) or communal sharing of experiences (as in patient
support platforms such as PatientsLikeMe) together with the imposed or “pushed” use of devices (for
instance patients being sent home from hospital with wireless self-monitoring technologies) and the
use of people’s personal digital data by actors and agencies for their own managerial or commercial
purposes, often without people’s knowledge or consent (for example the “harvesting” of social media
content by biopharmaceutical companies) [4].
While there is an extensive literature on older forms of digital technologies that have been used for
health and medical purposes (such as blogs, websites and telemedicine), academic researchers,
particularly in the social sciences, have yet to devote much attention to the newer technologies that
have emerged over the past half-decade or so: apps, wearable and citizen sensing devices and 3D
printing, for example. Most of the publications that have appeared on these topics have been published
in the medical and public health literature. The writers take a largely instrumental approach that is
interested in the efficacy of digital technologies or professional issues such as accuracy of the
information provided or conflict of interest concerns. For example a recent meta-analysis of the
literature that has been published investigating social media use in medicine and healthcare found
evidence of the growing use of social media in these sectors. The authors identified across these
publications recurrent themes related to ethics, professionalism, privacy, confidentiality and
information quality [5].
The available information on the usage statistics of digital technologies mostly comes from market
research, although the Pew Internet Center has also conducted valuable surveys on the American
population. A 2013 Pew report noted that 59 per cent of American adults said that they had searched
online for health-related information, with over one-third of their respondents reporting using the
internet to self-diagnose or diagnose someone else’s condition [6]. Recent market research surveys
have found that more than a third of American doctors had recommended that their patients use a
health or medical app and that almost one-third of American smartphone owners had used health and
fitness apps [7]. However, while a great deal of hype and excitement have been expressed about the
possibilities and potential of digital health in entrepreneurial digital developer circles and news reports,
the reality of use does not always reach expectations. For example other market research has found
that while in 2013 one in ten American adults owned a digital fitness tracker, a high proportion of

XI
people (more than half) had relinquished their use; one third had given up using it within six months of
purchase [8].
The articles in this special issue build on a well-established literature in sociology, science and
technology studies and media and cultural studies that has addressed the use of digital technologies in
health and medicine. This research has particularly focused on patients’ and healthcare professionals’
experiences of telemedicine and telehealth, lay people’s use of websites and social media for seeking
information about health and medical topics and sharing experiences of specific conditions, the
inequalities that are evident in different social groups’ use of digital technologies for health- and
medical-related purposes and the sociocultural dimensions of the digitising of human bodies (see [2]
for a review of this literature). Studies on patients’ experiences of using digital technologies for
at-home self-care, for example, have demonstrated the complexities, ambivalences and strong
emotions that are involved. Patients may find using these devices empowering, allowing them to
reduce travel to see their healthcare provider or to live independently at home. However, many patients
resent the incursion into their homes of medical devices that constantly remind them that they are old
and infirm or are dealing with a serious chronic illness, or make them feel that they are under constant
surveillance. Furthermore, while the devices promise certainty and simplicity, they are often difficult
to use and ambiguous in the information they convey [9–13].
Several of these topics are taken up in the articles published in this special issue. All the authors use
social and cultural theory to provide insights into the tacit assumptions, cultural meanings and
experiences of digital health technologies. The articles cover a range of digital health technologies:
devices used for the self-tracking of body metrics (Ruckenstein; Till; Rich and Miah; Lupton); social
media platforms for discussing patients’ experiences of chronic disease (Sosnowy) and experiences of
pregnancy and early motherhood (Johnson); health and medical apps (Till; Johnson; Christie and
Verran; Lupton); telehealthcare systems (Hendy, Chrysanthaki and Barlow); and a digital public health
surveillance system (Cakici and Sanches). While some articles focus on globalised digital media
(Cakici and Sanches; Rich and Miah; Till; Lupton), others engage more specifically with a range of
sociocultural groups, contexts and locations. These include Aboriginal people living in a remote region
of Australia (Christie and Verran) and Australian mothers in urban Sydney (Johnson) as well as
research participants in Helsinki, Finland (Ruckenstein), the United States (Sosnowy) and England
(Hendy, Chrysanthaki and Barlow).
Understandings and experiences of selfhood and embodiment as they are generated and experienced
via digital health devices are central preoccupations in the articles by Ruckenstein, Rich and Miah,
Till, Lupton, Sosnowy and Johnson. Ruckenstein’s study of self-trackers found that they often
conceptualised their bodies and their physical activities in different ways when these were being
monitored and rendered into digital data. The data that were generated by these devices proved to be
motivational and to give value to some activities (like housework) that otherwise lacked value or new
meaning to functions such as sleep (which when digitised and quantified became viewed as a
competence). Ruckenstein found that the digital data tended to be invested with greater validity than
were other indicators of bodily wellbeing or activity, such as the individual’s physical sensations.
All of the above authors comment on the ways in which digital health devices such as wearable
self-tracking devices, social media platforms, apps and patient support websites work as disciplinary
tools. They invite users to conform to the ideals of healthism (privileging good health above other

XII
priorities) and the responsible self-management and self-monitoring of one’s health and body,
including avoiding exposure to risk. Rich and Miah use the concept of “public pedagogy” to describe
the socio-political dimensions of digital health technologies as they are employed to educate people
about their bodies and promote self-management. As Johnson notes, for women who are pregnant or
have the care of young children, this sphere of responsibility is extended to the bodies of others: the
foetus or child. And as Till’s article emphasises, when employees are “encouraged” to engage in
self-tracking, the ethos of responsibility extends from personal objectives to those of employers.
Ruckenstein, Till and Sosnowy also highlight the digital labour involved for people who engage
with social media or self-tracking apps as part of their personal health or fitness practices. Sosnowy’s
interviews with women with multiple sclerosis who blog about their condition emphasise the work
involved in such engagement as an “active patient”. Till’s analysis of digital exercise self-tracking,
points to the appropriations of people’s labour by other actors for commercial reasons.
The article by Hendy, Chrysanthaki and Barlow moves in a somewhat different direction. Using
ethnographic cases studies, they look at the managerial issues involved with implementing
telehealthcare in English social and health care organisations. Their focus, therefore, is not on the
recipients or targets of digital health technologies but rather those who are attempting to institute
programs as part of their work as managers. These authors’ contribution highlights the messiness of
introducing new systems and practices into large organisations, and the resistances that may emerge on
the part of both workers and the targets of telehealthcare programs. Cakici and Sanches’ article also
takes an organisational perspective in addressing a European Commission co-funded project directed
at syndromic surveillance, or the use of secondary sources to detect outbreaks and patterns in diseases
and medical conditions. Digital data are increasingly being use as part of syndromic surveillance:
Google Flu Trends is one such example. Cakici and Sanches’ analysis highlights the role played by
human decision-making and the affordances of digital technologies in structuring what kinds of data
are retrieved for syndromic surveillance and how they are interpreted.
While there are as yet few detailed ethnographic accounts of how people are implementing,
adopting or resisting contemporary digital health technologies, there are even fewer that investigate the
use of these technologies by members of cultural groups outside the global North. The article by
Christie and Verran takes a much-needed diversion from perspectives on white, privileged groups to
Aboriginal people living in a remote part of Australia. As they argue, the concepts on health, illness
and the body that are held by this cultural group differ radically from the tacit assumptions that are
invested in mainstream health and medical apps. Any app that is developed to assist in health literacy
that is targeted at this group must incorporate culturally-appropriate modes of communication:
positioning people within their cultural and kinship networks of sociality, for example, rather than
representing them as atomised actors.
The articles collected here in this special issue have gone some way in offering a critical response to
digital health technologies, but they represent only a beginning. Many more compelling topics remain
to be investigated. These include research into the ways in which lay people and healthcare
professionals are using (or resisting the use) of social media, apps and self-monitoring devices for
medicine and health-related purposes; the implications for medical power and the doctor-patient
relationship; how citizen science and citizen sensing are operating in the public health domain; the
development of new digital health technologies; the implications of big data and data harvesting in

XIII
medicine and healthcare; the spreading out of health-related self-tracking practices into many social
domains; the unintended consequences and ethical aspects of digital technology use and their
implications for social justice; and data security and privacy issues.

Visualized and Interacted Life: Personal Analytics and
Engagements with Data Doubles
Minna Ruckenstein
Abstract: A field of personal analytics has emerged around self-monitoring practices, which
includes the visualization and interpretation of the data produced. This paper explores personal
analytics from the perspective of self-optimization, arguing that the ways in which people confront
and engage with visualized personal data are as significant as the technology itself. The paper leans
on the concept of the “data double”: the conversion of human bodies and minds into data flows that
can be figuratively reassembled for the purposes of personal reflection and interaction. Based on an
empirical study focusing on heart-rate variability measurement, the discussion underlines that a
distanced theorizing of personal analytics is not sufficient if one wants to capture affective
encounters between humans and their data doubles. Research outcomes suggest that these
explanations can produce permanence and stability while also profoundly changing ways in which
people reflect on themselves, on others and on their daily lives.

1. Introduction
With smart phones and tracking devices, measuring and tracing aspects of “the personal” and
“the everyday” is becoming more commonplace. A field of personal analytics has emerged around
self-monitoring practices such as the measuring and tracking of physiological reactions, movement,
and activities of individuals; the sharing of the data with others; and the interpretation of data
produced [1–3]. This article approaches personal analytics through two interrelated themes that
have been identified as formative in this field: visibility and self-optimization [3–7]. Self-monitoring
is a practice that seeks to make known something that is typically not a subject of reflection, with
the aim of converting previously undetected bodily reactions and behavioural clues into traceable
and perceptible information. Consequently, the design and technical specifications of tracking
technology builds on the notion that visibility is desirable and that it is of value for people to have
their physiologies and everyday movements made observable and legible.
The theme of visibility links personal analytics to modern notions of control and
governmentality, the idea being that by making unknown aspects of bodies and lives detectable, we
can gain more control over life processes and entities [4,7,8]. From this perspective, personal
analytics is part of the history of conquering previously unexplored areas by making physiological
responses and behavior—heartbeat, everyday movements, the number of steps taken and so
on—available for mapping and tracking. Smartphone applications and other monitoring devices act
as mediators and translators that contribute to opening a widening field of everyday life to scrutiny
and intervention, connecting with the theme of self-optimization. Personal analytics is thus firmly
rooted in the externalization of “nature” as something that people are able to transform: when

2
bodies and lives are made more transparent, they can be better acknowledged and acted upon. With
the aid of digital technology, particularly the tracking and monitoring of the self, optimization
becomes not only possible, but also desirable. It is not enough to have a more transparent view of
oneself, one needs to respond to that knowledge and raise one’s goals, thereby framing the
“natural” body as incomplete, as failing the demands and potentials of the information age [7].
With new data streams, the body may be increasingly controlled by reason; it can be transformed
and improved in order to attain happiness and excellence. As Viseu and Suchman [7] (p. 163)
argue: “the greater visibility of bodily information implies an associated responsibility to act”.
The following discussion is shaped by these defining themes but, rather than reifying them, the
aim is to explore how they are played out in relation to personal analytics. Both visibility and
self-optimization are regarded as active processes and desires rather than static qualities of
presence or absence. It is suggested that in order to engage with these processes in a more detailed
and reflexive manner, it is crucial to understand how people confront and interact with their own
data. I rely on the concept of “data double” [5] (p. 237); [9] (p. 606) previously discussed in the
field of surveillance studies. Haggerty and Ericson [9] refer to operations that first abstract human
bodies by separating them into various data flows or streams and then reassemble them into data
doubles to be analyzed and targeted for intervention. The aim here is to illustrate that by promoting
processes that abstract and slice “the self” into various kinds of data flows, self-monitoring enables
the making of personal data doubles. Technologies offer partial vistas of people’s lives in the form
of data doubles that become part of processes of knowledge formation; data doubles are ways of
knowing that can be reflected on and used for various purposes.
The article presents, via an empirical self-monitoring study which produced data generated by
heart-rate variability measurement, some characteristics and potentials of people’s engagements
with data doubles in order to emphasize the active, but also partial, nature of visibility and
self-optimization. The study offers observations of how people understand and react to personal
data and find value in it. By bringing to the fore ways in which people want to make use of their
data doubles the discussion underlines the fact that a detached theorizing of personal analytics is
not enough if one wants to capture more affective and wishful ways in which people become
involved with their data. People undertake personal analytics as data emerge; while being shaped
by self-tracking technologies, they also, in turn, shape them by their own ideas and practices. Data
doubles operate as triggers for intervention, as shared artifacts for co-constructing and negotiating
meaning: mediators that guide behavior and stimulate discussions and negotiations around personal
analytics. From this perspective, digital devices and the data that they generate are material to
people’s lives and a part of knowing and valuing those lives [10].
2. Engagements with Data Doubles
Not much empirical research has been conducted on everyday uses of self-monitoring.
However, with its emphasis on visibility and optimization, self-monitoring sits comfortably within
well-known Foucauldian themes [5,11]. Monitoring and tracking technologies create a “techno-gaze”
that can be directed towards the user: measuring devices offer insights into personal data flows by
making them comprehensible and actionable in terms of individual and biopolitical aims. In other

3
words, tracking devices offer and arrange physical and metaphysical information by encouraging
and persuading the measured to engage with it. Useful here is also the concept of governmentality,
and associated technologies of the self, that explain processes that aim to auto-regulate and
auto-correct selves through various kinds of therapeutic and health-related techniques [11] (p. 46).
In the area of personal analytics, processes of governmentality become observable as mundane
attempts to auto-correct bodies, minds and everyday doings. Less than representing a desire to be
surveyed and disciplined by an outside force, personal analytics are aimed at detecting likely
occurrences of diseases, anomalies or deviant behavior. The more strongly emphasized the moral
imperative of healthiness, the more people feel they need to pursue it [12]. Thus, the aim is to
minimize unhealthy and deviant behavior and maximize healthy behavior.
An important arena for observing these kinds of auto-regulative processes of everyday
governmentality is the Quantified Self movement that started in California in 2008 [1,13]. Wired
magazine, one of the main advocates of the QS movement, has openly promoted self-optimization
and “living by numbers” [14]. The theme of optimization has become an important element of the
QS movement via maintaining an optimistic and solution oriented quality to the discourse on
personal analytics. Typical of the QS activists’ experiments is that they collect data for analysis
with their smartphones and via other measurement techniques and devices, then present the data in
QS meetings and online. Personal data and insights gained on “the self” are discussed and
circulated so that others can learn from them and perform similar experiments. Significant is the
fact that the participants of the QS movement are mostly healthy; they are trying to “optimize their
healthiness” by making their bodies and minds more legible through measurement data.
The search for visibility and self-optimization suggests that by applying Foucauldian themes to
personal analytics we gain a relatively sound description of what self-monitoring does. Most avid
self-trackers have not only internalized the desire to know and to optimize, but also voluntarily act
on it by sharing information about their tracking experiments and experiences with their friends
and followers, who are invited to monitor their bodily habits and mental states in similar ways.
More detailed inquiries into personal analytics and the QS movement, however, also indicate other
directions worth exploring. While people distribute, share and compare their data, the notion of
personal analytics promotes numerous ways of relating to data, others and selves [5,13]. Thus, it is
worthwhile to treat personal analytics as an emerging field of interactions that consists of various
kinds of practices and purposes. The Quantified Self movement might appear to be straightforward
group self-optimization (or self-optimization in groups), but it is in fact an important site for
questioning the meaning and value of self-monitoring devices and related data flows [13].
In order to attend to additional routes in exploring personal analytics, the aim here is to open for
scrutiny ways in which data flows might participate in processes of knowledge formation. I have
suggested that self-tracking tools abstract human bodies and minds into data flows that can be used
and reflected upon. Data doubles are decorporealized and decontextualized bodies—hybrid
composites of information—in ways that are intended to encourage people to act in certain
ways [5] (p. 237). Importantly, however, recontextualized data doubles might also argue against,
ignore, or bypass normative notions of auto-correcting and transforming selves. For instance,
anorectics participating in pro-ana online communities share weight-loss tips and offer “thinspiration”

4
to involve and encourage others in body projects [15,16] which can take advantage of various
forms of self-tracking, including self-monitoring devices, in order to be achieved.
Active relationships with personal data underline the fact that personal analytics is emergent and
unstable in its goals, characterized by diffuse processes of power that spread over many kinds of
networks. This paper offers one possible window onto these processes by demonstrating that
people are not only gathering and reflecting on the data, but harnessing it to personal and collective
value projects. While interaction and negotiation with data doubles open new kinds of personal
vistas, research has demonstrated that personal analytics also creates opportunities for animating
the world in ways that are not so obvious. Following Thrift [17] (p. 22), data production through
self-tracking can also “frame the world in new ways which deliver a kind of structured uncertainty
from which it is possible to detect new things”. As they contemplate the value they supply to the
curves depicting physiological reactions to various stimuli, people learn “things” of which they
may have been previously unaware. Rather than seeing the person engaging with the data as a
bounded entity with a stable and fixed ontology, it might be instructive to appreciate him/her as in
a constant state of movement towards becoming, directed by a desire to detect and form new
alliances or entities.
3. Motivations for Measuring Life
The empirical part of the article is based on a research project conducted at the National
Consumer Research Centre in Helsinki (a collaborative effort by Mika Pantzar, Veera Mustonen
and Minna Ruckenstein). In spring 2012, we collected, in co-operation with VTT Technical
Research Centre of Finland, an extensive body of material composed of both quantitative and
qualitative self-tracking data. From the perspective of personal analytics, aggregated data can be
used to identify bodily reactions and behavioural regularities, while the qualitative data might, for
instance, describe the ways people experience and give meaning to measured elements in daily
life [18]. With their own questions and insights, research participants can deepen the correlations
found in numerical data and provide bases for an understanding of what measurement data
represents and does to people. Out of the large body of data, this discussion particularly focuses on
the gathering of the qualitative elements. The aim is to describe what the data gathering process can
teach us about personal analytics as an object of study and a field of interactions.
Data collection was supported by Finnish technology companies Vivago and Firstbeat who
provided equipment that included a wrist watch measuring activity levels (Vivago), and a heart-rate
variability monitor in the form of two electrodes taped on to the skin of the chest (Firstbeat).
Evidently, by using marketed tracking devices in our research design, we too became part of the
self-tracking market. From this perspective, our research takes place within a collaborative
economy wherein market agents promote research that takes advantage of their devices in order to
gain legitimacy and reinforce the credibility and reliability of their offerings. We decided to
co-operate because we could not have realized our research otherwise. Not naming the companies
was an option we considered, but we felt that it was important in terms of our research results to
make known our collaborators. The association with technology companies means that this study
has an inbuilt tension that cannot be resolved; we could only deal with it by being reflexive and

5
open-minded about the goals of our research. This research stance was an intentional
counterbalance to the device market that tends to represent personal analytics in a programmatic
and decontextualized manner: as a solution rather than a starting point. Conversely, we were
curious to observe what is actually being promoted by confronting people with digital devices and
the data they generate.
Much of the output of self-monitoring devices and mobile health applications, including the data
that they generate, fails to engage people [19]. Therefore, one cannot take for granted that the data
flows produced by health and wellness devices and applications are of interest to their users. For
our research participants the data generated by the Firstbeat device turned out to be most
rewarding, despite the fact that they had no access to their recorded data during the measurement
period. Some research participants did, however, comment on the fact that we used “old-fashioned
equipment”, because many of the self-tracking technologies currently available generate real-time
data and monitor the individual in the everyday as it unfolds. Thus the Firstbeat data, based on
physiological research on autonomic nervous system function, is analyzed with a temporal delay.
Since we are not medical experts and had no access to the algorithms producing information and
visualizations on exercise and physical activity, and stress and recovery, we had to take for granted
the physiological model underlying the data analysis [20]. We made clear to our research subjects
that we were not in the position to critically evaluate the “truthfulness” or “accuracy” of the
heart-rate variability data and, therefore, our aim was to understand what happens after the data is
brought into people’s lives.
The data gathering was carried out in two parts in order that the findings from the first round
could be used for correcting and supplementing the research design of the second round. Both
rounds had twenty participants; altogether, we had 36 research subjects, four of which participated
in both rounds. All lived in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, and most were in regular employment.
Participants were required to be in good health, meaning that they had no chronic illnesses and
used no regular medication. The very first research findings cast light on the relative desirability of
becoming a contributor in a self-tracking experiment. We learned that people with a systematic
and disciplined relationship to sports and exercise, or an interest in monitoring technologies, are
particularly drawn to this type of research; one third of our research participants were active in
their chosen sports at least four times a week. Indeed, we had to deliberately restrict the number of
active athletes in order to get a more heterogeneous participation. In contrast, those in poorer
physical condition, who suspected that they might be overly stressed or misusing alcohol, were
likely to decline the invitation to participate. Thus, people were keener to participate if they longed
for information, guidance, encouragement, training, and intervention, and wished to become
measured, evaluated, and challenged with data flows.
Before the study period began, an initial survey was carried out with the participants. After this,
they were interviewed both by e-mail and face to face. In addition to being instructive of people’s
interests and aims, the interviews were a way to commit the participants to the demanding data
collection process; they had to agree to carrying the research equipment with them, worn directly
on their skin, for a little over a week, day and night. The interviews proposed a plethora of
motivations for taking part in the study, highlighting the various issues that the research

6
participants thought they could learn from and solve by self-measuring. In the Northern European
context, motivation to use tracking devices is connected to discourses of public health risks which
focus on physical conditions brought about by unhealthy diet, lack of physical exercise and alcohol
consumption, and resonate at times with a notion that people who do not take care of themselves
appropriately are responsible for life-style related diseases [11] (p. 43). Some interviewees stressed
the importance of well-being in relation to society; others described in detail how they wanted to
become better athletes, spouses, parents and workers. One of the mothers, barely in her thirties,
wanted to provide an encouraging example to her children and to improve her stamina at home and
at work. She also mentioned a sense of responsibility for her own health, related to ageing, and in
relation to the welfare state.
And now that the years are piling on, I find it more important to be able to look after
myself when I’m old and not be at the mercy of others. [21]
Overall, the interviews underlined the fact that our research design resonated with questions and
expectations that people already had and that they thought that they could explore through personal
analytics. Many of the participants wanted to learn more about stress and recovery while others had
a hereditary susceptibility to hypertension or cholesterol levels that they wanted to manage better.
One of the men, in his forties, said that his father had died of a stroke relatively early, so he needed
to take the “cholesterol threat” seriously. Younger participants had suffered from burnout or
over-training and they wanted to understand how to balance their daily lives more effectively.
It became obvious that many of the research participants wanted the self-tracking period to become
a catalyst for change. For instance, a 40-year-old female professional described her expectations in
the following manner:
Of course, it will be interesting to see an outsider’s opinion of my daily routines,
especially because I know that I sometimes go against principles that I know to be
good. For example, I sometimes notice that I’m getting stressed, but the deadline is
looming. Sometimes my ambition and/or sense of duty takes precedence over my wellbeing. I expect that the study will make me observe my everyday stress-inducing
behavior in a new way—and maybe help me reduce it. [22]
Earlier research has demonstrated how visualized data appears to have agentive force [23]: it
pushes people to act and reflect. One of the women, who had recently divorced after a long
marriage and was looking for a new direction in life, believed the self-tracking study might help
her find it. She said she dreamt of having a personal trainer who would create a training program for
her and make her follow it:
I would like to get so fit that someone who hasn’t seen me for six months would say
“Wow!” to me and ask me what had happened. Because I think I would be able to do it,
but the reason it doesn’t get done is that I do nothing to get it done. [24]
These kinds of insights expose a desire to find an external motivator: self-monitoring appears to
be a method of persuasion. By using the monitoring devices, research participants not only agreed
to their bodies being deconstructed into data flows, but they expected the data flows to act on them.

7
In another example, a mother of small children, in her late twenties, who said she suffered from a
lack of exercise and a constant craving for sweets, wanted our research to help her take control of
her life. These desires are not surprising, given that self-monitoring underscores what is physiologically
valuable and worth pursuing. During our research process, we also actively tried to deconstruct
normative notions of self-monitoring by underlining the fact that certain expectations of normality,
health and self-optimization are intrinsic to tracking technologies. The idea was to offer room for
reflexivity for research participants during the data gathering (see below). Still, this normative bias
remains inbuilt in a research design that takes advantage of tracking technologies that analyze data
in order to detect normalities and abnormalities. In retrospect, the normativity of our research
design was a more pressing ethical concern for researchers than for our participants, whose
involvement had indicated that they accepted the fact that the emphasis on greater control of
individual bodies and minds was inscribed into this type of research experiment.
4. Being Monitored
Earlier studies combining qualitative and quantitative data demonstrate that data produced by
research participants have a more consistent quality if the subjects feel that they have mastered the
use of the study equipment [18]. In other words, the better the subjects control the equipment, the
less cumbersome and conspicuous it is for them. Without pronounced distance from the digital
devices or friction with them, the technology becomes less annoying, moves into the background
and might even be experienced as an extension of the self [25] 1. We wanted to ensure that none of
the participants abandoned data collection because of the equipment, and the process was explained
in detail during the joint initial meeting where the participants were given the equipment and a
promise of technical support. In addition, I kept in contact with them during the data collection
process by e-mail in order to discuss the experience of being measured. One of the participants, for
instance, described how the electrodes of the heart-rate variability device initially made her feel as
if she had just escaped from hospital. Soon, however, she got more accustomed to the measuring
apparatus and it no longer bothered her.
In terms of research methodology, online conversations are a way to involve people, because
they provide an easy and immediate way to share observations. The ongoing dialogue opens a
space for a more participatory research approach; when subjects talk about their experiences while
being monitored, they spotlight tensions and findings related to self-monitoring.
Researcher (M.R.), 22/3/2012:
Have you noticed that you pay more attention than usual to what you do and how you or your
body feel(s)? Many other participants have mentioned this. If you have noticed this, can you
give any examples?

1

See, for instance, an ethnographic study of commercially developed insulin pumps that demonstrates how the pump
allows young people to be more in charge of their diabetes; they can even forget that they have it. The pump
becomes “second nature” [25] (p. 145).

8
Participant (female, 34 years), 25/3/2012:
I haven’t managed to forget about the equipment, I’m still more alert to how my body feels than
usual. But I’ve really tried to take each day as it comes and not start “performing”.
Last night, I noticed that the measuring equipment suddenly started physically annoying me
quite a lot. I would have liked to rip it off, even if just for the night. But I stayed strong.
Not surprisingly, the monitoring equipment made people more alert to their bodily reactions and
everyday doings. When explaining their heightened awareness, they noted, for instance, the
attention they were paying to their eating, alcohol consumption, exercise and bodily sensations. In
their messages, they also played with the idea of being subjects of control and surveillance,
referring to themselves as laboratory rats or residents of the Big Brother house. Due to the nature of
our research, the research participants did not treat the surveillance that they were exposed to as a
threat to their identity or privacy, but it was an aspect that they recognized and wanted to comment
on. A similar recurrent topic was the persuasive and motivating quality of technology, linking to
the theme of self-optimization, which we discussed in the emails:
Researcher (M.R.), 24/3/2012:
We have now reached the halfway point in the monitoring period. How are you doing? Have
you noticed that you’ve changed your behavior? I’ve noticed from other responses that people
have stopped snacking so that they don’t have to write the snacks down. And they may be
keener to go jogging too. Is it the technology that motivates, or is it the fact that you are part of a
research project?
Participant (male, 35 years), 24/3/2012:
It’s going well. I don’t usually snack anyway, but I have noticed that I have not wanted to miss
any exercise. This is the thing I find interesting and would like as much information about as
possible. In other words, the technology does motivate me :) I’m intending to take a proper
fitness test at some point to find out my threshold heart rates and maximum oxygen uptake. Not
that there would be any use for this information, but it would be nice to know.
For many participants the tracking technology became a daily companion during the research
process, a silent persuader that made sure that the daily workout was not missed, and that one
walked to work instead of driving or taking public transport. After the monitoring period ended,
some people missed the equipment, regretting that they were no longer persuaded and motivated to
behave in ways they felt were right. This acceptance of self-tracking technology as a participant
and co-producer of knowledge in people’s lives highlights the desire to involve it in daily efforts to
improve their existence. Thus self-monitoring devices are often seen as benevolent and responsive,
not least because it aids people in coping with prevailing moral imperatives of being healthy and
becoming healthier [5] (p. 240). Many of our research participants expressed an interest in
continuing with self-monitoring in the future and aimed to download mobile applications for
support. They said, for instance, that they were fascinated by the ways in which combining different
data flows might deepen their bodily understanding and self-awareness. One of the participants, in his

9
late twenties, was impressed by the way in which the data could offer him practical and everyday
means to influence his life and advance his happiness. The value of real-time data in promoting
immediate response to personal choices was also mentioned.
5. Visualizing and Interpreting Life
After the monitoring period, the subjects received an illustrated report based on Firstbeat
HEALTH-software analysis (see Figure 1) of their heart-rate variation that included their own
entries about their everyday doings. With its colors, curves, and bars, the report represents stress
and recovery measurements: red indicates stress reactions, green is recovery, blue exercise, and
white something in between. The numbers in the chart refer to self-reported activities in the course
of the day, the mauve lines under the chart refer to working hours, and the blue line to sleep.
Figure 1. Firstbeat report used in data interpretation.

The physiological assumptions on which the Firstbeat summary is based rely on certain
algorithms and therefore cannot be considered absolute in any way. A physician who has studied
Firstbeat measurements provided the following instructions:
In the case of people who do creative work, experts, managers, etc., it is essential that a
high activity level (work flow) be distinguishable from harmful stress. Both often show
as red, for almost all waking hours. Other analyses must be used too, and these are
offered by the Firstbeat method: a diary, questionnaires, or other indicators altogether.
For the physical side of things, it must be noted that, for example, a walk may not be
registered as a physically active period for people who are in good shape. There are
also differences between individuals. The status of the autonomic nervous system
changes rapidly for some people. They react quickly, but the operation of their central
nervous system is not more stressed, even if the indicator seems to show that it is. [26]
Data visualizations do not stand in a one-to-one illustrative relation to the empirical world:
crafting an image is a historically defined practice that relies on a combination of technical, literary
and social skills [4] (p. 8). Because of the many possible interpretations allowed by the
visualizations, it was important that they were not simply passed on to the participants. We
arranged coaching sessions, with five to eight participants in each, 2 in which the participants were
2

The coaching sessions were designed with Tuula Styrman, who has used Firstbeat reports in wellbeing
coaching. She was also in charge of the sessions, so the role of the researchers at this point was participatory rather
than instructive.

10
given background information about Firstbeat reports; the idea was to make it more transparent
that self-tracking devices are abstracting physical reactions into data flows and visualizations
by following certain conventions and assumptions. For instance, it is a convention that stress
is visualized as red and recovery green. Moreover, the images representing physiological stress
and recovery simplify and summarize the subjects’ everyday life on the basis of certain
technical assumptions.
The coaching part of this research, utilizing Firstbeat reports, shares features with the
ethno-mining used for cultural analysis [27] that combines the collection and analysis of
quantitative data with that of qualitative data in an iterative framework. The data visualizations
operate as shared artifacts for co-constructing and negotiating meaning; the reports are not treated
as factual accounts of stress and recovery but as part of knowledge creation and crafting research
findings in collaboration. The charts bring insights to the surface in people’s lives; they serve as
mediators and translators in the sense that they feed forward discussions and negotiations rather
than offering a transparent vista of people’s bodily reactions, or their daily lives.
Significantly, self-monitoring is not only about capturing data flows and transforming the body
into information; it also feeds this information back to people in a visual format, enabling and
promoting emotional attachments and intensifying them [5] (p. 237). Once visualized, the data generates
new kinds of affective ties between people and their measured actions and reactions [23,28]. For
instance, pedometer users can cherish the steps they have taken and develop a more affective
relationship either to their walking or the steps taken; numbers acquire qualities that promote new
kinds of walking-related practices [11] (p. 50). Similarly, the monitoring of the quality of sleep
through heart-rate variability measurements can deepen affective relations to one’s body. When
sleeping is subjected to tracking, it becomes an activity, or even a competence, that people feel that
they are good at. On the other hand, the tired body, pinned down by personal analytics, reflects
exhaustion caused by the energy that people put into work and care for others, thereby making their
contributions visible and of value.
In the coaching sessions, people recognized their days from the reports, and found satisfactory
explanations for the stress peaks and recoveries depicted in the images. Most of them also had
diary entries to support the reports: one of the women noticed that, in her case, hoovering promoted
physiological recovery. The data visualizations can “upgrade” everyday doings and underline the
fact that people weigh up the value that they give to the curves depicting stress and recovery. Work
around the house gains a new kind of importance by being a source of physiological recovery. In
other words, remedial moments at home and during the working day are appreciated in a new way:
snacks by the computer, a shared coffee break with co-workers, messaging on Facebook. Insights
such as these emphasize the fact that engagements with data doubles can encourage the detection of
something new and unexpected in permanence, in the way things are. Such observations were
typically mundane, but they provoked discussion and evoked emotional responses. Significantly,
data visualizations were interpreted by research participants as more “factual” or “credible”
insights into their daily lives than their subjective experiences. This intertwines with the
deeply-rooted cultural notion that “seeing” makes knowledge reliable and trustworthy [29].

11
Sometimes the details that people desired were not found in the data visualization, though they
might find something else. One of the participants regretted that he caught a cold during the study
period and could not exercise to see how it affected his physiological stress and recovery. Instead,
he found that the curves were informative about the course of his working days. He noticed that his
stress level decreased over lunch and that he recovered physiologically in the afternoon as the
office was getting emptier. In a later telephone conversation, he said that he had changed his
schedule so that he now goes to work earlier, starting work before eight in the morning. This way,
he felt, he might be able to avoid some stress during the work day.
The coaching sessions suggested that data doubles create emotional and practical involvements:
they represent something to which people can try to respond. However, not all information supplied
by the curves was equally unambiguous; they also provided data that people could not explain. For
example, one of the men was surprised to find that he did not relax in the evening. He wondered
whether his late-night stress peaks were due to the onset of a cold or to watching television, but he
could not find a satisfying answer. The white areas in the reports—the measurements between
stress peaks and recovery periods—also provoked lively conversation. The subjects found white
areas in their curves occurring during telephone conversations, meditation, art-gallery visits, play
with children, and wind-down after exercise. Meaningful things for them seemed to be happening
in the white areas. Somewhat disappointingly, explanations related to the measurement technology
could also be found for these events. For instance, during yoga, the control of breathing may cause
“abnormal” synchronization of heartbeat and breathing; the application cannot analyze the
heart-rate variation, which shows up as a white area in the report. White areas can also result if the
electrode is too loosely attached, the subject has muscle tension in the chest area that hinders
sensing of the weak electrical current from the heart, or extrasystoles. Analyses based on heart-rate
variations assume that the heartbeat is regular (sinus rhythm). In reality, even the hearts of healthy
individuals exhibit extra beats of various kinds, and the computer is unable to identify all of
them [20]. Failures of technology were treated as a nuisance, but they did not erode the research
participant’s desire to trust the data. Instead, many participants concluded that they wanted another
round of measurements in order to produce better data. The data were giving important clues, but
too much of life appeared to be taking place outside of the data flows. In order to gain a clearer
vision of the things that matter, people longed for more tracking and supporting evidence for the
curves depicted in the reports.
6. Making Sense of Recovery
The second study round aimed at deepening understanding of how people confront their data by
making explicit how participants could learn and benefit from the data collection and analysis. The
aim was to explore uses of data that might point towards formerly hidden possibilities and
directions, and demonstrate, for instance, how the data allow the reevaluation of “the personal” or
“the everyday”. We asked one of the participants from the first round, a 30-year-old father of small
children, to take part in the instruction session: he gave a visual presentation on his own results and
explained what knowledge and insights he had obtained from engagements with his data with the
support of a detailed journal of daily activities. Summarizing his experiences in an inspiring

12
manner, he explained what he had discovered about his daily rhythms, exercise, and alcohol
consumption. In addition, he described how surprised he was to find that his physiology might not
have been in sync with his expectations: for instance, spending time with a small child could feel
stressful but be physiologically a way to recover.
As before, the data reports were discussed in coaching sessions that were followed by individual
interviews. The coaching sessions were voluntary and a couple of research participants did not join
them, highlighting the fact that even in a self-tracking experiment such as ours, where people
volunteered to take part, data-enthusiasm was counter-balanced by data-indifference. In the sessions,
recovery periods, places, and techniques were identified from the data. Although the research
subjects were reminded that each individual is different in physiological terms and they should not
compare their reports directly with those of others, comparisons interested them. Plentiful recovery
was admired: a recurrent theme of conversations was how daily life could be made more balanced.
Time and again the research participants focused on the fact that, in light of physiological data,
daily activities that were found to coincide with physiological recovery were everyday chores:
mangling, folding laundry, fixing a bicycle, and doing handicrafts. Activities that promoted
recovery also included telephone conversations with one’s mother, reading a bedtime story to
children, and a successful meeting at work.
The purpose of individual interviews was to deepen the insights gained in coaching sessions, to
go over the course of the tracked day, and discuss and evaluate it in light of the measurement data.
Particular attention was paid to exceptional events and surprising outcomes in the data. The
interviews unfolded according to how deeply into their results the research participants were
prepared to go, a reminder of the private nature of personal data. A few subjects did not want to
discuss their daily events and physiological reactions with the researcher in great detail, nor had
everyone written journals. Some had no visible interest in their personal data and preferred a more
general discussion, focusing on the future of self-tracking technologies, or the philosophy of
happiness, for instance. Most participants had, however, detailed journal entries that they wanted to
share; they were enthusiastic about the possibility of engaging with their data.
Some research participants might have been concerned before getting the results, though upon
seeing the data they felt relieved. “I don’t need to be that worried,” as one of the men put it. One of
the younger women was happy to see that she was active during the day. “I am not exactly a couch
potato”, she happily concluded at the end of her lengthy inspection of the visualized data. Another
woman said she had been nervous about the feedback session, because she had been scared about
discovering the degree of stress her work entailed. The measurements did, in fact, support her
claims of tensions experienced at work. In the interview, she explained the history of a complicated
relationship with her supervisor. She had suffered stress-related physical symptoms, such as
headaches and stomach pain and, because of these, she had actively tried to avoid her supervisor by
scheduling her work for times when the supervisor was not in the office. The concrete presentation
of her irritation in visual form, however, forced her to think about the issue:
I clash with my closest supervisor. His behavior is annoying. The measurements prove
that I’m stressed when I’m in contact with him. I wonder what the coping strategies

13
another way. I react strongly, which requires thinking about. How will I arrange my
work? (Interview, [30])
Physiological reactions cannot be separated from social relations, even if people wish they could
be. The visualizations suggest that co-workers and supervisors generate stress. If one decides to
continue working in the same workplace, one way of avoiding stress is to avoid the unpleasant
person. Similarly, quarrels or tensions at home are stressful in light of measurement results. That
said, the tantrums of small children and rows with a spouse seemed to cause surprisingly little
stress, according to the data. Taking a child to a day-care center may feel stressful, but the
measurement data that allow research participants to examine their lives seem to point to it as not
exceptionally so. This visibility led to an attention to stress-free doing and being. From this
perspective, personal analytics can increase understanding about the importance of doing things
that require no particular effort. It can make waiting, resting, and daily routines recognized and
even valued: in terms of physiological recovery, “useless” activities gain a new kind of value by
becoming physiologically beneficial. Such observations on data flows generated discussions about
the nature of stress and stressful situations, meanwhile highlighting cultural uncertainty over stress
that indicates that the self-monitoring data actualizes relations and connections that are beyond
common ways of perceiving, knowing, and responding to things. Despite decades of research, little
is known of the way in which bodies, minds, and socialities co-constitute stress [31,32]. While the
measurement opens new vistas onto people’s lives, it calls for a rethinking of the elements of which
those lives are thought to consist. This can lead to the questioning of concepts, such as stress, that
are often taken for granted. Rather than a straightforward project of producing conditions for
healthier lives through self-tracking, the engagements with data doubles generate various kinds of
ideas of one’s behavior with and in relation to others, including those that can challenge existing
expertise on health and wellbeing.
7. A Slice of Larger Life
As personal analytics becomes more commonplace in homes, schools and workplaces, questions
of how and for what purposes self-monitoring data could and should be used become timely. With
the aid of self-tracking devices, everyday processes are translated into information. Everyday
life—its entities, relationships and processes—are not only captured and represented in abstract
graphs, tables and figures, but become negotiable and actionable. From the perspective of people’s
engagements with their data doubles the fact that self-tracking devices and data flows connect to
and mediate self-knowledge is crucial. Knowing becomes inseparable from the data visualizations;
smartphone applications and other monitoring devices act as mediators and translators that
contribute to making human reactions and life visible, identifiable and knowable. Similarly to gene
maps and brain scans, the visualizations produced by heart-rate variation measurements provoke
discussions and negotiations surrounding the value and meaning of the images, rather than
providing unambiguous answers and a transparent window onto the individual [8,23]. Tracking
technologies tell partial stories of much larger lives [27] (p. 10).

14
Data doubles are contemporary images, combining existing knowledge and skills, but they
also promote new kinds of practices and skills related to data. By enabling interactions and
engagements with people and their data doubles, our research demonstrates how data doubles can
provoke and activate an awareness of the body and the everyday, also providing possibilities for the
enhancement and improvement of life. The interpretation of measurement data, in an open-ended
and iterative framework, creates a participatory space that focuses on crafting research findings in
collaboration. Interpreting measurement data jointly with others (in this case, with other
participants in the study, researchers, and a hired coach) allows the research findings to build on
and resonate with people’s self-understanding and aspirations. Engagements with data doubles
illustrate the desire to enhance and improve daily lives: in our study people treated personal
analytics as a resource that could aid in learning about and forming practices contributing to the
achievement of a “fulfilled life”. At the same time, self-tracking was approached with curiosity;
people expected to be entertained and surprised by the research findings and they wanted to learn
new and unexpected things about themselves and others.
The indicators and measurements ultimately affect the measured, including the objects of
measurements and the ways the measured is valued (e.g., [23]). When people use measuring
devices to “prove” that massage or reflexology has health benefits alongside medication, or make
visible the physiological impacts of idle moments, art, caring for others, or alternative therapies,
their testimonies can gain new weight. Self-tracking technologies can open new routes to health
and well-being. Not all of our research participants, however, were equally excited or convinced
about such data-led possibilities. For some the idea of extracting knowledge from data flows was
ultimately not appealing; it was thought that it offered too individualistic and constraining a
window onto everyday lives. The refusal or lack of enthusiasm of this group to engage with data
doubles is a reminder of the fact that personal analytics is by no means a universally attractive way
to explore the previously inaccessible. Yet based on our findings, self-monitoring devices are
encapsulating the technical and the conceptual in a manner that will continue to appeal to people,
and generate new kinds of data engagements focusing on the self and social relations. Self-tracking
can be used for generating surveillance that probes ever more deeply into what it is to know and be
human, increasing the potential for greater control over one’s life. Control, however, also provokes
protest, a desire to act unexpectedly. Self-tracking devices teach people to encounter, use and interpret
data for purposes that go beyond the data.
8. Conclusions
This article has approached specific data engagements by emphasizing the device-precise ways
in which data is generated and visualized. Tracking devices are individualistic in their orientation,
solidifying existing economic and political divides: self-monitoring is spreading among those who
have the skills and means to connect to their bodies, minds and lives in data-driven ways. On the
other hand, they promote new frameworks for approaching normalities and pathologies in daily
lives. A powerful aspect of self-tracking tools is their ability to mediate the reimagining of the
present. For instance, phenomena that are considered discrete, such as addiction and use of time,
can be examined within a shared frame; addictions can be treated as a problem of time use rather

15
than as individual pathologies [33]. Thus a stimulating aspect of self-tracking technology that can
aid social research is the possibility it provides of transcending juxtapositions of the biological and
the social: the mind and the body, and the normal and the pathological interweave when everyday
actions and physiological reactions are described within the same research design. Here, studies
benefiting from self-tracking can build on and continue the long history of research into making
bodily experiences visible through a phenomenological research approach that describes personal
knowledge obtained through the body [34]. Self-tracking can add to this research tradition by
identifying and classifying physiological and bodily data that would be difficult, or even impossible,
to obtain otherwise [35]. Although a research design that uses self-tracking devices does not
promise a direct or unambiguous access to the personal or the individual, it does represent data on
bodily reactions in a thought-provoking manner.
A huge amount of energy is currently invested in developing self-monitoring devices and
applications [2] that compete with each other for their role as data centers in people’s lives. A study
such as ours demonstrates some aspects of the allure of data-led everyday lives. The playfulness
and creativity of people interacting with measuring devices suggests that tracking promotes
“numerical living” that can be fun and engaging. Another area of research arises from the fact that
people are actively using personal data for framing social wholes and entities, giving a new kind of
value to their personal realities and everyday doings. The manner in which data streams are being
worked and reworked suggest explanations that can produce permanence and stability, but can also
profoundly change ways in which people reflect on themselves, others and their daily lives.
Important in terms of future research on data doubles is the social life of data, including ways in
which self-tracking data is recognized, appreciated, affirmed and harnessed to various kinds of
purposes. These tie in with how specific monitoring devices shape assumptions and promises of
visibility and knowing, further connecting to research on how digital devices and the data that they
generate configure knowledge spaces in society and the social sciences [10].

The Touch Pad Body: A Generative Transcultural Digital
Device Interrupting Received Ideas and Practices in
Aboriginal Health
Michael Christie and Helen Verran
Abstract: Yolƾu Aboriginal understandings of the body, health, life and sickness, and roles their
ancestral epistemologies and knowledge practices play in making agreement have seldom been
taken seriously in the biomedical world. In this paper, we describe how insights developed in three
different cross-cultural collaborative transdisciplinary research projects led to the design of a
digital device aimed at intervening in communicative practices around body, health, life and
sickness, interrupting the received practices and assumptions on both sides of the practitioner-client
divide. The interrupting device slows down and opens up communication practices potentially
leading to mutual understanding, collective agreement making, and bottom-up changes in remote
Aboriginal health policy and practice.

1. Introduction
The subject of this paper is a digital device for use in those times and places where health
professionals and Aboriginal patients and their families are struggling to go on together in
generating plans and collective proceedings to achieve healthier Aboriginal individuals, families,
and communities. The device is an iPad or generic custom-designed touch screen application that
shows interactive biomedical images, animations and models. We propose that this application will
differ from other similar applications in that it will not embed any explicit health messages (it is not
didactic); it will not privilege the biomedical model of the human body and its functioning; it will
not contain any microscopic scale imagery, and will contain few sequential arrays of images. The
device will depend entirely upon users in conversation for its navigational logic and focus first on
aspects of the healthy body, only later introducing pathology in leading up to images of the
experience of chronic disease and its treatment. The design of the device is inspired by Yolƾu
principles of communication that we have gradually learned through our participation in other
health related projects. In this paper we first elaborate what we understand those principles of
communication to be in telling stories of the contexts in which we learned them. Then in our final
section we explain how these principles are expressed in the design of the Touch Pad Body.
However, we need to be clear in beginning, that this device has reached the concept protoype stage
only. At this point we have been unable to secure funding to actually build the device.

2. Knowledge and Agreement Making in Arnhem Land
The Yolƾu Aboriginal people of northeast Arnhem Land, Australia have a long tradition of
theorizing about knowledge production, conflict resolution and agreement making [1–3]. When
bilingual education was introduced to three major Yolƾu schools in the early 1970s, a long process
of mobilizing ancestral theory to inform curriculum and pedagogy began. As a young teacher in
1973 Michael was already a keen language learner when invited to become a teacher linguist, and
to work with Yolƾu knowledge authorities on research and literature production. Helen became
involved in 1987 when she found herself working with the Yirrkala School community under a
program of “Aboriginalisation” of the school supported by both the Yolngu elders and the
Department of Education. In particular, as a university lecturer in mathematics education she was
involved in “both ways” or “Garma Maths” curriculum development. Over the succeeding 40 years,
we have been involved in collaborative research and consultancy work which has extended the
reach of Yolƾu practices into much other work—including law, housing [4], financial literacy [5],
water management [6], community gardening [7], and digital knowledge work [8]. The particularly
difficult process of devising a digital “interrupting tool” to embed these agreement making
practices into the world of remote Aboriginal health is the subject of this paper.
The curriculum instituted by Yolƾu community elders at the Yirrkala Community School was
given the name of garma. In Yolƾu languages, garma refers to an open public ceremonial space
where people from different tribal and totemic lineages come together to produce a collaborative
performance and celebration of history, and a collective agreement on ways forward, here and now.
The garma “describes the format where a Yolƾu learning environment begins” [9]. The garma (like
Aboriginal education and transdisciplinary research) actually depends on identifying, respecting
and maintaining differences, working collaboratively, coming to agreement, and building agreed
ways of knowing and going ahead together [10,11].
All garma performances start off with an issue, be it a funeral or an initiation or maybe the
return of a sacred object to its maker’s descendants. They all entail a common purpose, and a claim
of authority. While each group has a large repertoire of songs, dances, gestures, paintings and
paraphernalia which can be presented alongside others who share parts of ancestral histories,
journeys and totems, they collaborate to choose carefully which songs (dances, names, gestures,
paintings, totemic objects) will be shared in this particular located garma, and how, while playing
out with other clans their collective history, they will also enact their own distinctive perspective
with their own authority in the work around this particular issue, here and now. Having the right
people in the right space together under the right authority is always critical to the work of making
agreement. Any individual, no matter how specialist, how expert, cannot decide the best way
forward alone. This robust Yolƾu epistemology keeps resurfacing in our work. Here, we tell of
three distinct research projects from which the conception of the touch pad digital device
draws inspiration.


20
3. Sharing the True Stories
By the 1990s, many Yolƾu who had been curriculum activists in Yolƾu schools were becoming
active in other research fields. This work involved a woman who was in her own right a Yolƾu
knowledge authority, an experienced Yolƾu educator and linguist, who had had to move from her
remote island home to the city of Darwin for dialysis. She became involved in advocacy for better
communication between medical practitioners and their renal patients. As a linguist I (the first
author) was invited to help with a research project aimed at identifying and rectifying common
causes of miscommunication [12]. Yolƾu medical patients, especially those with serious chronic
diseases, were often suspicious that they weren’t being told the true story about their illness. They
were also convinced that their own stories were not being taken seriously by the medical staff.
While she was only one of a large group of mostly white Australian researchers, this senior Yolƾu
woman convinced us pretty early to call the whole project “Sharing the True Stories” (STTS). She
flatly repudiated the simplistic conduit metaphor [13] which sustained the illusion (so common in
western understandings of communication) that messages are somehow passed from one person to
another as if along a conduit.
We were required to rethink communication as the building of shared understandings, and as the
research project developed we were often amused and bemused at how often the non-Aboriginal
researchers and workers on the renal floor reverted to the conduit metaphor when describing their
work and their frustrations to us. Through her own quiet contributions to the project, this
authoritative woman, speaking out of her experiences as a Yolƾu patient, showed us the key role of
narratives and of conversations which we were later to take with us into the work of designing
digital resources. One key outcome of the project deriving from the Yolƾu theory of
communication was increased attention to all the work which is done outside of the clinical
encounter, leading us to move away from the clinical encounter as the key locus of information
sharing and agreement making. The burden of communication in the clinical encounter—even with
an interpreter, is intolerable. While we worked to improve the work of engagement of interpreters,
we also concentrated on other things not immediately obvious as relevant to communication.
For example, a major outcome implemented in Stage 2 of the STTS project involved group
meetings around clinical encounters. Honest good-faith agreement upon often quite unusual,
specific ways forward for a particular patient involved something of a garma: a meeting together of
as many different experts as possible, nephrologists, dietitians, renal nurses, general practitioners,
social workers, as well as husbands, mothers, children friends, other patients from the same
language group. Moreover, as our senior Yolƾu colleague pointed out, the configurations of people
and spaces, charts and instruments also contribute to the garma, as does, of course, the patient, the
real expert on the body in question.
Almost unbeknownst to us, the Yolƾu researchers were leading us to understand and undertake
health communication in different ways, and these different ways needed to be taken seriously and
understood and acted upon collectively, if we were to make a lasting difference to patient and
community outcomes. (How those productive advances instituted in the renal unit were ultimately
slowly worn down by bureaucratic demands must be the subject of another paper.) We were not at
the stage of concentrating on developing a more general theory of health literacy, but are focusing

21
on particular sites where health literacy comes into play (see below). However, our first step had
been to engage an Yolƾu epistemology.
4. Healthy Breathing and Heart
Our digital device emerged also from outside the careful Yolƾu analysis of agreement making.
We were invited some years later by a senior thoracic surgeon from a large southern teaching
hospital, to help him review a suite of disparate digital resources which had been produced to
inform people about ‘healthy breathing and hearts’. He had hundreds of images and animations
which he showed to a sometimes bored, sometimes startled, sometimes fascinated and animated,
often irritated group of senior bilingual Yolƾu consultants over several days. His aim was to
produce the perfect health literacy tool to inform Aboriginal patients whose first language is not
English, and who may not be comfortable talking about intimate bodily things in an unfamiliar
tongue, about lungs, hearts, circulation and of course, smoking [14]. There were a few problems.
From the beginning there were many images, particularly those which showed microscopic details
which were simply incomprehensible. I could see that the taken for granted conventions for
representing movement, scale, and three dimensionality, for example, in our western graphic
traditions were often not coming across at all. It never occurred to the Yolƾu consultants, always
looking for a chance to build shared understandings in good faith, to say they had no idea what they
were looking at. Like patients in the Sharing the True Stories research, when they didn’t understand
something they smiled and nodded agreeably in the face of authority, waiting for something to
make sense. What did make sense to them was the top-down disciplinary nature of much of what
they were asked to review. It seemed to be blaming them and others for making bad life decisions
without ever giving them a chance to contribute their own opinions. It was hard for them to have a
reasonable conversation with the thoracic surgeon, despite him being gentle, generous and deeply
concerned about Indigenous health. He was completely disconcerted that the photos of diseased
organs were offensive, and to hear how wrong it is to say to a patient that there is a chance that the
lump they have presented could be a cancer. That is an offensive way to talk. The doctor should
say “If you are worried about that lump, we can do some tests and find out what’s going on there”.
How conversations produce symptoms was quite lost on the doctor who didn’t understand the ways
in which collective Aboriginal performances produce new possible worlds. We must therefore be
careful how we perform in a collective agreement making episode.
The outcome of the consultancy was, alas, further production of another top down disciplinary
digital resource, but that is another story. The conversations we had around how to talk to the
owner of an Aboriginal body led us still further towards a culturally sensitive technology.
5. Redefining Health Literacy
In the third research project we were asked with our Yolƾu colleagues, to evaluate needs for
health literacy, health communication and interpreters in east Arnhem Land. In the East Arnhem
Region Aboriginal Client Health Education (EARACHE) project, we interviewed over 50 community
members from five different communities in their own languages, and held extensive discussion

22
with another 50 health professionals [15]. We found many different roles and job titles—infant
health workers, general practitioners, Aboriginal health workers, mental health workers, community
health workers, ear health, etc.) and a vast array of health communication resources—digital and on
paper—were mostly unused. This was seen against the background of several distinct languages and
several distinct cultures, i.e., Aboriginal community life, the culture of small clinic health service
delivery, and plural government bureaucracies. The people we interviewed were tired of
researchers coming to troubleshoot the system, tired of the overwhelming and increasingly
differentiated health work force, and tired of the top-down disciplinary health literacy messages.
However, we also heard so many stories of unusual, highly productive collaborations across
boundaries of professional responsibility and across the boundaries of culture which were invisible
from above, unsupported, but carried out through long conversations with commitment and good
faith and good results.
Good health literacy, we concluded, especially in this remote Aboriginal context of extended
family and community living, is better understood not so much as what the individual client knows
about biomedicine, but rather the productive working together of the people and resources which
generate shared understandings and agreement. It involves good access to clear information, and
honest respectful discussion and agreement making across the divide between providers and
consumers. Health literacy is not so much a knowledge problem as a structural problem so there are
structural solutions. We began to talk of “systemic health literacy”. Present attempts to improve
Aboriginal health communication practices and “health literacy” tend to utilize a top-down policy
approach which seem to blame the client for irresponsible life choices and ways, and/or front line
workers for poor delivery. Yet health professionals, clients and families were often using their
discretion to create good open collaborative ways of working together. How could we support
this work?
We came to understand “policy” as the cumulative effect of the individual decisions made by
front line workers producing slow but effective and evidence-based bottom-up changes to practice [16].
We found Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people discerning what is working on the ground,
supporting it, having conversations around difficult decisions about chronic diseases, and making
informed decisions together. We also found that resources that contain health messages seldom
stimulated these productive conversations which promote new productive collaborations across the
boundaries between health professionals, service users and their families. On the contrary, they
actually tended to entrench definitions, roles and attitudes rather than modify them.
So in the EARACHE project we sought to develop strategies consistent with the knowledge and
agreement practices we had developed with our Yolƾu co-researchers in STTS. Aboriginal clients
have strong ideas and practices of embodiment and well being which might be quite different from
those in other constructions, say of policy makers or health professionals or interpreters. Received
views of agency in the rhetoric around health literacy infect our ability to offer alternative strategies
for improved practices. We attend to the agency of these health communication resources.


23
6. The Touch Pad Interrupting Tool
A collective approach to dealing with the problems of the moment allows us to remain
respectful of both government and Aboriginal community members and the participants in their
worlds—even though they may be quite different. A collective approach allows us to avoid
assuming the salience of the biomedical model, as well as the individualism of western ethics and
political philosophies. There are many good health literacy resources out there, and we will
encourage their use, but we propose a different sort of object which we have designed in the
process of the HBH research project.
We propose a radically different resource, a user-friendly touch-pad animation of a diagrammed
human body which has no message, no sequence. It is manipulable, zoomable, transparent, three
dimensional, detailed in particular areas (heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, pancreas, ears). Such bodily
structures are familiar to patients and their families and to health professionals, albeit in different
ways. The diagramming of the Touch Pad Body de-emphasises biomedical details and assumptions.
It stimulates conversation—in any language or mixture of languages. The conversations which the
interactive diagram generates will not be unlike the conversations through which it is iteratively
developed. Designed collaboratively, its development and its use will be coterminous. Which parts
it shows and which it conceals, its genders and its pathologies will all be designed and developed
collaboratively so it emerges as a body which is both Aboriginal and biomedical emergent in
exchange in particular times and places.
So how does this device embody the principles of communication we have learned from our
Yolƾu colleagues in a number of projects across several years? The device promotes a sharing of
the burden, and a continuation of the so called “phatic” elements of communication. This is the
work done by such utterances as “Hello. How are you?” It is the work of promoting sociability in
which mutually engaging communication can occur. The device in part provides a form of
diagrammatic infrastructure to enables that phatic work to continue and importantly to be done on
all sides, so that it is not only Aboriginal patients who find themselves doing all the work. However,
more substantively, when it comes to human bodies the device works at a level “below” the
ontological, and the emergent diagram it provides is not a representation of a determining structure.
As itself an emerging body in the here and now of the clinical encounter—albeit of a very
different corporeality than a flesh and blood human body, the diagram will interrupt the
presumptions of all contributing parties presuming “neither biomedical certainties, nor Aboriginal
certainties about bodies” [17]. By using the device as a diagram to pilot a conversation around the
individual problem of the moment, accepting the constraints of that particular here and now, and
not obliged to import and to promote “theories about bodies” formulated in other times and places
which may or may not be salient to the issues at hand, the device evades a priori assumptions at
work in the working stories of all these different participants (the biomedics, the Aboriginal patients,
the social workers, family members, etc.), which entrench received assumptions, and prevent us
from thinking and acting together in new ways.
The Touch Pad Body will likely split into various versions, with the possibilities of adding
family members and environments, as they suffer when individuals suffer and take part in

24
treatment and healing. Some version may find its way into schools, or to the training of health
workers and interpreters [18]. However, by its very ambiguity, its capacity to absorb contradictions
and tread the tight-rope of equivocation it will always open up the opportunity to interrupt the
assumptions of strangeness or certitude at work between the Aboriginal and the biomedical.
In the EARACHE project it was clearly impossible for us to recommend any top down structural
changes to health literacy projects which would guarantee a direct improvement on the health literacy
of 7000 people. However, we did recommend the support of flexible collective ground-level
discretion and decision making wherever there is openness and interest to start the conversation
going, and to join up existing individuals and services. Our Touch Pad Body can actively stimulate
this work, particularly by making itself an essential, well known public resource, (through making
its images available more widely through posters, websites, leaflets, etc.) and by its very ubiquity it
could institutionalize collective agreement making over medical issues, marginalize the autocratic
practitioners including some of the fly-in fly-out specialists, and cry out for a garma-style setting
which activates complex intercultural conversation to generate a unique complex way forward for
this medical issue here and now. Moerover, those using it would be part of the collective iterative
design, development, implementation and evaluation project. Our device interrupts received notions
and entrenched practices by getting as many authoritative people talking about each medical
decision in their own way, but together. Our yet unfunded, undeveloped digital device will help
this bottom-up change in mutual understanding, agreement making and informed consent to
reverberate upwards towards changing policies and practices at higher levels. We look forward to
working with this device, when funds are made available to bring it fully to life. There are issues
associated with its interventions that can only be dealt with ‘face-to-face’ with the device, so to
speak. How can we contrive the routines and the techniques by which agreement over how to build
agreement in ways that explicitly involve humans and non-humans actively contributing? In
particular where and how might the important principle of informed consent be given its due?
In all this piecemeal work, our digital garma device will promote a new coherence and
reflexivity in the ways in which service users and providers approach their work with Aboriginal
patients and their families. Real change comes when categories are unsettled, where we have
conversations which allow us all to rethink our assumptions and our collective possibilities.
Finding new ways of understanding and enhancing health literacy requires using the language and
tools available for developing a generative health literacy policy and practice, first of all at the local
level. Both Aboriginal people and governments could be “end users” of research, providing an
evidence base, which should not be different from making policy change.
7. Conclusions
Yolngu Aboriginal principles of communication have been conveyed in telling stories out of
our experiences of participating in health related research projects under the tutelage of senior
Aboriginal people, often themselves clients of health delivery services. Acting on this gradually
developed understanding of Yolngu experience and expectations of how the clinical experience
should proceed, we have worked with designers to develop an electronic communication device
that interrupts the normal clinical encounter. The device elicits phatic contributions from both

25
clinical personnel and Aboriginal clients; exchanges that attend to the important work of
maintaining the sociability of the encounter. In addition it deflects the precise clinical observations
and prescriptions of health professionals away from what is experienced as unwarranted and
unacceptable imagined intrusions into actual patient bodies, to instead become expressions of
concern for the Touch Pad Body generated in the encounter, as an intimate, interactive ‘stand-in’
for the patient’s body. This enables, as a subsequent distinct step, informed delicate negotiations
over agreement to responsibly accept medical interventions. This device currently exists as a
concept prototype as we are yet to secure funds to take the device to a further stage.

Understanding Digital Health as Public Pedagogy:
A Critical Framework
Emma Rich and Andy Miah
Abstract: This paper argues on behalf of a public pedagogy approach to developing a critical
understanding of digital health technologies. It begins by appraising the hitherto polarised
articulations of digital innovation as either techno-utopian or techno-dystopian, examining these
expectations of technology and considering the tensions between them. It subsequently outlines how
a public pedagogy approach can help mediate between these views, offering a more contextualised,
socio-political perspective of mHealth. This approach teases out the nuances of digital health by
engaging with the complexities of embodied learning. Furthermore, it urges caution against
viewing these pedagogical forces as one of transference, or simple governance. To this end, we
therefore contextualise our critique of digital health, within an attempt to reconstitute an
understanding of public pedagogies of technology.

1. Introduction
In recent years, the surveillance of people’s lives, bodies and health has been accentuated by the
proliferation of digital systems and, in particular, the development of Internet-based technologies,
which have significantly changed the way people engage with the data that surrounds their lives.
The range of digital tools available is broad and a considerable amount of research has taken place
to study how people negotiate their health in digital spaces, most apparent within the archives of
the Journal of Medical Internet Research.
For many years, the focus of cybermedical encounters was on interactions that take place
through websites and the wider impact of computer culture. Within this body of work, there was a
tendency to engage with discourses of the utopian or dystopian consequences that may arise from
an increasingly digital society. The Internet was considered to be a place that had the potential to
change society in fundamental ways. In the case of the utopian expectations, early studies about the
Internet wrote of how it would revolutionise society, breaking down social barriers and making the
world a better place. Research focused on structure and inter-personal dimensions, which would
free people from burdens associated with the physical world, such as the constraints of image and
identity [1,2]. Such prospects led some researchers to advocate the alteration or elimination of
bodies as a desirable future for humanity [3,4]. The obsolete body was thus seen as the
manifestation of a techno-utopia.
In the context of health care, these expectations were reinforced by views that foresaw the
capacity of digital technology to create a more cost-effective way of delivering health care.
Moreover, the proliferation of digital technologies across all sectors of society would lead to an
increased utilization of and reliance upon digital solutions within the healthcare sector. Emerging

28
out of an era of telemedicine and, later, discourses around “cybermedicine” and mobile health [5],
the appeal of digital solutions occurred against a backdrop of welfare cuts, rising health care
concerns about the global increase in “lifestyle” diseases such as obesity. In this sense, digital
health—as a focus for policy investments—flourishes as a result of its capacity to generate greater
efficiencies within an already overburdened system. Integral to this utopian discourse on
cybermedicine’s capacity to revolutionize healthcare, a further discourse has developed that
focuses on how digital technology could radically alter the quality of provision and better reinforce
some of the ethical aspirations of medicine. For instance, researchers wrote about how health care
could promote patient autonomy and professional accountability [6,7]. In this sense, digital health
was not just a way of delivering more efficient care, but better quality care as well.
In contrast, among the public discourse on this brave new virtual world were anxieties about
how it would lead to more disenfranchised, lonely individuals, with diminished social skills and,
potentially, dispositions that would be bordering on clinically alarming, addiction to cyberspace
being a commonly expressed concern. Such dystopian views were articulated in relation to video
game culture, framed by a similar kind of moral panic that has surrounded other new media forms,
such as certain genres of popular music, or film. Thus, the Internet was seen as a place where bad
things happen to otherwise good people. These views have been re-articulated with each new
innovation online, from social media to wearable technology [8,9]. For instance, neuroscientist
Susan Greenfield is frequently given space in the media to warn people of virtual worlds, claiming
that too much time online can even be detrimental to processes within the brain [10].
As web studies emerged more formally in the late 1990s, and as more rigorous methodological
approaches developed for analysing what takes place online [11], less attention was given to the
long term transformative dimensions of the Internet, and more focus was placed on what was
actually taking place online. As a result, the research community of digital studies scholars
fragmented very early on in the development of this new thematic area and this fracturing makes it
difficult to assert that there was a single techno-utopian vision of cyberspace that was envisioned
for health care. Equally, policy debates focused more on the instrumental benefits of telemedicine
and their parameters were far narrower than imagining anything as grand as utopia. Indeed, too
much digital health was seen as antithetical to utopia, at least in terms of governance. The rise and
fall of Google Health evidences the limitations of digital health interventions aimed at transferring
responsibility wholly to the individual away from the state.
In this context, our initial critical reaction to discourses on digital health is to deny that there
was ever a sufficiently wide perspective on the prospects of digital health to warrant its being
described as a techno-utopian project. Instead, there were instrumental aspirations around
promoting digital health, which were about governance and, to some extent, ethics. However, there
was no wider moral framework in which these aspirations for health care were situated. Thus, if a
utopia—in the commonly employed sense of the term—may be used to describe a state of
perfection, then the instrumental digital health discourse was considerably lacking, since it failed to
attend to some of the complex consequences of providing health care at a distance.
In sum, looking back over the early years of web studies reveals a degree of mythology about
the Internet’s potential, whereby the few futurists and scholars who occupied this territory became

29
disproportionately influential at shaping the discourse about this subject area. The likes of Howard
Rheingold [12] and even Sherry Turkle’s [13] early work, were, on balance, minor influences in the
trajectory of social scientific studies of digital health, but their libertarian claims are probably best
ignored when attempting to engage with the development of the discipline’s history. It is
reasonable to be ambivalent about this state of affairs, since much of the instrumental research
surrounding digital health - typified by the articles published in the Journal of Medical Internet
Research—would benefit from greater scrutiny from a cultural theory lens. Indeed, a lot has
changed since these early years of theorising the web and this deserves some critical reflection, so
as to understand what interpretations are appropriate today to arrive at a more critical view.
2. The Mobile Web and App Culture
One clear insight from this early period is that it is important for researchers to consider what
still needs to be investigated in digital health studies, but perhaps more crucially, what critical
theoretical lens is most appropriate to address the complexity of what takes place online. We
address this by focusing on the trend towards utilizing mobile devices to navigate the Internet.
Mobile devices are playing an increasing role in the digital economy, experiencing more growth
than computer sales worldwide. Furthermore, the number of mobile devices that exist in the world
already exceeds the world’s population. Moreover, it has become apparent recently that mobile
web usage is in decline and, instead, a growth in mobile app usage has been registered [14]. This
means that people are using mobile browsers and websites less, choosing instead to access content
directly through mobile application stores, such as the Google Play store and Apple App Store.
This is a compelling reason to study how people engage with their health via mobile devices.
Yet, it also appears that “mHealth” [5] is quickly becoming a core mechanism through which
people become complicit in engendering systems of surveillance that can be framed by commercial
or political interests. Unlike web browsers, which are relatively transparent in how they capture and
monitor a user’s data, users of mobile apps may have little understanding of how the data that is
captured about their health is utilized. However, such data can have dramatic impacts on various
industries who will happily pay for access to such information to further their goals, whether these
are governmental or commercial. The increasingly ubiquitous presence of mobile devices ensures
their place as a core driver of health engagement. The global significance of this cannot be
underestimated, as mHealth is capable of functioning in environments where there is no cabled
broadband infrastructure, which means it is more suited to use within nations that have limited
infrastructures. The importance of the mobile device market and, in particular, 3G and 4G
infrastructure is made apparent in the recent investments by both Google and Facebook in airborne
Internet provision. Thus, studying mobile culture in the context of health is of particular value, as it
resonates with the direction of travel in global communications in a way that more effectively
alleviates the digital divide.
We also narrow our analytical lens even further by looking specifically at mobile health apps
that relate to physical activity and lifestyle. Such apps, which allow users to track their exercise
behaviour, body weight, and food consumption, represent a significant proportion of the health app
market, making their communities a critical mass of interest. Indeed, exercise, body weight and

30
dieting apps are amongst the most popular downloaded health apps [15]. Moreover, 80% of the
population in Europe has carried out a health-related search on the Internet [16] and mobile phone
subscriptions worldwide reached nearly 7 billion in 2013 [17]. In this context, the present paper
focuses on the utilization of self-tracking mobile technologies associated with physical activity
lifestyle and health promotion.
Changes in public health promotion focused on “lifestyle” have been brought about by rapid
developments in digital health technologies [18]. In recent years, healthcare and health promotion
has operated through “e-scaped medicine” [19] no longer confined to clinical institutions but,
instead, delivered through “diffuse and fragmented” networks of locations. This has led to a
proliferation of research that explores how best to utilize digital systems to predict, diagnose, treat,
and monitor health. At the same time, it has created patients who are much more inclined to use
technology to monitor their health and, thus, be more complicit in their own surveillance, albeit
within platforms where data that is consumed is under the watchful gaze of the platform owners
and unspecified third parties who can purchase their data for their own goals. Indeed, one of the
challenges with the growth of mobile health apps is the difficultly we have in understanding the
information chain where our own agency becomes a commodity for use by other organizations.
In others words, while greater access to technology may have narrowed the digital divide, the
rapid transformation of digital platforms—if only from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0 architecture—has
widened the digital literacy divide. These circumstances compel researchers to think critically
about the locations in which a public understanding of digital culture develops, beyond formal
education systems. This is particularly important in the context of health, since being able to
negotiate the digital terrain effectively can determine one’s capacity to experience greater
autonomy or to derive greater insights into one’s health. Yet, one may look precisely to how
education has also changed as a result of the Internet era and bringing together these two
dimensions—health and education—is a helpful way of developing a critical approach to mHealth.
Indeed, education has expanded beyond its conventional realms over the last decade. The trajectory
towards lifelong learning, and even such programmes as “one laptop per child” or Sugata Mitra’s
“hole in the wall” programme, speak to the wider spaces in which innovative educational practice
is delivered through technology and often within a public context. Other examples, such as
MOOCs and qualification “badges” each further articulate how traditional education systems are
developing more publicly facing programmes.
3. A Public Pedagogy Approach to mHealth
This shift has been accompanied by a groundswell of scholarship that draws on the theoretical
construct of “public pedagogy”. Whilst the emergence of the field of public pedagogy has presented
possibilities for new approaches to understanding education, it consists of varied perspectives. In
their comprehensive mapping of the field and review of literature spanning 1894–2010, Sandlin
O’Malley and Budrick [20] identify a lack of definitional theoretical clarity in the way in which
public pedagogy has been conceptualised and applied across a broad set of literature, from the role
of school in preparing young people for citizenship through to the public pedagogies of dominant

31
discourses. Approaches to public pedagogy have been informed by a broad range of literature
including curriculum studies, adult learning, lifelong learning, critical pedagogy, feminist studies.
As an analytical device, public pedagogy is located at the intersection of numerous disciplines,
including but not limited to pedagogy, sociology, and cultural studies. On this basis, it offers
exciting potential for critical explorations of the relationships between the educative force of a
range of cultural sites in people’s lives and engagement with physical practices, corporeality and
subjectivities. Inquiries into understanding how and what people are learning about the (in)active
body through these emerging technologies aligns with a Physical Cultural Studies approach which
David Andrews [21] (p. 45) defines as a:
“Synthesis of empirical, theoretical and methodological influences (drawn from, among
other sources, the sociology and history of sport and physical activity, the sociology of
the body, and cultural studies) that are focused on the critical analysis of active bodies
and specifically the manner in which they become organized and represented, and
experienced in relation to the operations of social power.”
A growing body of influential work has examined the impact of new media on the organisation,
representation and experiences of the body, operating within these various physical cultures
Andrews describes above. Yet, as Freishtat and Sandlin [22] observe, there has been a limited body
of work exploring the public pedagogies of technologically mediated spaces. This reveals a lack of
explicit focus on the pedagogical processes operating in the digital environments described above.
Drawing on a range of theoretical perspectives, questions have emerged as to how far health
professions and individual users of technologies are prepared to incorporate these kinds of
technological applications into their lives and what kinds of ethical issues might arise. Their
legitimacy and desirability has been the focus of a number of important contributions to this debate
across a range of disciplines (philosophy, surveillance studies, social sciences, cyberstudies, new
media studies). The relationships between these technologies and their users have been explored
through various theoretical perspectives of surveillance and governance, but these have not framed
the relationship as one of learning or pedagogy. In attempting to contribute to this developing
theoretical discussion, we approach these issues from a different perspective, endeavouring to make
clear a justification for a critical engagement with mobile health technologies from a public
pedagogy approach. Thus, we wish to reposition a critical perspective on digital health and suggest
that an effective way of doing so is through the lens of public pedagogy. We do not argue that
this approach should replace others, but that it offers a complementary approach within a
multidisciplinary critical perspective that is capable of synthesising a range of critical priorities in
how we analyse digital health interactions. As Hickey-Moody and colleagues [23] argue, public
pedagogy approaches function as “bridges or rather, as multiple crossing points, between the fields
of education, sociology and cultural studies”.
Each of these transformations to understanding education and mHealth speak to a wider opening
up of what were previously closed practices—health and education. What took place in each of
these areas of society was locked behind institutional systems, such as schools, universities,
doctor’s surgeries and hospitals. In the era of mobile health, these encounters with health and

32
education have become more public facing, social experiences. Furthermore, there is a trend
towards greater visibility in digital spaces, a theme made evident in the recent popularity of
“selfies”—self portrait photos taken on mobile devices. Indeed, a helpful example in the crossover
between health issues and digital visibility is the recent “dare to bare” campaign, which saw
women sharing selfies online without wearing makeup in order to show solidarity and support for
cancer sufferers. Various commentaries have emerged around this grass roots phenomenon, but
what seems salient to our inquiry is the way in which self-mediation interfaces with health and the
manner in which somebody’s public self is a vehicle for health communication and education.
Thus, creating a #daretobare selfie photograph may be considered a political act, as it engages
people with discussions about authenticity, identity, solidarity, health and selfhood, while also
forces us to think about representation and individuality set against a proliferation of celebritised,
photoshopped images which bear little resemblance to real people. Individuals who chose to ‘dare
to bare’ were exercising their empowered, socially situated selves and, in so doing, were actively
raising awareness about the need for cancer research, if not as individuals, then as a collective.
Explaining the trend towards greater visibility in digital space requires a range of conceptual
apparatus, but Ruckenstein [24] (p. 68) gets close to what is at stake when discussing how “smart
phones and tracking devices” have created a “field of personal analytics” and “self-monitoring
practices”. Thus, we steer away here from concluding that either digital technology is taking us
towards a utopia where its users feel necessarily empowered or better off, or that digital media will
ultimately enslave us to some dystopian nightmare scenario. Rather, it is useful to contextualise this
distinction between perspectives that celebrate the value of digital technology and those that adopt
a more worrisome approach. The rise of mobile health apps does not simply respond to a vision of
health, but can also be considered characteristic of a “confessional society” [25]. To this end, we
ask what theoretical frameworks might aid us in yielding more complex and nuanced understandings
of surveillance within these contexts and help mediate between the above dichotomy. By drawing
from, and building on, the contributions of an emerging field of public pedagogy scholarship, it is
possible to ask different, perhaps deeper, questions about individuals’ engagement with digital
health technologies.
In advancing a public pedagogy approach to theorising digital health, it is necessary to recognise
how technology is inextricable from the manner in which people learn about health. Furthermore,
these apparatus dictate conditions of self-tracking, collection of data, and monitoring, which have a
bearing on what and how people learn about their bodies and health. Yet, there is no singular
approach to public pedagogy and so it is crucial to first clarify the analytical approaches they offer
in critiquing digital health. Thus, we draw from the work of Jake Burdick and colleagues in
“problematizing public pedagogy” [26] and we examine the utility of its current application and
appropriation, while endeavouring to build on and develop this body of work so that it develops a
more critical perspective of digital health.
Public pedagogy scholarship is flourishing at a time when the distinction between public and
private spaces has been significantly complicated and confronted by our emerging digitality. These
conditions frustrate some of the established narratives around public pedagogy scholarship. Thus,
we are cautious to claim that these pedagogical forces lead to transference, or simple forms of

33
governance. Instead, we seek to understand: “how these educational sites and practices actually
work to teach the public and how the intended educational meanings of public pedagogies are
internalised, reconfigured and mobilized by public citizens” [20].
Given the diversity of approaches to public pedagogy, what should be meant when invoking this
concept to make a case for a more critical perspective of digital health? Whilst public pedagogy is a
contested term, there is some general consensus within the field that it comprises a focus on the
kind of learning that takes place outside of formal schooling. Thus, in developing an account of
digital health as pedagogical, it is necessary to start with a vision of education that recognises how
learning—albeit about one’s body and health in this case—can occur in sites and contexts beyond
formal schooling. This is precisely the approach that has characterised public pedagogy in recent
years. A number of notable theorists [27–32] have drawn attention to contemporary sites of
learning beyond the boundaries of formalized education sites, forming what has been announced as
the field of “public pedagogy”. Attention has therefore been recast in educational research towards
processes of education that take place across a variety of sites, including museums, zoos, libraries,
media, popular culture, commercial spaces, grassroots activists movements, and more recently
through the work of “public intellectuals” (see [20,32]). In this paper, we extend this also to digital
platforms, such as social media environments, which are being positioned as technologically mediated
pedagogical spaces [22]. Yet, as Freishtat and Sandlin [22] (p. 505) go on to suggest “there is a
significant gap in the literature inquiring into the emergence of technologically mediated spaces as
locations of cultural production, education, and learning among youth.” Furthermore, in line with
the critiques by Glen Savage [33], the multiplicity of public pedagogy approaches raises questions
about what counts as “pedagogical” phenomena. In digital health environments, this may be especially
difficult to discern, since many of them may not be recognisable as “learning” environments.
Nevertheless, it is reasonable to acknowledge that a necessary, if not sufficient, condition of
public pedagogy’s utility lies in its focus on understanding education, as it occurs in sites beyond
formal institutions. Underpinned by theoretical contributions from cultural studies, feminism,
pedagogy, and other disciplinary perspectives, the focus of public pedagogy has been on more
resistant forms of critical pedagogy, and on identifying dominant discourses, drawing attention to the
educational force of popular culture [34]. However, recognising public pedagogy as a distinct field
remains somewhat premature, as its conceptual trajectory is still being formed. Hickey et al. [23]
propose the term “pedagogy writ large” to capture a general set of theoretical conceptualizations
“public pedagogy” and “cultural pedagogy”, which frame pedagogy in this broader sense.
Therefore, a perspective of digital health arising out of public pedagogy approaches must be
mindful of the tendency for scholars to cite the “term without adequately explicating its meaning,
context or location within differing articulations of the construct.” [26] (p. 3). In doing so,
whilst we advocate the need for an educational framing of digital health, we also consider the
work of Burdick, Sandlin and O’Malley [26] and Savage [33] to be essential, when extending
and problematizing notions of public pedagogy in the context of mHealth. At such a juncture,
Budick et al. [26] (p. 3) offer an instructive trajectory for public pedagogy, based on an architecture
of three key areas; “framing, exploring the problematics of public pedagogy’s definition, the
organization and historicity; studying, emphasizing the ways in which our research simultaneously

34
illuminates and obfuscates the object of inquiry; and enacting, taking up the ways in which we
view and engage with our own pedagogical acts outside of institutional spaces.” This provides a
useful architecture through which to outline a public pedagogy approach to digital health, whilst
also calling into question some of the tensions inherent within these approaches. By drawing on
their framework, we simultaneously apply public pedagogy to our critique of mHealth, while also
exploring the problematics of its current definition (framing), and considering how this obfuscates
certain aspects of learning through technology (studying).
4. Governmentality and the Public Pedagogies of “Nag Technologies”
If public pedagogy is characterised by how learning takes place outside of formal educational
structures, then clearly a prominent feature of where such learning takes place is within those
informational spaces that surround every day life, notably digital spaces. To this end, a further
characteristic of public pedagogy may be the conditions of such experience, which, we recognise,
has to do with the way people negotiate their public persona and the manner in which they are
complicit in self-surveillance. After all, the promotion of healthy behaviours through mobile apps
has intensified processes of surveillance and regulation of people’s everyday lives, raising a
number of questions about their applications. Such devices as iPads, Fitbit wristbands, patches, or
GPS equipment, require users to collect and log data, which builds a profile of their lifestyle,
including where they have walked, how fast they walked, and what they did along the way. Indeed,
part of the appeal of these tools is that they gamify [35] the experience of monitoring health,
introducing playful dimensions that encourage user participation. This may include documenting
exercise habits, diet, weight with reward systems, motivational tools, and all of this data builds a sense
of the “quantified self” [5,36], while also linking this publicly through social media. Products such
as the Nike+ fuelband (a wristband designed to monitor and measure “whole body movement”) is a
good example of this, since it also has a built in capacity to share achievements with friends.
Thus, the platform integrates a public dimension predicated on the user’s interest to share what they
have done.
Users of these technologies are complicit in shaping the culture of self-surveillance that
underpins digital societies and the degree to which people share what they do may speak to a
willingness to be subject to an outsider’s gaze upon their bodies. Yet, the legitimacy and
desirability of these technologies has recently occupied public attention, with recent news media
documenting the rise of what has been termed “nag technology”—that is, technology which
persistently nags its user to be active and live a healthy lifestyle. The cultural and regulative
connotations of this term are clear to see. The public pedagogic focus here is on the “dominant
cultural discourses” within “popular culture and everyday life” [20], which compel people towards
healthy behaviours. In other words, users are asked to learn how to look after themselves via the
disciplining regularity of the device’s presence and regular notifications to maintain their good
behaviour. According to Sandlin et al. [20], current approaches within public pedagogy draw upon
popular pedagogies to, “to link cultural and media artifacts to processes of social domination”.
Perhaps the most well-known theorist to have contributed to this work is Henry Giroux [27,37].
Giroux’s work on popular culture and pedagogy and, particularly, “corporate public pedagogy” as a

35
“a powerful ensemble of ideological and institutional forces whose aim is to produce competitive,
self-interested individuals vying for their own material and ideological gain” [38] is particularly
informative here. Furthermore, Giroux has been crucial in fashioning contemporary understandings
of the educational force of such popular cultural sites as film, television, and the Internet.
Public pedagogy work of this nature draws on principles consistent with a focus on the dominant
discourses promoted through educational sites, and the ways in which popular culture is utilised as
a form of governmentality. From this perspective, dominant discourses of digital health are
inextricably tied to the neoliberal discourses flowing through these digital technologies, demanding
the neoliberal subject capable of acquiring information, monitoring and adjusting their
bodies/lifestyles in relation to this information. Imbued with the negative implications of these
technologies, which are partly consistent with the dystopian perspectives on digitality described
earlier, it calls into question the narratives of empowerment that advocates of digital health would
have us believe are the outcomes of a digital life.
When endeavouring to make sense of these shifts, Lupton [5] observes that the rapid growth and
popularity of “mHealth” reflects the trend towards self-tracking as a way of managing one’s
lifestyle in line with the logic of a growing movement known as “the quantified self”, where one
collects and charts data, shares it and gathers real time feedback about it, which is then used to take
better “care of the self” [39] and modify one’s behaviour. This may involve sharing how far one
has run and receiving encouragement from friends, which then incentivises the user to continue, or
making weight loss targets. From this interpretation, one can critically explore how these digital
devices act as pedagogical devices through certain pedagogical frames, such as the quantification
of self, the confessional, surveillance, and the importance of self-evaluation. Mobile health
technologies, particularly those associated with health promotion, exhibit particular pedagogic
processes in the management of bodies. The transparency of these lessons provides a critical
framework through which to examine the regulative force alluded to in this populist terming of
digital health. Thus, mobile apps and social media sites are some of many examples of media texts
or artifacts that warrant analysis as vehicles of public pedagogy.
With their accompanying processes of surveillance and evaluation, these technologies imply
expectations of control, which are to be learned and reproduced by users. In this fashion, the appeal
and explanatory potential of this conceptualisation lies in its analytical focus on the connection
between popular culture and neoliberalism in explicating its educative force in the management of
bodies through new digital health platforms. Pedagogically, this represents a shift from
learning digital norms of techniques of the body [40]—of users knowledge of “how to use their
bodies”—towards a focus on learning how to use information “about their bodies” [40] (p. 70). A
good example of this is a mobile app that required users to make necessary plastic surgical
interventions to an avatar to make her beautiful. As one tech magazine writes: “The game...rated
for children 9 and older...walked players through the graphic steps of liposuction that must be
performed on an “unfortunate girl” to make her “slim and beautiful” [41]. Compelled by a Twitter
protest campaign going under the hashtag #EverydaySexism, the app was eventually removed from
the App store.

36
Such an example raises questions about how, increasingly, younger people engage with these
technologies as pedagogical devices through which they learn to recognise themselves and/or
others as good, healthy, active and/or having desirable bodies in the pursuit of “healthiness”.
Framed through the lens of public pedagogy, young people use these participatory technologies to
learn not only about “health” activities, but also of what and whose bodies may be valued, given
status, and how to meet the expectations of particular body pedagogies [42]. In the plastic surgery
app, fatness is depicted as “matter out of place” [43] to be removed through processes of extreme
modification. The regulation of and management of bodies in these mobile apps and social media
environments corresponds with an idealised version of acceptable bodies and the abjection of
others’ bodies. In adhering to the corporeal order and normalisation of thinness, users are exposed
to particular body pedagogies. Moreover, these applications depict particular bodies and subjects as
marginal, different or even problematic and abject. Through game playing scenarios, the removal
of adiposity through surgery reinforces the idea that “if embodied subjects fail to conform or
perform to bodily norms, they stand to be classified as expendable waste; a waste that must be
purified or hidden if society is to be maintained as a realm of order and productivity.” [44] (p. 3). In
the plastic surgery app, bodies that are overweight are therefore positioned negatively as abnormal
and in need of modification, in contrast with the embodied subjects that emerge after surgery.
The educational function of these apps is to normalise the fight against fatness or obesity, which,
in turn, may influence and condition its users. Therefore, these digital spaces emerge as important
pedagogical devices, as they become sites through which users learn about their own and others
bodies and “add to an understanding of how a curriculum of enculturation occurs within the social
context of networked technologies” [22] (p. 509). Similarly, in the context of health promotion
apps that monitor and regulate body data, Lupton focuses on “the kinds of meanings and the
representation of the ideal subject that are related to the use of these technologies in the interests of
promoting health” [5] (p. 232).
While it is apparent that one should question the legitimacy of the learning that takes place here,
a deeper, more critical reading of the phenomenon relates to the pursuit of sharing the experience.
Thus, what distinguishes public pedagogy in a digital environment is that the learning does not
simply end with the user’s experience, but that these “lessons” are then pushed out to wider
communities. The consequences of such sharing also require exploration. Beer and Burrows [45]
argue that “web cultures are defined by the consumption of the mundane”, particularly through
social media sites where a range of personal information about the user’s everyday life is often
made readily available. Whilst the criticisms of this may vary, it may be useful to focus on the
explanatory potential of the “confessional society” [25] that such sharing describes, whereby there
is an accompanying obligation to live private lives publicly.
These conditions are inextricable from the rise of the Web 2.0 ethos and the structural principles
that govern these practices. Through a “culture of connectivity” [46], personal lives are organized
around the retrieval and public display of data about a diverse range of aspects of one’s body and
lifestyle. In the process of collecting, visualising, sharing and monitoring such data on one’s body
in a public space, users learn about the body in terms of appropriate forms of maintenance,
development and repair [47]. The blurring of health and these inter-personal communications

37
involves a process of self-presentation online, which is achieved by sharing images and text. Yet,
the public sharing of information and images about one’s body and health, raises questions about
new, potential vulnerabilities, such as online bullying, which has been identified as a particularly
significant risk to children using the Internet in Europe [48]. It is thus particularly important, to
consider the interface between learning via public pedagogy and more formal educational learning,
perhaps making social media education as crucial as religious, drugs, sex, financial or pastoral
education within a national curriculum.
So, the critical approach to public pedagogy espoused here, focused on interrogating broad
dominant discourses, helps us to identify the neoliberal educational forces associated with
consumerism, where commercial platforms introduce “new modes of surveillance” [46]. Certainly,
this work provides central tenets for us to scrutinize technology from a critical perspective,
assisting us in formulating an understanding of the political, social and cultural norms that shape
citizenship through public pedagogy encounters. This is particularly important in the case of
commercial health apps, which contribute to powerful discourses of the body in the context of
consumerism that saturates most online environments [22] (p. 507). However, such interpretations
of mHealth might be indicative of what Savage [33] terms the “enveloping negativity”, which has
plagued public pedagogy.
5. Relationalities of Digital Health Pedagogies
Thus far, we have recognised how public pedagogies of digital health must be located within
perspectives that Sandlin et al. [20] define as propagating “dominant discourses” and reinforcing
the “popular culture and everyday life”. From this understanding, we have highlighted the tendency
to polarise perspectives that may lead us to characterise digital health as wholly serving a
surveillance society, when it does not. Rather, surveillance takes on a new meaning in a digital age,
given the range of complicity that it implies by sharing one’s “quantified self”. Nevertheless, such
perspectives offer important contributions to, for example, examining “the implicit curriculum of
technologically mediated spaces and their public pedagogy” [22] (p. 507). Thus, despite the
absence of explicit learning goals within such informal spaces, they nevertheless foster certain
kinds of learning.
Whilst Giroux’s work has been influential in recent applications of scholarship claiming to focus
on public pedagogy, we must be cautious of appropriating such ideas in a vein that diminishes our
capacity to understand the complexities of “cultures of connectivity” [46]. In this vein, we posit
that, alongside the focus on the “content” and curriculum of digital health pedagogies, one must
also consider the pedagogical relations that frame people’s experiences of health within digital
spaces. Thus, we now turn our attention to the “relational aspects of inhabiting a place and how
these shape subjective experience with the kind of relational encounter that may occur” [49] (p. 57).
Our interpretation of public pedagogy as occurring within informal, digital, social spaces,
captures the pedagogical features of technologically mediated health sites, whose form may be
adequately encapsulated within the term “biopedagogy” [50]. Through this lens, we are able to
make visible the discursive and educational forces, which evoke self-management techniques and
neoliberal practices of the self. However, a focus only on the meanings found within the sites of

38
digital health, and accompanying neoliberal modes of regulation, would be antithetical to our
aspirations to better understand the complex pedagogical processes of these apps from a critical
perspective. This may also leave a number of critical and complex questions unanswered, such as
developing an understanding of the supportive role played by the network within these spaces,
irrespective of what is learned formally about health. Perspectives characterised by visions of
techno-dystopia, therefore, may be troubling in the sense that there is a danger of latent
assumptions of docility present within their readings of technology. As Walkerdine [51] (p. 201)
suggests “a relation between the effectivity of biopower and the subject working on the self, or
resisting, is too simplistic...health works in complex ways to produce subjectivity and that we
cannot just read subjectivity off from biopolitical modes of regulation”. To do so, would be to
invoke a techno-dystopian reading of these modes of regulation.
Whilst users might all experience the discursive organisation of their bodies through health
apps, the public pedagogies we explore here may help us to understand how users experience this
in relation to different “regimes of meaning” [52] which are formed relationally. In this sense, we
may extend these pedagogical notions to consider the different relations of affect circulating
through the intersecting publics that emerge online. In other words, whilst digital health
technologies are the site of regulative discourses and practices, the adoption of these practices is
not simple, nor can it be assumed in the broader readings of public pedagogy. As Ruckenstein
observes, “the ways in which people confront and engage with visualized personal data are as
significant as the technology itself” [24] (p. 69). But more than this, the way people experience
discursive relations within these technologies is in relation to the circulation of affect through
corporeal and prostheticised bodies. At the same time, there are critiques that broad visions of public
pedagogy have been plagued by an “enveloping negativity” [33] through the focus on social
dominance. Against this background, the call by Burdick et al. [26] to consider what our public
pedagogy approach “obfuscates and illuminates” is even more salient in the context of
understanding embodied learning through digital health. In other words, a focus on the biopolitical
may help to define, but also limit, the reach of conceptualisations of embodied learning and the
complexities of the body in digital spaces.
It is not that a focus on dominant discourses fails to provide valuable insight, but rather it we
need be caution of focusing only the content of pedagogy rather than its relational derivation.
Savage [33] warns against such “totalizing and mythologizing” approaches to public pedagogy,
which become all encompassing and through which “popular public pedagogies, therefore, are
reduced to little more than mechanisms for exercising ideological domination” [53] (p. 85). Our
understanding of connectedness of bodies with technologies and other bodies is diminished as a
result of this narrow approach and the potential for understanding the complexities of resistance,
negotiation and contradiction may be obfuscated. In this sense, our critique extends the conceptual
apparatus we bring to public pedagogy to make sense of what happens in mHealth experiences.
To recap, our approach to understanding mHealth rephrases the question of pedagogy in the
context of relationalities. We argue that, rather than focusing only on the politics of digital
health, or on the meanings it produces, we must consider the “complex, moving webs of
interrelationalities” [30]. The importance of this relational approach is further evidenced by the

39
reliance within public pedagogy on an increasingly unsustainable distinction between public and
private [53], which is blurred by digitality. Whilst the commercial intrusion of media has been
recognised elsewhere, web 2.0 technologies further compromise what may be understood as
“private” matters. This presents a number of risks that are broader than those which are typically
associated with life online and to the (re)framing of pedagogical address, as often occurring in
unpredictable ways. Understanding how people learn to recognize themselves and/or others ‘as
good, health, active desirable bodies in the pursuit of “healthiness” within these environments
means avoiding a simple distinction between “virtual” bodies and “offline worlds” or between
public and private spaces.
As Glen Savage observes, this recognition reveals the complexities that arise from intersecting
publics, when conceptualising of public pedagogies of the body [53]. Thus, our task in developing
a critical perspective on mHealth is to understand and identify the extent to which pedagogical
forces extend and “link people together as a public” [53] (p. 80) or as a learning community.
Freishtat and Sandlin [22] (p. 505) suggest that social media can be understood as producing a
habitus, such that a users “experiences with technological culture influence the ways in which they
will interact with technology”. Moreover, an individual’s engagement with their body occurs
dialogically in relation to family, gender and socio-cultural and local contexts, as they engage with
these digital spaces. So, on the one hand, these apps and their accompanying imagery of the
desirable body, engage people with particular body pedagogies, though they are also re-imagined
through local meanings and contexts. This reading of digitality frustrates conceptions of technology
that might position it as ultimately surveillant and disempowering in an absolute sense, rendering
people devoid of critical agency. After all, such perspectives behove us to ask how complex
relationalities are created in these digital environments and how they work across complex and
intersecting ways. In other words, the analytical focus is not simply on the meanings which are
transmitted through body pedagogies. Nor is this to focus attention on those engagements with the
digital that are simply about resistance. Rather, it means focusing on the relationality between
technology, its production and reception as a pedagogical process. The spaces within which this
interaction occurs may mean that surveillance and ideological oppression are stronger. As such,
even where there are evidenced moments of resistance, these may not be as strong as the powerful
forces of surveillance of body pedagogies that may be oppressive, normative or damaging.
6. Public Pedagogy for Disembodied Cyborgs
Many approaches to analysing digital health encounters presume a relatively fixed notion of
selfhood, the body, and corporeality. Yet, we are at a unique moment in human history where the
body is made more complicated by its posthuman technological mediation and prostheticisation.
These circumstances are made apparent in the trajectory towards mobile culture, where the
mundane cyborg is made manifest in the way that mobile devices become extensions of ourselves
and our bodies. Their transformation into wearable technologies like Google Glass and the Oculus
Rift, reveal how biopedogogies are mutating around the hybrid body.
To this end, a final dimension of the public pedagogy approach to digital health requires us to
consider the embodied nature of pedagogy and how that is changing. As Gaztambide-Fernandez

40
and Arraiz-Matute [49] (p. 57) argue, conceptualising technologies as pedagogical means taking
“account of the desires, intentions and conditions that produce them as such”. In this vein,
understanding how and what people learn about their health in technologically mediated
environments means recognising the importance of embodiment in articulations of learning within
theories of public pedagogy:
Public pedagogy articulates this embodied process through which subjectivity is
produced and the politics of this process need to be considered across a broader array of
spaces, texts and through new theoretical assemblages. Embodiment, therefore, cannot
be overlooked in any consideration of the consumption of popular cultural forms [23].
An attempt to define a more embodied and affective understanding of learning is found in
Probyn’s [54] exploration of materiality affects in the classroom and her focus on “what actual
bodies in the classroom do”. In turn, this has given rise to discussions about relationalities between
bodies as an important aspect of pedagogy, but which have yet to be applied to the context of
embodied learning in digital environments. Our intention is not to advance theoretical approaches
occupying the “turn to affect” (see [55,56]). Rather, it is to recognize the importance of applying an
embodied approach to public pedagogies of technologies alongside the important, but broader,
political focus of the dominant discourses of neoliberal regimes of health, the body and citizenship.
Approaching digital health in terms of both its biopolitical and embodied nature enables us to
engage with critical approaches beyond those operating a broader “levels of abstraction” [54] (p. 25).
Inspired by Deleuzian frameworks, such work focuses on the body in terms of capacities and
transformations [57,58] as it is brought into connection with other bodies and technologies [57].
Such conceptualisations are significant insofar as they require us to consider broader ontological
complexities and debates about the virtual body, where the body is considered to be both absent
and present. The disruption to our bodily continuity that follows from life within mobile digital
worlds, requires us to revisit longstanding philosophical and sociological assumptions about what a
“body can do” [54,59,60]. Thus, attending to the relational aspects of “inhabiting (digital health)
spaces” [49], also means understanding the embodied history that is brought to bear on the
affective response one has to new engagements with the body emerging through wearable
technologies, visualisation of data etc.:
What constitutes an affective response is hugely complex, and is in part the result of an
embodied history to which and with which the body reacts, including how the
classroom is conceived and practiced [54] (p. 30).
New sensorial experiences, such as the wearing of fitbit health bands, which vibrate when you
achieve your activity goals, combine different pedagogical forces to produce embodied ways of
knowing. These new knowledges are not just about techniques of the body [40] (p. 70) or users
knowing “how to use their bodies” but also reveal how to use information about their bodies in
accordance with the affective responses to that information. In this sense, we can conceptualise
digital health as existing at the nexus between discourse, affect and pedagogy and through which
subjectivities are constituted as a relationality.

41
In sum, critical analyses of digital health should engage with “considerations of the affective
nature of public, popular and cultural pedagogies” [23] (p. 234). This means a sharper analytic
focus on the emotional exchanges occurring in the social media spaces associated with these health
apps and the affects emerging through interactions between embodied persons, including those that
are constituted as “digital bodies”. The inter-corporeality and “trans-subjectivity” [56] of bodies,
means we cannot think of their presence in digital spaces as singular and bounded. They are
connected to other bodies through digital platforms and with technologies; increasingly so as we
move towards web 3.0 and the Internet of Things. Thus, the prostheticised body occupies spaces of
ambiguity where it is always unfinished and always compelled to improve its digital rendering.
The affective flows of pedagogy in these digital spaces can operate as both power and pleasure.
The Web 2.0 era marks a shift towards health platforms that are oriented around what might be
described as “playful” environments. The mashing up of the quantification of self through the
collection of data about oneself, with creative and game play scenarios, is a recent trend described by
Whitson [35] as “gamification”. This is notable for the way in which “playful frames” are “applied
to non-play spaces” [35] (p. 166). In this way, digital health pedagogies may be experienced as
“play” [35,61,62]. Many contemporary health and fitness apps draw on gamification whereby
“playful frames” are “applied to non-play spaces” such that everyday tasks, such as running,
become more enjoyable or more like a game. Zombie Run is a prominent example of this trend; an
app which combines social media technology with game play situations featuring zombies, as
stated on its website “Join 800,000+ runners on an epic adventure that motivates you to run further
and faster than ever before—whether you’re a beginner or an expert!”. To this extent, such
explanatory concepts reveal how applications engaging with gamification can neither be reduced to
being simply oppressive, nor emancipatory. On the one hand, Zombie Run exhorts individuals to
undertake physical activity and monitor and regulate one’s lifestyle. At the same time, users might
experience more pleasurable aspects of physical activity, such as exploration of local space through
new running routes via the zombie play feature or new routes suggested by running apps. For a
participant of these environments, it may be possible to experience both, at the same time. Other
examples include health apps that use rewards for healthy eating habits. So, through pedagogical
processes like gamification, digital health technologies are normative, regulatory and resistant.
Digital health may therefore present new frames of engagement which can be both enabling and
constraining at the same time. In this sense, digital environments present us with perhaps, multiple
and often contradictory pedagogical forces.
These examples situate health apps in the complex body-machine assemblages through which
bodies enter into complex inter-corporeal affectivity, experiencing pleasure, shame, disgust,
enjoyment. Probyn [54] (p. 26) describes how “affect amplification makes us care about things”.
Many health apps monitor users movements and bodily functions and require users to upload data
wirelessly. Many users have the opportunity to share their data in social media environments,
sharing data or discussing behaviours with others online. The linking of bodies in these spaces is
indicative of bodies entering into entangled processes, and the affective capacities, even where the
corporeal body might not be present. In this sense, rather than simply being shaped by social
influences, bodies entering into these digital assemblages are part of the co-constitutive process.

42
These inter-subjective encounters are a crucial component of public pedagogy, where “subjects
come into relationship and influence each other” [31,49]. Perhaps crucially, one of the questions
that arises from this is “whose desires and intentions are enacted and imposed pedagogically and to
what end…who is it we want people to become” [49] (p. 59).
7. Conclusions
This paper has outlined a critical approach to understanding digital health in the context of
theories of public pedagogy. It began by arguing on behalf of a public pedagogy approach, before
setting out some of the formal parameters of this that are most suited to an analysis of digital health
encounters. In so doing, we have outlined differences within public pedagogy theory and highlighted
how “theories of “pedagogy writ large” have the potential to provide diverse traditions with a
mediating concept between the production of knowledge or ideology and the normative power it
exercises” [23] (p. 234). We went on to outline how public pedagogy approaches draw attention to
the neoliberal governance of the body, which occurs through digital health encounters. However,
we also acknowledge the limitation of this broad vision of public pedagogy, which can obfuscate
the various ways in which multiple pedagogic forces intersect, which is particularly prominent
within virtual worlds. As such, we present a conceptual framework for public pedagogy that takes
into account the limitations of a focus on digitality as popular culture at the broadest level. This
approach emphasises more complex processes that operate around crucial categorical distinctions,
such as between the virtual and non-virtual, the individual and the community, public and private,
and formal or informal educational structures. We have also acknowledge the changing conditions
of embodiment that arise from a trajectory towards greater digitalization, where “online bodies
are bodies that are certainly being written, but simultaneously bodies to write on” [63] (p. 229).
In the digital apps we describe, users are not merely the “machine parts” [63] (p. 219) of the
human–computer interface, but are made “more autonomous” [63] through their “symbiotic
relationship to machines” [63].
There is a lack of research on individual’s experiences of these technologies, particularly in
terms of the implications for “embodiment, selfhood and social relationships” [5] (p. 299). The
intention here has been to recognize the importance of applying an embodied nature of pedagogy
alongside broader political focus of public pedagogy [34] to better understand how digital health
encounters take place. Making the body more central to conceptualizations of public pedagogies of
technology, while attending to the political and affective dimensions of technological relationships,
ensures a more critical understanding of what occurs in digital health, since it does not neglect how
the relational dimensions of networked experiences brings an additional pedagogic layer, beyond
the content. This approach provides a useful way of negotiating the polarisations between utopian
and dystopian views of digital health, but it does not ignore or diminish the aspirations or anxieties that
arise from these views.

Practicing Patienthood Online:
Social Media, Chronic Illness, and Lay Expertise
Collette Sosnowy
Abstract: The use of digital technologies and social media by people with serious illness to find,
share, and create health information is much celebrated but rarely critiqued. Proponents laud
“Health 2.0” as transforming health care practice and empowering patients. Critics, however, argue
that a discourse of developing lay expertise online masks the disciplinary practices of the neoliberal
state’s emphasis on individual responsibility. Notably, the perspectives of people who are engaging
with social media related to their health and illness are under-represented in this debate. This
research examines the experiences and perspectives of women who blog about their lives with
Multiple Sclerosis in order to situate them in the context of these conflicting ideologies. Methods
consisted of an ethnographic content analysis (N = 40), an online survey (n = 20), and an online
discussion forum (n = 9). Findings revealed that blogging is neither inherently empowering nor
inevitably disciplinary. Rather, it simultaneously offers opportunities for patients to gain medical
knowledge and resist medical patriarchy, as well as compounds expectations placed upon patients
to assume greater responsibility for managing their care.

1. Introduction
Social media platforms facilitate the sharing of health information between users and the
co-creation of new knowledge that is shaped by personal experience. As such, they are a unique
location to read narratives of women’s experiences with illness because they provide insight
into lived experience as told through a public forum. Social media can provide important spaces
for people with illness to build community, engage in activism, and enact resistance. Numerous
studies document the perceived benefits of using social media and being part of online illness
communities [1–11], opportunities for people to find information and develop medical
knowledge [12–17], and challenge medical expertise [18]. Ziebland and Wyke [19] identified
multiple domains through which online activity can affect health, several of which fulfill social
needs, such as connecting to others and narrating experience. They argue that the appeal of hearing
about others’ first hand experiences as well as the ability to contribute to and construct medical
knowledge are important components of seeking health information online. Certainly, social media
applications are a key facilitator for these activities.
Skepticism of the internet as a reliable source of health information and resistance from some
health care providers have lessened considerably since early widespread adoption of the medium [19].
Applications like blogging are now helping to facilitate a shift in patients’ roles [15,17,20–26] in
which they are increasingly both enabled and expected to develop lay expertise about their illness
and treatment, including seeking and sharing health information online through interactive

48
networks. Equally, practitioners are supposed to encourage these activities and welcome patients
as partners in care [27]. People with illness who use social media are often portrayed as
technologically-empowered citizens who actively strive to participate in their care, collaborate with
providers, educate themselves and others about their illness, and self-manage their care.
While laypeople have initiated many of these social media practices, the health care industry has
further promoted them as part of a model of participatory patient-hood that has the potential to
“revolutionize” health care by accelerating knowledge development and contributing to advances
in research, ultimately improving treatments and outcomes. Many companies, organizations, and
agencies in the public and private sectors of the health care industry have rushed to position
themselves in the social media landscape in order to market, shape, and influence their sectors of
the economy as well as influence policy. They use the internet to promote a discourse that
participation in social media is inherently empowering and that patient engagement via this media
will dramatically shift health care for the collective benefit. Examples can be found on the websites
of health insurance companies, advocacy organizations, and other industry stakeholders that feature
patients who blog or appear in video presentations talking about their personal experiences with
illness and treatment. While these profiles highlight the significant experiential knowledge patients
have acquired and developed on their own, they also imply that taking on this role is inherently
empowering rather than a product of necessary labor.
Critics, on the other hand, argue that this vision of participatory patient-hood, which incorporates a
discourse of individual responsibility that is characteristic of neoliberalism, masks disciplinary
practices of the state. As Foucault [28] conceived, discipline of the citizen is achieved in part
through the indirect means of guiding individuals to discipline themselves. Drawing from
Foucault’s technologies of the self. Rose [29] argues that under neoliberalism, a political, social,
and cultural ideal of an “enterprising self” who strives toward an idealized conception of the citizen
reproduces the reductive effects of neoliberalism. More specifically, this conception has come to
include using internet applications to acquire and share information in order to direct, manage, and
improve one’s health. In framing these practices as acts of choice, the shifting of responsibility
from the collective to the individual is simultaneously celebrated and downplayed.
While neoliberalism is fundamentally opposed to collectivism, the potentials of social media to
collect massive amounts of data and influence large numbers of people provide another venue
through which to discipline and profit from citizens. Individuals are encouraged to donate personal
health information and labor in the name of furthering medical innovation, thus benefitting the
greater population. Meanwhile, both the health care industry and the state profit directly and
indirectly from their efforts. A discourse of health activism reorganizes collectivism and turns it
around so that it is no longer an oppositional practice, but a cooperation between public, proprietary,
and personal interests. The promotion of using social media to conduct and maintain self-disciplinary
practices can also be seen as reproducing structural inequalities by deflecting attention away from
the inadequacies of the state and industry to care equally for its citizens and by excluding people
who cannot or choose not to practice participatory patient-hood.
Lost between the divergent viewpoints of industry advocates and academic critics, however, are
the voices of people who are engaging with social media related to their health and illness. They

49
blur the boundaries between these ideological distinctions through their lived experience with
illness. In practice, patients must negotiate between these perceived opportunities and obligations
to meet their needs. This research focuses on the social media of blogs as narratives about life with
chronic illness, in order to understand how blogging is a forum through which these negotiations
are related and practiced.
2. Situating Social Media in Health Discourse
Miller and Pole credit the user-generated content characteristic of a more interactive online
environment with being responsible for the rapid growth in health-related content online and call
blogging the “quintessential Web 2.0 application” [12] (p. 1514). Digital technologies and social
media have become so integrated in shaping a new cultural paradigm of health care that some in
the industry have coined the term “Health 2.0”, which Sarasohn-Kahn defines as “the use of social
software and its ability to promote collaboration between patients, their caregivers, medical
professionals, and other stakeholders in health” [22] (p. 2). Eytan best describes the concept’s
ideological goals and discourse:
Health 2.0 is participatory healthcare. Enabled by information, software, and community
that we collect or create, we the patients can be effective partners in our own
healthcare, and we the people can participate in reshaping the health care system [30].
Such impassioned and enthusiastic discourse found in the quote above is common among
advocates of this approach, illustrated here by such terms as “partners”, “reshaping”, and even “we
the people”.
The ideologies behind Health 2.0 need further examination. Writing about personal data-reporting
online, Levina [31] argues that donating information via online social networks creates the
perception that “active patient citizens” align themselves with acts of rebellion against the
traditional medical patriarchy that seeks to maintain control of health information and expertise.
However, this idea can obfuscate problematic aspects, particularly the ethical implications of who
else benefits from this freely-given data, that is, the companies that sell it. Rose and Novas argue
that the state constructs patients as “biological citizens” whose bodies are the sites of neoliberal
“citizenship projects”. They argue that “activism and responsibility have now become not only
desirable but virtually obligatory” [32] (p. 451) to fulfilling the patient’s idealized role as equal
participant. These expectations are partially the product of public and private institutions that seek
to discipline citizens by constructing personal responsibility as a moral imperative, and an act of
empowerment and autonomy. Salmon and Hall note that the discourse of empowerment “clearly
connects with the wider political and cultural emphasis on individual autonomy and rights that is
helping the state shed the responsibility for individuals that citizens had come to expect” [27] (p. 55).
3. Critiquing the Information-as-Empowerment Narrative
Assumptions that access to information allows patients opportunities for empowerment and
better care are embedded in the construction of participatory patient-hood. However, as Wathen
and Harris describe, critics question the clinical value of the information-as-empowerment model

50
and whether these policies and practices are of greater benefit to the patient or the health
care system:
“Accompanying the current discourse on health care reform, in which terms such as
patient empowerment and self-care often appear, is the assumption that health-informed
individuals will participate, alongside their health care providers, in a process of shared
decision making. Ultimately, the logic follows, informed empowered patients will take
responsibility for their health, including managing their health care” [14] (p. 640,
emphasis in the original).
The authors note that these assumptions may be inconsistent with patients’ desires to shoulder
these responsibilities. Furthermore, their research suggests that access to information alone is
unlikely to fill in for important care relationships. In interviews with rural Canadian women about
their health information-seeking experiences, they found that participants repeatedly focused on the
quality of their relationship to the people they turned to for help and information. They concluded
that “the perceived effectiveness of these health information intermediaries seemed to depend largely
on how well they expressed care and concern during the information exchange” [15]. Similarly,
Salmon and Hall argue that “patients value being given information as a way of building relationships
with clinicians and maintaining hope—not as a basis for decision-making” [27] (p. 53).
Several scholars [6,27,33] have argued that the transitions in both discourse and practice are the
product of consumer society and its impact on health care. Kopelson [33] maps the transition of the
internet-informed patient from nuisance to expert, partner, and manager of their illness and notes
that the latest iteration is becoming a prescriptive norm that crowds out other ideologies and
behaviors. This is accomplished by creating and recruiting the ideal patient, and portraying those
who do not conform as failed consumers who elect not to engage in the enterprising practices of
information-seeking and body discipline. The result is a “felt imperative” [34] to enact these
behaviors and adopt its goals. Salmon and Hall argue that the idea of empowerment through
information is not generated by patients but by those it benefits—providers and, by extension, the
health care industry. By not interrogating assumptions about empowerment, providers may be
unaware that they are “redrawing the boundaries of medicine” [27] (p. 55) in a way that is
burdensome to the patient.
Distinctions between proponents and critics of the participatory e-patient discourse are made
more ambiguous by the intersections between the individual patient’s interests and the interests of
other stakeholders. For example, pharmaceutical companies benefit from developing and selling
the hugely expensive drugs required to treat MS, yet patients need and benefit from them.
Advocacy organizations such as the National MS Society, which are often focused on raising
money for further research, have closely aligned interests with, and often receive funding from
pharmaceutical companies, but rarely disclose these relationships [35]. However, their efforts may
help develop better treatments. Substantial resources are poured into consumer education efforts,
both by the state through public health campaigns, and by the insurance, pharmaceutical, and
hospital industry as cost-effective strategies, yet they provide the individual with important
information. These industries have embraced the use of social media, in part, to promote a model of

51
patient-hood that increases their profitability, yet individuals may feel empowered by using social
media to engage in their health care.
The argument that the demands placed on the patients in the current political economy are
necessarily burdensome is flawed when applied to the more nuanced experience of being a patient.
As I demonstrate in my argument, some patients genuinely feel empowered by their increased
ability to be more knowledgeable and more participatory in their care, even as they recognize the
burdens and constraints placed on them. While there may be little they can do to influence change
in an abstract and unwieldy health care system, they can acquire more skills that help them to
negotiate it to their best advantage. This paper argues for a most nuanced understanding of using
social media to develop and share knowledge and personal experiences. The political implications
of greater patient participation—which both challenges and contributes to medical knowledge and
practice—remain significant but are increasingly less novel. Looking at the everyday experience of
patients that have chosen to enact this role, as this study does, reveals the ways in which the larger
cultural discourse of this model of patient-hood are lived.
4. Methods
This mixed-methods study focused on American women with Multiple Sclerosis who regularly
maintained journal-style personal blogs about their lives. Data consisted of three phases: an
ethnographic content analysis of 40 blogs (N = 40), an online survey of the bloggers (n = 20), and
an online discussion forum with bloggers (n = 9) for a period of 5 weeks, all explained in greater
detail below. Chronic illness such as MS requires daily negotiations with often-unpredictable
symptoms over the lifespan. I chose to focus on chronic illness because I wanted to broaden the
literature about online illness narratives and health discourse. There is a substantial body of work
on cancer-related (especially breast cancer) blogs, online communities, and online advocacy and
activism that lays a groundwork for the study of online illness narrative [2–7,11,36], but less
research has examined different types of illness.
The nature of the internet as a continually-changing forum opens up new perspectives and
arguments for methodological and ethical approaches. Because it is a relatively new field of academic
study, fewer standard practices have been established for protecting human participants than for
traditional fieldwork. A great deal of internet research includes collecting and analyzing content or
observing user behavior without individuals knowing they are being included in research.
Hutchinson [37] outlined three schools of thought about using personal online content for research
without permission, even when it is publicly-accessible: (1) publicly available information is public
and therefore should be able to be researched without explicit permission [38,39]; (2) personal
information, such as blog entries and comments, while public, are personal and should be treated as
private [40–42]; and (3) the Internet is “publicly-private and privately-public” [43] (p. 131) and
should be treated with a balanced approach. The blurring between public and private that is
characteristic of social media make a strong case for the latter.
This study was deemed by the IRB to be low-risk and I chose to take a balanced approach by
making two of the three phrases participatory. This was not simply to address ethical concerns, but
also because participatory research was a primary goal of this project. I sought to elicit bloggers’

52
voices directly, put them in conversation with each other, and ask them to consider specific topics
and questions. I determined that the blogs I included in this study, while personal, were intended to
be read by a wide audience. In addition to documenting their personal experience, bloggers often
wrote about Multiple Sclerosis advocacy efforts, and shared information and advice. There were
also some visible interactions between bloggers and commenters, indicating a willing engagement
with a public audience. To protect participants’ identities, survey responses were anonymous, and
the discussion took place on an invitation-only, password-protected platform. Furthermore, I asked
discussion participants to choose their own usernames and emphasized that I would use these when
I referred to or quoted them individually, as I do here.
Three phases were conducted over a period of three months.
Phase 1. An ethnographic content analysis of 40 blogs. In conducting an analysis of blog
content, which included text, graphics, images, and video, I used Altheide’s methodology of
ethnographic content analysis. This approach involves:
Emergent and theoretical sampling of documents from information bases (including
those developed by a researcher, e.g., field notes), development of a protocol for more
systematic analysis, and then constant comparisons to clarify themes, frames, and
discourse [44].
Following an overall reading of the blogs using this approach, I conducted a more detailed
analysis of 78 posts (in most cases, two per blog). These were selected by choosing two dates and
analyzing the most recent post.
Phase 2. An online survey. I sent an anonymous online survey to all 40 bloggers from Phase 1
and received 20 responses. With the survey I sought to understand participants’ blogging practices
and the role blogging played in their lives and experience with illness. I asked respondents to
provide an email address if they were interested in further participation and invited all who did to
take part in an online discussion forum.
Phase 3. An online discussion forum. Nine bloggers participated in a private online discussion
forum for a period of five weeks. This method directly solicited the perspective of the bloggers
and provided them an opportunity to connect with other bloggers who write about having MS.
Three overlapping themes were explored over the course of the discussion: (1) being a part of the
MS “blogosphere” and feelings of connection to other bloggers or other people with MS; (2)
expectations of patients by the medical establishment to be participatory patients; and (3) the blend
between their online and offline experiences.
I used a grounded theory approach [45] for analysis. This approach allows hypotheses,
categories and conceptual codes, and themes to emerge from the data collection and analysis. In
this approach, sampling is aimed toward theory construction, not representativeness. I analyzed
data using a method of “open-coding” followed by “focused-coding” [46]. I categorized data based
on the major themes that had arisen from initial reading of the text and descriptive statistics, such
as medical knowledge or interactions with healthcare providers, and motivations for blogging. I
then identified recurrent patterns and sub-themes, such as a specific focus on neurologists, or a love
of writing.

53
For the purposes of this article, I limit the analysis of findings to Phase 3 and focus on how
bloggers developed and shared medical knowledge and utilized it in their care.
5. Developing Lay Health Knowledge
Inevitably, patients are constrained by their need for health care and a relative lack of influence
over an unwieldy medical bureaucracy. Facing such odds, they are left with little choice but to
navigate their way through the system, advocating for themselves and their families as best as they
can. Findings from this study revealed that while the disease itself was most often seen as an
unwelcome burden, both the opportunity and necessity to become a participatory e-patient was not
necessarily seen in the same light. Most of the discussion participants saw it as providing
opportunities for them to feel more in control of their life with illness. Participant “funkymango”
wrote, “I want to be a partner in my healthcare. It’s my body, so if it’s down to choosing between
two meds (for instance) I want to be involved in the decision-making.” These findings contradict
Salmon and Hall’s [27] suggestion that the construction of patient empowerment is not often
experienced as such. These participants, at least, did desire to be informed and have the ability and
option to influence their treatment. This is perhaps not surprising from a set of participants who
were already actively seeking and sharing information online and may be more likely to take this
view than people who do not engage in these behaviors. Nevertheless, this finding demonstrates
that while interrogating the assumptions and vocabulary of medical discourse is important, as
Salmon and Hall [27] did 10 years ago, we need to revisit these questions in the context of a newer
media landscape where social interactions online are easy, ubiquitous, and integrated with lived
experience. Furthermore, a discourse of empowerment has become even more embedded in our
cultural conceptions of health care practice and patient-hood through social media.
While participants in this study saw these opportunities as benefits, they also didn’t feel they had
much of a choice if they wanted to be certain they were getting the best care and outcomes
possible. Participant “turtlespeed” highlighted this contradiction when she stated, “I like being an
informed patient but it does make for a lot more work. I guess I kinda feel that it is just part of
being a patient. You need to be able to understand what is going on so you can advocate for your
care.” Bloggers developed medical knowledge through their own efforts at self-educating, but they
also assumed the role of lay expert by choosing to share and discuss this information on their blog
and interacting with others online. Many of the participants considered themselves educators and
translators of complex medical information and blogs provided a wide-reaching forum for their
work. As a result, they saw themselves as having a responsibility to readers to provide accurate and
up-to-date information that was supported by scientific research. In addition to carefully crediting
sources, bloggers were careful to make clear distinctions between research-based expert knowledge
and their personal experiences.
In the discussion, participant “sheltiemom” described the benefits and risks associated with
using the internet to get information when she wrote, “we do have to be careful because while the
internet can be helpful there is alot of Crap info out there also. It seems everybody has some crazy
cure for MS.” In response, “funkymango” wrote “This is so true…I think this puts some

54
responsibility on us as MS bloggers/bloggers about MS to make sure the information we give is
accurate.” Similarly, “sherri” warned:
There are bloggers out there who do their own “research” and draw their own
conclusions, then go and post it as medical based knowledge. This is very dangerous. If
a newly diagnosed or very naïve person reads the information as legitimate, they might
face some problems.…I think that being a personal blogger carries some responsibility
but not near as much as someone who is blogging and calling it research…those
research based bloggers should be held to a much higher level of responsibility
and standard.
Personal accounts of a blogger’s experience were seen as equally helpful, if not more so, than
research-based information. For “sherri”, other bloggers’ personal experiences were the most
helpful to her because they supplemented the information she received from her doctor or
researched herself, and allowed her learn from others’ experiences with the disease. She wrote that
on some of the blogs she read:
…there was no declaration of fact—only personal stories. In my mind, these were the
best sources of information for me. I could compare what I was reading on personal
sites to research or things my [neurologist] had said, which helped me understand
the disease.
For her, both kinds of information were seen as equally valid and complemented each other.
Making a clear distinction between professional and lay expertise highlighted this symbiosis, rather
than simply privileging professional expertise. Developing knowledge about the biological
functions of MS provided a context in which to place the embodied experience of the disease, but
the most intimate knowledge of the disease came from living with it. Bloggers often described
daily experiences—descriptions of symptoms, notable incidents like a fall, accommodating daily
routines due to fatigue, or pushing oneself too hard—rather than, or in addition to, research-based
information. This embodied knowledge was acquired over time, and linked with the medical
knowledge they learned from formal sources.
Not surprisingly, health care providers, specifically neurologists, played a significant role in
bloggers’ lives, even when actual encounters were infrequent. This significance was not only
important to the physical treatment of the disease, but to their emotional experience as well.
Encounters and relationships with medical providers were most often described in polarized terms:
either positive experiences or negative/contentious experiences, suggesting that these relationships
are highly charged. These important relationships were negotiated between what bloggers expected
of themselves as patients and what they expected of their neurologists. In addition to wanting to be
knowledgeable enough to be part of decision-making about their care, they wanted doctors who
considered and respected their knowledge. This is consistent with Wathen and Harris’s [15], and
Salmon and Hall’s [27] findings about the importance of the quality of relationships in receiving
health information.
Bloggers’ ability to fill the role of self-advocate and partner in their care was not one-sided. It
was also partly contingent on healthcare providers meeting the patients’ expectations. The bloggers

55
expected their doctors to respect them as people, treat them as knowledgeable patients, and to care
about them. Likewise, their satisfaction with healthcare providers was largely dependent on how
well providers fulfilled these expectations. When a provider did not, bloggers usually found a new
one who did. While most bloggers assumed that their neurologists were well-qualified, those who
did not meet expectations for a caring and respectful relationship were usually described as having
a patronizing attitude and resistant to patient input. While bloggers wanted to be considered a
partner in their care, they also sought to maintain the distinction between professional expertise and
the lay expertise they developed from personal experience and wanted their health care providers to
be more knowledgeable and able to guide them in decision-making.
Participant “ellie”, a former physical therapist, said that she was “treated [respectfully] as a
person with knowledge” by doctors most of the time. She enacted the role of participatory patient
by maintaining a chart of her health, which she brought with her to doctors’ visits. However, she
wrote, “even though I am and want to be a knowledgeable partner I need him to be a caring MD”.
She described a recent appointment, in which her doctor was attentive and supportive, and wrote
“he was my physician and I was his patient...and that’s what I needed at that time”. Likewise,
“katewj” also described feeling the need to direct her own care: “my treatment is very much ‘in
silos’ and I have to be the communicator who thinks to ask one specialist about the effects
generated by another”. She also wrote “I want to be an empowered, informed patient AND I hope
for doctors who are more informed than I.” Several bloggers described feelings of satisfaction from
being included in decision-making, such as “sherri” who wrote, “he gives me his opinion, allows
me to research things, and then together we make decisions about what is going to be next”.
In contrast, participant “sheltiemom” described a neurologist who had a “‘go home sit on the
couch and die’ attitude”. Fortunately, she was able to switch to a doctor who was more proactive
and receptive to her participation. A few bloggers, however, had either not been able to switch to a
new neurologist or had switched but still not found one they were happy with. “grace2wheel”
described “an endless battle with doctors who have too much power over my access to medical care
as well as the all important disability insurance. To be blunt, I dread seeing my neurologist.”
“marie” wrote that she been to three neurologists in her local area:
The neurologists have been mostly arrogant and close-minded, needing to be in control
and, locally, out of date with treatment protocols. Very threatened by any suggestions
of knowledge by me, the patient.…It is very disheartening, as a patient with a chronic
disease, to feel you are not understood or respected as an intelligent, informed adult.
While patients are enabled to be well-informed about their illness, the inherent power structures
in health care still limit their role to contributing information to the provider’s expertise. The extent
to which their knowledge, experience, and desire can help direct their care, however, is partly
contingent on their medical providers sharing their ethos.
6. Limitations of the Study
Much internet-based research, particularly early studies, relied heavily on unobtrusive
observation by researchers and while observation is a rich source of data, I believe that connective

56
media calls for participatory methods. With this in mind, I solicited the perspectives of bloggers
directly in order to better understand their experiences as they saw them and chose to write about.
In addition, by using three distinct methods (an ethnographic content analysis, an online survey,
and an online discussion), I approached the topic from multiple vantage points.
As with all methods, however, these three had some limitations. In studying public blogs, I
chose subjects who openly share their personal viewpoint. This means that my findings are specific
to the small minority of American women with MS who blog publicly, and don’t represent the
hundreds of thousands of women with MS who do not. However, drawing on the support of
literature about online illness communities [1–11], I found similar themes about living with illness
(such as describing the disruption caused by illness and strategies for working around limitations).
It is reasonable to assume that some commonality is shared by bloggers and non-bloggers alike.
As public bloggers, these women may be more comfortable sharing their thoughts and stories
and be predisposed to participate in a research project compared to private bloggers or non-bloggers.
A certain amount of self-selection probably contributed to the willingness and enthusiasm of the
nine bloggers who elected to participate in the online discussion. Nonetheless, this study adds
important voices and the themes could be extrapolated to other contexts.
7. Conclusions
Being a participatory patient who uses digital tools to acquire, share, and develop knowledge
is neither inherently empowering, nor does it shift an undue burden onto the patient. It offers
opportunities to feel empowered by acquiring information and connecting with others. It is also
undeniably a laborious practice that has become a more common expectation by both patients
themselves and the health care industry to take full advantage of the large amount of information
made available through easily-accessible networks. In this study, it is clear that the practice of
utilizing digital and networked tools, is accompanied by other social practices such as fostering
community and mutual support, and negotiating medical relationships.
Overall, the bloggers viewed the idea of being knowledgeable about the disease and having an
active role in decision making and treatments positively. They also viewed it as their responsibility
if they wanted to feel equipped to engage with their medical providers and make decisions.
Participant “sheltiemom” implied that ease of access to information via the internet did place some
responsibility on the patient when she wrote “I don’t think our doctors expect us to be educated but
most probably appreciate it if we are. In this world where info is easier to access on the internet it is
important for us all to be our own advocate and be informed.”
Americans continue to go to their health providers for information first [13] and many view their
use of the internet to find information as supplemental to their primary care [16]. In this study,
participants talked about conducting online research in preparation for a health care visit. This
neutralizes claims that access to health information de-centralizes health care practice or, as Health
2.0 proponents suggest, revolutionizes it altogether. Rather, using the internet and social media to
acquire, share, and create health knowledge expands the reach of information. It increases the
participation of some patients and further normalizes resistance toward patriarchal medical practice
as a whole, but is unlikely to unseat primary health care providers as central figures in care.

57
The findings of this study demonstrate that blogging is a simultaneously empowering and disciplinary
set of practices. The same mechanisms reproduce these practices, namely authoring public
narratives about lived experience with illness and the consumption, generation, and dissemination
of knowledge by patients. While blogging reproduces the discourse of self-responsibility and body
governance, it also gives voice to experiences, which can empower the patient to challenge the
dominant power structure upon which contemporary medicine is constructed and redirect narratives
of illness and disability. Likewise, the practices of self-educating, producing experiential
knowledge, reporting data, and disseminating knowledge can provide the patient with information
that can be used to help treat their condition and which may give them a sense of greater agency.
In enacting these practices both by blogging and through blogging, these study participants
create and shape a mediated space through which to practice participatory patient-hood. Critical
concerns of how political, social, and cultural norms are scripted onto the body, suggest a passive
patient, unaware or unconcerned with the forces working on her. Feminist theorists have sought to
counter these assumptions by calling attention to how these forces are experienced [6,47]. Indeed,
the participants in my study were very much aware of the interest in their bodies by a number of
institutions: a health care system that simultaneously tries to treat, care for, regulate, profit from,
and deny care to them; a state that reluctantly supports them with often too-meager resources; and a
political and socio-cultural framework that constructs them as disabled and generates and
reproduces a discourse of illness within which they negotiate their lives. This study has revealed
that participatory patient-hood is contradictory: the burdens and expectations that are placed on
them may be welcomed by patients for whom more information helps them manage the everyday
realities of living with chronic illness and navigate the systems in which they have little choice but
to participate.

“Maternal Devices”, Social Media and the Self-Management
of Pregnancy, Mothering and Child Health
Sophia Alice Johnson
Abstract: In recent years the smartphone has revolutionised lay people’s management of health
and illness, particularly in regards to pregnancy and parenting. This article analyses smartphone
applications, or apps, and social media platforms as mediating technologies which act as performative
devices. These devices encourage particular enactments of subjectivity and technologies of the self
which combine the expert patient ideal with ideologies of mothering. Some apps and social media
can be disciplinary and invoke biological responsibility in various ways including the monitoring
of specific behaviours via “push responsibilisation”. Apps claim to allow for greater convenience,
connectivity, flexibility, efficiency, and what will be characterised in this article as the
“tidbitisation” of information. This article suggests the ways in which health-conscious pregnant or
maternal subjects are likely to view apps and social media sites as a means to improve and monitor
their pregnancies, health, and their children’s development and health.

1. Introduction
The smartphone revolution over the past five years has had a significant impact on our lives,
influencing our daily activities in varied ways. One of the most important influences has been the
continuing technological expansion of the management of health and illness, which is now
incorporated into many people’s smartphones via a range of applications, integrating anything from
calorie counters to exercise trainers. Smartphone applications (“apps”) and social media platforms
are important elements in the rapidly changing environment around pregnancy and the transition to
first-time motherhood. Despite much theoretical research highlighting significant changes in digital
health technologies, studies analysing these technologies, their possible implications and the
experiences of users are few. 1 This article begins to address this gap in the literature by analysing
smartphone apps and social media platforms that are coming to play a role in the everyday practices
of the maternal subject.
Pregnancy and mothering are no longer seen as simply a reading assignment [6]. In the context
of an increasingly digitalised world, the transition to first-time motherhood is now an embodied
project which encompasses digital health, responsible biocitizenship, accessing the internet as a
source for support and advice and the use of a range of new devices, changing the way pregnancy
and mothering are understood and practiced. Together, these developments promise to make

Specifically there has been very little research on the use and impacts of smartphone apps and social media as they
are used as part of pregnancy and parenting practices. At the time of writing there were very few academic papers
on this topic [1–5].

62
maternity a self-calculable exercise in data management. In this article, I consider how apps and
social media platforms organise parenting practice and have the potential to produce new
experiences of pregnancy and motherhood. In contemporary culture’s emphasis on choice,
individualism and empowerment smartphone apps and social media are an increasingly important
object of analysis, through which we could study changing relationships towards technological
devices and new patterns of behaviour, understood in this article as technologies of the self [7–9].
2. Maternal Subjects as Expert Patients
The personal management of health is an avenue through which individuals can embrace their
duties and responsibilities as “good citizens” and ethical selves [10–12]. In an age of increasing
digitalisation individuals have unprecedented access to a huge range of health information and one of
the consequences of this access is that one feels the imperative to present as, or be, an “expert
patient” [13–15]. The expert patient is expected to negotiate their healthcare with careful research and
self-education. Research on the expert patient is most often focused on patients with chronic disease
such as obesity [14,16] or cancer [15]. It has, however, important implications for understanding
women’s experiences as maternal subjects, particularly their use of technology in the management of
maternal and foetal health.
Maternal subjects, as expert patients, are expected to adopt a highly reflexive, intentional and
carefully researched orientation to the consumer market catering to pregnancy and parenting [11].
This expectation is combined with ideologies of motherhood, such as intensive mothering. According
to Hays, intensive mothering: “requires not only large quantities of money but also
professional-level skills and copious amounts of physical, moral, mental, and emotional energy on
the part of the individual mother” [17] (p. 4). Immediately we recognise the dictates of expert
patient and intensive mothering share many features and thus combine to form a particularly
powerful technology of the self [7–9]. The intertwined roles of mother and expert patient therefore
serve to emphasise personal responsibility over making the “right” choices for your child. This is a
central consideration in this article as I analyse how the development of specific apps impacts on
the relationship between the expert patient ideal and contemporary mothering ideology.
3. “Being-for-Intimate-Others”
A growing body of literature reveals the various ways the foetal and infant body are positioned
in popular media and medical and public health discourses in order to encourage maternal
responsibility [18–22]. In neoliberal society, women turn to a range of technologies and systems
of expertise and guidance in order to manage the risks, pressures and challenges characteristic
of the transition to first-time motherhood. In doing so, women undertake specific pregnant and
maternal practices to ensure the health and well-being of the foetus and infant. These practices can
be defined according to Foucault’s [9] notion of technologies or practices of the self. In Foucault’s
account, technologies of the self are not coercively directed but are encouraged by the enhancement
and pragmatic actualisation of general moral goals and aspirations which may include desires,
pleasures, happiness and good health [23]. Technologies of the self therefore reveal the multiplicity

63
of ways in which dominant discourses may be enacted, resisted, negotiated or differentially
embodied in the individual’s ongoing ethical project of the self. This analytic frame enables us to
identify variations in how individuals or groups of individuals might constitute themselves as
subjects of given moral injunctions.
With the growing standardisation of medical technologies and interventions, pre-pregnant
couples, pregnant couples and parents actively consume and demand these in order to optimise
outcomes, in the process incorporating risk avoidance as a technology of the self. Maternal subjects
may therefore embrace medicalisation as part of their desire for the best possible outcomes in
reproductive, foetal and infant health [8,24–26]. As more technologies offer more opportunities to
optimise foetal health outcomes, “the choice not to choose” appears selfish as this stands as a
denial of “the best care” available [27]; [28] (p. 2). It is at this juncture that the responsibilisation of
individuals in the neoliberal context becomes something more for maternal subjects as they are not
simply acting for the self but also for the unborn “other”. Thus, I argue that responsibilisation for
maternal subjects is both gendered and double-pronged; this is not simply neoliberal responsibilisation
as we know it, but responsibilisation of the self-for-others; “being-for-intimate-others”. This gendering
of responsibilisation is also implicit in the ideology of intensive mothering which argues that mothers
must do everything possible, including self-sacrifice, for the sake of their children [17].
The immersion in numerous media forms aids in the self-education of individuals and also
allows them to engage in “biomedical self-shaping” [29] (p. 446) where patients actively make
choices regarding their genetic and corporeal responsibility, acting on and disciplining themselves
according to expert recommendations. 2 I attempt to move beyond Rose and Novas’s [29] work on
“biomedical self-shaping” to demonstrate the ways in which devices such as smartphone apps and
social media could be utilised by pregnant women and new mums as they engage in the project of
first-time motherhood. I have already suggested that the convergence of the ideologies of intensive
mothering and the expert patient ideal work to create a powerful technology of the self for maternal
subjects. I consider whether we can now add the technology of smartphone apps to this nexus,
potentially attaching new rules, meanings and dynamics to the ethical project encompassing
pregnancy and motherhood (and instituting these rules through their incorporation into devices).
Are smartphone apps and social media platforms simply disciplinary devices, or do they do
something more? Are they also performative and if so, what sort of pregnant or maternal subject
are they producing? Do women utilise social media and apps to engage with the ideal of the expert
patient, the intensive mother or some other ideology of mothering?
4. The “Device-ification” of Maternal Subjects
The integration of apps and other smartphone technologies into everyday life, routines, and
definitions of the self illuminates the ongoing dynamic nature of biological citizenship,
representing a new development in self-health practices that adherence to self-help guidebooks
alone would not afford in the same sort of way. This article explores some of the possibilities
2

Descriptions of self-identity increasingly include “biologically colored languages” [30] (p. 73) which demonstrate
active relationships with medical and scientific authorities and products.

64
associated with this notion of “device-ification”. Apps and social media platforms are able to be
integrated into every-day life via the portability of smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices.
The employment of such devices suggest a specific way of producing (self-)knowledge of the
pregnant body and offer ways in which women can understand or define their pregnancies and/or
mothering practices. They could also work to encourage women to evaluate themselves according
to various prenatal norms thus allowing them to measure how good or bad their specific practices
are deemed to be.
These new technologies are not simply an extension of more static forms of self-help (such as
guidebooks) as devices or technologies of the self, but represent a transformation of these. This
material development is important. It allows people to relate to what used to be a book via a new
set of instructions or practices through a device in a variety of locations and even whilst
multitasking. This changes the relationship of the body to sources of authority or information, and
specifically, the “pushiness” (the functionality of push notifications) of some devices creates new
relationships to technology and advice. These changes suggest the possibility of new forms of
subjectivity or enactments of pregnancy and mothering. Therefore apps and social media are not
simply sources of information, but also act as performative devices in that they prompt or provoke
women to act on and through their bodies via these devices. 3 These devices are designed to help
women (and their partners) to engage in their pregnancies and parenting in particular ways.
The assemblage of devices specific to pregnancy and motherhood provide a range of detailed
techniques to monitor, manage and assess the body and therefore play a role in the ongoing project of
motherhood. Women are encouraged to engage with a variety of maternal devices as a way of
generating and/or practicing technologies of the self, and smartphones and smartphone apps are one
specific genre of these devices. Other maternal devices include: dietary charts, exercise regimes,
calculators for pregnancy weight gain, charts for foetal movements, blood sugar level testing and
breastfeeding charts. These “maternal devices” prompt the user in particular ways, making
suggestions and connections and encouraging them to invest in, make sense of and act upon
particular principles. These devices produce a reflexive subject concerned with health and lifestyle
and are geared towards practices of active health, lifestyle, self-assessment and self-education.
Digital health technologies (including apps) are a form of mediating technology which shape
meaning and create new spaces for health and responsibilisation, and at the same time, reshape
individual’s understandings of norms and standards. Digital health technologies are largely
consistent with preceding modes of neoliberal governmentality, but their most significant feature is
that they extend these modes of responsibilisation into new spaces and practices and forms of
calculation. By critically analysing a number of smartphone apps and social media sites, this article
draws on and challenges Foucauldian theory on social relations and practices of the self. An
analysis of these technologies poses questions as to how pregnant women and new mothers become
particular ethical subjects, because as Brown and Webster [32] (p. 7) argue “technologies are
3

The term “devices” is adopted from Kane Race [30]. In his research on hydration practices, Race reappropriates
Michel Callon and colleagues’ [31] use of the concept “market devices” in order to consider how certain online
functions, including self-assessment tools, act as calculative devices. These devices are connected to technologies
of the self already implicated in biocitizenship.

65
always socio-technologies”. By assessing the kind of work these devices could encourage and the
multiplicity of ways women could potentially engage with them, one is able to consider a wider
range of the different approaches to embodying and negotiating the moral injunctions and forms of
advice women encounter in the transition to first-time motherhood.
5. Background and Methods
The interview data used in this article was collected as part of a qualitative study on the
changing nature of pregnancy and mothering practices in the context of new media, and how
technologies may be enabling new spaces for experiential learning and health responsibilisation.
This empirical research formed the basis of my PhD entitled “On a Tightrope? Technologies of
Motherhood in Neoliberal Society”. This project received ethics approval from both the University
of Sydney and the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (RPAH) in December, 2011 (Protocol No
X11-0334 & HREC/11/RPAH/526).4
The use of smartphones and apps emerged as a theme of interest late in this research project.
The constant mention of various apps by the participants prompted me to examine a number of key
pregnancy and parenting apps in terms of the discourses they mobilise and their functionality.
This examination is the focus of this article. I was also able to draw on the characterisations from
participants in attempting to understand the affordances of apps and the role they may play during
both pregnancy and new motherhood. These characterisations are central to my analysis and
interpretation of these technologies and devices. 5 Although the interview data collected on the
themes of digital health technologies and social media was not exhaustive, I argue that it is
important in providing a new methodological approach to research in this area. As the theme of this
special issue is the development of critical approaches to digital health technologies I argue that
this qualitative research offers a new approach. Rather than focusing on the devices or technologies
themselves, the focus is on how it is that people interact with these devices and create new
relationships, practices of gathering information and accessing information as a result of these
interactions. Therefore, rather than offering detailed insight into my specific participants’ use of
smartphones and apps, this article provides an analysis of several significant convergences in
software, technologies and practices of the self. The significance of this analysis is that it provides
a platform for further research (including more detailed empirical research) in this area.
In this article I analyse smartphone apps and social media sites using a discourse analysis
approach. Two theorists using a Foucauldian model of discourse who have strongly influenced my
approach to discourse analysis are Deborah Lupton [33,34] and Jane Sunderland [35]. Both of these
theorists have applied critical discourse analysis to extensive fields including public health and

The interviews occurred during January and September, 2012. Ten of the twelve participants were interviewed
twice: once during the third trimester of their pregnancy and again when their babies were 3–7 months of age. The
majority (20 of 22) of the interviews took place in the participant’s home, with the remaining two interviews
occurring in a neutral public location chosen by the participant. In both cases, this was a private room on campus at
the University of Sydney.
This development was particularly important in the context of my broader research aims which focused on
understanding the different ways women negotiate the transition to first-time motherhood.

parenting literature. Their applied use of Foucauldian theories have provided analytical approaches
focusing on interpreting the relationships between social knowledge, discourse, power and existing
institutional dominance.
It is important to analyse smartphone apps and use of social media sites as forms of discourse,
as “different ways of structuring knowledge and social practice”, or “seeing” the world [36] (p. 3).
But more than simply providing new ways of “seeing”, these devices also prompt and concretise
specific ways of acting, at the same time, shaping and organising the gendered discourses of
parenting and mothering in particular. For an increasing number of people, apps and social media
have been integrated into daily life which we can view as an extension, and digitalisation, of the
expert patient role, shaping the everyday management of illness and health and social processes
associated with them. Apps and social media, through their broad range of language and utility,
influence gendered identities and relations, suggesting a particular representation of mothering
(and fathering). This article will examine how certain apps reference, implicitly or explicitly,
ideologies related to pregnancy and mothering, such as “intensive” mothering and “helicopter”
mothering, and the expert patient ideal.
6. Pregnancy: Is There An App for That?
Many apps for pregnancy (and mothering) are temporally tailored, meaning that the app is
calibrating the pregnancy in terms of “stages” and “time” and encouraging the user to connect with
her pregnancy as an exercise in foetal development. Temporally tailored apps often also include a
notification function which sends regular (usually daily or weekly) updates to the user. Many
pregnancy-specific websites also send regular temporally tailored updates via email and these
emails function in a similar way. This adds a new level of awareness to pregnancy where the
updates are “pushed” to the user rather than the user seeking this information out. The updates can
include a variety of information but will usually include details on foetal development as well as
what the pregnant woman should expect that week. They can also include pieces of advice for the
mother such as foods to avoid and exercises to engage in, possibly invoking behavioural change as a
result. The Dr Miriam Stoppard Pregnancy [37] app includes weekly reminders for the user to watch
video content which includes Dr Stoppard giving them “personalised” advice for each week of their
pregnancy, and to record notes on their experiences and to update the “Bump Tracker”, a feature
which allows women to use their smartphone to create a gallery of images of their growing
“bump”. From this perspective, the pregnant woman is made to be constantly aware of her
pregnancy and from the first signs of pregnancy, to interactively engage with her body and her
foetus as an exercise in both health management and bonding.
Apps are marketed as convenient because they allow access to information anytime, anywhere,
but they are also imposing, pushing information to women at regular intervals that they may
otherwise avoid or fail to seek out of their own accord. In this sense, apps are not simply temporally
tailored but involved in the organisation of women’s temporality through the mechanism of the
push notification. Therefore these devices create a new form of awareness and responsibilisation:
“push responsibilisation”.

67
Many women access temporally tailored emails or apps for the supposed convenience of regular
updates. Therefore, not only is content important, but the accessibility and portability of these apps
can be viewed by users as essential for today’s busy lifestyles. These sentiments were echoed by the
women interviewed in my study. When asked about emails or apps they receive or use, their
descriptions focused not just on the content, but the portability, accessibility and integration into a
busy lifestyle:
Emily, 37 (prenatal interview): “I would kind of flick through, say something, he’d [her
husband] be interested, grab it, read it, put it down. But I think they’re the kind of, like
app things are good, ‘cause you can update them little things and try and talk about
them...little bits of information at the right time”.
As this quote indicates, apps also appeal to individuals in regards to the digestibility of
information they contain—rather than searching through an entire chapter or pamphlet or website,
apps provide tidbits of information for pregnant women, mothers, and partners. Apps and email
updates allow for what I characterise here as a convenient and accessible “tidbitisation” 6 of
information, as the following quotes indicate:
Simone, 32 (prenatal interview): “so every week I receive a follow-up of where the
baby is at in the womb and maybe what’s going on with the pregnancy...that was
really helpful, ‘cause just a few hints, like a small newsletter, not too long to read,
just enough”.
Emily, 37 (prenatal interview): “I mean, it’s [the regular app update] very brief, basic.
But no, no it’s been good. Lots of little tidbits along the way as opposed to you sit
down and read a chapter [laughs]. So, which is kind of good.”
Diana, 29 (prenatal interview): “I’ve had...weekly email updates and that sort of thing,
um, so little tidbits of information as I go, just about how the baby’s going and things that
I might want to aware of...they’re good because they’re just little bits of
information...they’re not too much, and there’s usually not enough to freak you out or be
confusing or anything”.
Smartphone apps and social media such as Facebook and Twitter offer mums, particularly new
mums, also offer a novel form of socialisation or communication whilst staying inside the home,
even whilst multitasking, as Jenny states in the following quote:
Jenny, 41 (postnatal interview): “And, actually something else that’s probably, possibly
revolutionised um breastfeeding and mothering is the I-phone...I can be here for a long
time sometimes [feeding the baby], which is why the I-phone can be useful, for emails
or looking at the Facebook or the Twitter”.
Other mums in my study also spoke of the convenience of their smartphone and many used
Facebook and emails on their phones regularly in order to check for events related to their mothers’
6

This word is taken from the interview participants’ use of the word tidbits (as used by Emily and Diana, above) and
other similar characterisations of information as small and accessible by other participants.

68
groups or to ask questions about their baby. So for new mums the smartphone offers an extension
of their social life and allows them to continue communicating with friends, even whilst being
housebound or involved in domestic tasks specifically related to mothering.
Therefore smartphones and apps are “revolutionising” the experience of pregnant women and new
mothers, as they claim to generate convenience, connectivity, flexibility, efficiency and the
tidbitisation of information. These apps are often sold as tools of convenience although this
“convenience” at times involves greater work and expectations than the alternative (discussed in
more detail later). In addition, women may view new technologies like apps as empowering in that
they offer women new feelings of control over their bodies and give them a particular knowledge of
their pregnancies and the behaviour of their baby/babies or children; although having more
knowledge could also equate to engaging in a greater deal of physical labour and “emotional work”
during pregnancy and motherhood [38]. Because the female body has traditionally been seen as
leaky, uncontrollable, open and permeable, new technologies appear to allow women to attempt to
reassert control via diet, exercise or the gathering of information.
7. Apps and Social Media
Facebook is a high-traffic social media platform which can be accessed on smartphones via the
Facebook app or the Facebook mobile site. There are many uses for Facebook, including social
connection, joining shared interest groups, virtual people watching and social surveillance [4].
Facebook therefore offers a variety of social networking options and potential for the maintenance
and formation of social capital for both pregnant women and new mums [39]. The social support
networks parents access have therefore expanded to include online communities such as social
networking sites. Declaring one’s pregnancy online could enable women to connect with other
expecting mums, bonding and sharing in experiences, leading some social work researchers to
argue the social value of social media. For example, Bartholomew et al. argue: “Facebook serves
an important function in the acquisition of social capital and social support resources, which are
beneficial at the transition to parenthood” [1] (p. 464). Facebook may also serve as a site through
which individuals seek to validate their identification as parents. In this sense, Facebook provides a
new form of comparison of social and cultural expectations surrounding pregnancy and motherhood.
The calculability of “likeability” on social media forums like Facebook has the potential to
transform online “performances” of mothering into specific forms of social competition.
Devices and social media such as Facebook also have the potential to transfer the pregnant
woman or mother’s virtual identity onto her baby. In this sense, the virtual identity of the baby
works to simultaneously deflect attention from the mother (as she hides behind the scenes like a
puppeteer) and projects the mother’s work (of being a good mother) and worth (measured through
her baby), rendering these visible. This presents a digital performance of what I call the
“puppeteering mother”. In wanting to project her baby, instead of herself, she also encapsulates
“being-for-intimate-others” where this projected version of self-centeredness or self-worth, of
presenting the baby as “my measure” reconfigures neoliberal self-centeredness to include the
projected “other”. By representing their baby though digital platforms mothers are able to accrue
self-worth that might otherwise be difficult to attain or is normally accrued through other social

69
forums. In particular, the “likeability” feature makes these digital projections so interesting because
self-worth is rendered calculable.
Facebook may be one of the social communities in which women and their partners first
announce their pregnancy7 and where they may share ultrasound images, their experiences during
pregnancy such as dietary and fitness dilemmas, as well as their excitement at the impending
arrival of their baby. In this way, babies (or foetuses) have an “online birth” prior to their physical
birth. This online presence may continue as the child’s birth is announced on Facebook, along with
other key milestones. As social media gains more importance in people’s everyday lives they are
increasingly likely to announce life events online, in the process altering the dynamics of
social relations.
Rose and Novas [29] (p. 440) describe new forms of citizenship in collectives organised around
specific medical conditions and/or knowledge as “informational bio-citizenship” and the new
electronically networked individuals who are linked to such communities as “digital bio-citizens”.
Deborah Lupton goes one step further in describing “the digitally engaged patient” [40] (p. 256) who
embodies digital health technologies to engage in self-care and self-monitoring. I argue that social
media creates a whole new set of relationships for the “digitally engaged” maternal subject which
involve the publicising of foetal and child development via a so-called “friendly” spectacle. This
publicising enables others—a public of virtual friends and acquaintances—to become directly
implicated in what was previously a very personal sphere of intimacy. This new spectacle is also
interactive and allows others to engage with the online foetus by commenting, liking or sharing
images or statements. This suggests a new way of quantifying or measuring social status.
Using the ultrasound image in such a way provides a social rather than medical way to view the
insides of women’s bodies as well as the foetus/baby. This new social ritual also reinforces foetal
individuality and personhood in a very visible and public way. This not only occurs via the
ultrasound image, but also via regular profile updates and comments. The foetus has developed its
own digital social identity and status before it is even born—some new parents even create
Facebook profiles for their new babies—and a digital footprint of pregnancy and mothering is
also created.
One software designer has taken advantage of this new trend by creating an app which allows the
user to do more than just post an ultrasound image. Pimp My Ultrasound allows users to “have fun”
with ultrasound images: “you can have several months of entertainment and create everlasting
memories” [41]. The app enables you to add text bubbles, headgear including tiaras, bows, baseball
cap or football helmets, accessories including a credit card, microphone, guitar or martini glass and
picture frames. In this way, the app allows the user to pick and choose certain items in order to give
the foetus a gender and/or personality.
The app is purported to provide harmless fun for parents-to-be but could also play a role in early
social shaping, particularly gender shaping as many of the accessories are gender stereotyped.
“Playing” with the ultrasound image is performative as it encourages a particular type of bonding
and attachment with the foetus. It makes the foetus “real”. It sexes the foetus. The foetus is no

The list of profile options on Facebook now even include “Expected: Child” and the unborn baby can also be given
a name in this profile.

70
longer an abstraction, but a baby with an imagined personality. “Babyhood” is created when the
image is “baby-ised” into a dancing, sleeping, sporty or thumb-sucking individual. Technology and
the human imagination combine to form the “cyborg foetus” [20,28]. In the following quote, Jenny
discusses how her baby’s personality develops in her imagination after the sexing ultrasound:
Jenny, 41 (prenatal interview): “finding out that she was a girl probably changes things
dramatically...because then she starts to take on a personality in your own mind...first
of all there’s those flutters and it’s just really exciting because it’s like more
reinforcement...that it’s there and happening. And then when your, your belly’s big
enough to start to see rippling and you start to give it, the baby, more of a type. Like
active or whatever”.
Ultrasound images function as a form of “mediated realism” and the foetus is imagined into
action—playing a guitar, giggling, thinking or resting. In addition, by “playing with” ultrasound
images through apps like Pimp My Ultrasound particular gendered expectations for the mother and
father, as well as gendered performances from the baby boy and/or baby girl are articulated [42].
This is part of the “fetishization” of the foetus, as Petchesky states: “Indeed, the very idea of
“bonding” based on a photographic image implies a fetish: the investment of erotic feelings in a
fantasy” [43] (p. 277). This fetishising of the foetus works to create both baby and mother. In a
press release for an Australian 3D/4D ultrasound company, it is also suggested that the bonding
experience of a 3D ultrasound helps to responsibilise women to care for themselves during
pregnancy: “He [owner, Ray Jordan] adds that studies have shown that after using 3D ultrasound
mothers took better care of themselves” [44]. It would not be unreasonable to suggest that apps like
Pimp My Ultrasound may also help to responsibilise women by encouraging them to bond with
their foetus, assign a gender, and create a “social identity” for them. Other apps also “baby-ise” via
real-life images of foetuses attached to detailed descriptions of current foetal development. These
apps are now part of the (bio)technological environment which constructs the contemporary foetal
identity and meanings surrounding it.
8. Sprout Pregnancy
Pregnancy Sprout Lite [45] is temporally tailored and encourages users to track their baby’s
progress. This app allows social media interaction where users can share progress on Facebook and
“Email notes and development information”. It is both strange and fascinating that Sprout enables
the user to upload 3D images of what her foetus would look like at various stages of her pregnancy,
complete with a personalised name (see Figure 1, below). Miriam Stoppard’s app [37] has a similar
feature which allows the user to view the foetus’ development throughout the pregnancy, but it
goes one step further by allowing the user to imagine what it is like to be the foetus in her womb.
The user can record sound clips and play them back with distortion to imitate the sound of her
voice to the baby in the womb. It also allows the user to take photographs which are distorted
according to how the baby would view the image through their developing eyes. In this way,
the foetus is not only personalised, but the mother is encouraged to embody the foetus from
a sensory perspective.

71
The user of the Sprout app can also share her baby’s kicks on Facebook and later, she can post
contraction information during her labour. These features “baby-ise” the foetus and the social
media connectivity gives the Sprout app a new layer of meaning by socialising the unborn baby and
its activities, allowing other Facebook users to characterise the unborn baby, “like” the images
and/or follow its progress before it is even born. This means that the app functions to extend the
pregnancy experience beyond the pregnant subject making the pregnancy a more social event, just
as 3D/4D ultrasounds and the Pimp My Ultrasound app do.
Figure 1. Screenshot from Sprout app which reveals a very humanised image of a
foetus who appears to be sleeping and sucking its thumb. Despite not being born yet,
the foetus has already been named Emma. Source: Med ART Studios (with permission
to use image).

The Sprout app also includes a “Doctor Visit Planner” which encourages the user to take up the
role of the expert patient with functions such as “Create a list of questions for your doctor” and
“Record your doctor’s answers” [45]. The “Doctor Says” section encourages healthy behaviour via
different recommendations which relate to diet, exercise, symptoms and concerns. Miriam
Stoppard’s app [37] also provides information on “Looking after your body and mind” and detailed
information on diet which is presented as primarily for the sake of the baby, rather than the mother.
This section of the app is entitled: “Eating for my baby” and presents healthiness as central to
“being-for-intimate-others”. By connecting the app’s functions to medical authority and expertise
meaningful connections are made between medicine and the organisation of the body. Ettorre [7]
(p. 246) developed the term “reproductive asceticism” to represent the ways in which pregnant
women are expected to manage, monitor and control their bodies for the sake of the foetus. I argue
that comprehensive pregnancy apps like this one represent a digitalised organisation of
reproductive asceticism.

72
Encouragement to perform the expert patient role and ideal, healthy citizen is also invoked via
Sprout’s Kick counter to record baby’s kicks, the Contraction timer to reliably record contractions,
and the weight tracker which ensures regular recording and tracking of weight gain during
pregnancy. Each of these features increase awareness of the pregnancy, make the app performative
and also allow the app to extend beyond the pregnant subject, to function as an extension of the
available spaces for health responsibilisation and recording of relevant data, playing a role in the
development of maternity as an exercise in data management.
9. Baby Connect
As I have argued, apps are a mechanism with which individuals can pursue the “will to health” [46]
as they offer possibilities of improving, reshaping, enhancing and optimising pregnancy and
motherhood. During my research I found that some women approach pregnancy and motherhood as a
project. If such is the case, this new range of tools and devices offers them new ways to
professionally and technically adapt to such a project. The significance of these technologies lies in
their extra level of functionality where they become tools which women engage with in order to enact
or embody the “good” mother, the “yummy mummy” [47] or ideologies of mothering such as
intensive mothering [17]. Devices such as smartphone apps offer mothers a new way to implement
different forms of parenting, expertise and self-discipline. smartphone apps provide a new form of
expertise which allows mothers to delegate mundane “administrative” tasks or to calculate specific
practices, then carry them out, and in some cases, track or record these practices. I argue these
changes are turning motherhood into an administrative and self-calculable activity.
Baby Connect [48] is an extremely comprehensive activity tracking app for mothers which
includes trending charts, graphical reports, medicine and vaccine timers and notifications, weekly
averages, file export capabilities and unlimited data allowances. This “data” can include information
on feeding, diapers, sleeping, breastmilk pumping, temperature, games played, mood, pictures and
even GPS locations (see Figure 2). This data can also be formatted and emailed as reports to spouses,
nannies or doctors, or it can be used to compare with previous daily or weekly averages in order to
identify trends. The app is accessible anywhere there is an internet connection, via the online account
which is able to synchronise data from multiple devices.
Baby Connect is marketed as both a tool of convenience and as a way for working mums to
feel connected and up-to-date with their children’s activities, health and development, allowing
“you to exchange information in real time with your spouse, babysitter, nanny or daycare wherever
they are” [48]. This can even include alerts when specific behaviours or data are recorded. As noted
above, the recording of data and reminder capabilities create another way for mothers who view
child raising as a “project” to engage in a professionalised entrepreneurial engagement with
motherhood where they can expertly keep track of their children according to data sets, and even if
they are delegating particular tasks to other carers, they remain in control of what is recorded, what
is concerning (alerts) and what particular activities the child engages in.

sleep and his mood: “Adrien is Happy”. Any of these features could be posted on
Facebook or sent to other synchronised devices. Source: Seacloud Software (with
permission to use image).

Writing about Baby Connect in The Atlantic, Mya Frazier claims that the app’s greatest
innovation: “has been in charting and analyzing children’s data, in the process making parenthood
a more quantifiable, science-based endeavour” [49] (p. 28). This is a fascinating throwback to G.
Stanley Hall’s concept of “scientific” mothering. As part of Hall’s Child Study movement, mothers
were encouraged to study their children, take notes on their behaviour, and compare observations
with other mothers thus serving as providers of data for the experts [50]. The introduction of
baby-tracking apps allows the resurfacing of “scientific” mothering where mothers are able to
gather data in order to better track and understand their child’s development, and even share this
with other mothers or medical staff.
The use of particular devices and techniques for collecting data, rather than relying on the
“subjective” accounts or competence of the mother, privileges “objective” scientifically
recorded data in the care or management of children in a time when biocitizenship is becoming
increasingly implicated with new medical technologies [51,52]. In line with discussions of
“cyborg-ificiation”—where the distinction between human and machine is increasingly blurred—I
argue that apps form a digital proxy for subjective medical accounts. This suggests subjective
accounts have been replaced by objective medical calculations via devices, producing a new form of
calculability. This instrumentalises the body in a particular way according to a particular set of
measurement devices and calculations.
In her article, Frazier interviews one mother who consistently uses Baby Connect, arguing that
the app allows parents “to debug your baby for problems” [49] (p. 28). Again this references the

74
metaphor of human as machine and the concept of the cyborg. As Brown and Webster argue, this
mother’s management of her son via his data set is part of today’s modern reflexive project:
Today, maintaining the body is a problem of technological apprehension or capture
requiring the production of new systems for codification, storage, accessibility and
distribution. The object of maintenance and care then is no longer simply the individual
body, but representations or traces of the body in globalized systems of information and
data management. [32] (pp. 80–81).
Just as Brown and Webster suggest, it is not enough to simply rely on your own (or your child’s)
digital data sets, it is useful to view these data sets in a specific context. Soon this will be possible
as forthcoming versions of the app will enable parents to compare with other children in more
detail, offering a new digitalised way of posing the question “Is my child normal”?
The dictates of the expert patient ideal suggest that patients must have expert knowledge of their
health and, for mothers, this includes knowledge of their child’s health and development status.
It would therefore not be surprising if mothers choose to use apps like Baby Connect as part of their
“performance” of both good mothering and the expert patient ideal. In particular, as noted above,
the connection of these apps to social media allows mothers to share a digital performance of their
mothering. Whether this performance could take on a competitive character remains a question for
further research.
Another conceivable use for such tracking apps is their integration into childcare centres as a
way of providing a digital version of a “day book” which many centres already provide for parents.
This could include information on what was eaten, if there were any illnesses, complaints or
concerns. The features of Baby Connect suggest it could support a variant of “helicopter
parenting”, which is defined as controlling and over-involved parenting [53,54]. In the case of
apps such as Baby Connect, the over-involvement in children’s activities could be viewed as an
“off-site” version of helicopter parenting, where the “hovering” is performed digitally.
Miller and Rose argue the mobilisation of discourse does not occur through manipulation or
domination, but by “forming connections between human passions, hopes, and anxieties, and very
specific features of goods” [55] (p. 144). As the above discussion indicates, these hopes and
aspirations influence concerns over childhood health and development leading to the creation of apps
like Baby Connect. In addition, a new category of toys, games and software has recently emerged
which focuses on infant development, targeting aspiring middle-class parents. The discourse of
“infant brain science” has meant that gendered toys are often rejected in favour of “educational toys”
fostering imagination, creativity, social skills and education [56]. Infant brain science focuses on the
critical learning period of infant to three years of age [57]. Apps like Baby Connect can act to
reassure parents that their children are being adequately stimulated whilst in the care of others. In
addition, there are apps that focus specifically on intellectual stimulation for infants, drawing on the
discourse of Infant Brain Science, such as Baby Guide First Year [58] and the Baby Brain
Development Guide [59] which are both temporally tailored towards a normative framework of
developmental cues and expectations. These apps could ease parental anxiety over their inability to
supply constant intellectual stimulation as they provide games, visual items and tasks, but their

75
temporally tailored format could in turn raise concerns over speed of development if a child were to
fall behind the “normal” timeframes. These apps and the discourse of “infant brain science”
encourage a specifically classed version of “professionalised mothering” aimed at increasing
childhood intelligence and accomplishment according to neuroscientific principles [39].
10. Ebluebook
The Australian state of New South Wales’s (NSW) Ministry of Health have digitalised the “Blue
Book” which is a folder of information that mothers are given during pregnancy in order to record
information about their prenatal visits, the health of the baby in utero and the development and
health of the baby postnatally. This ebluebook app is personalised and temporally tailored and
includes a version of Save the Date (another NSW Ministry of Health app) with reminders for
immunisations, health checks, growth charts and information on development.
The app claims to give parents easy and convenient access to their child’s health records no
matter where they are. The deployment of discourses of convenience and mobility produces new
expectations that parents regularly update the book and, as “mobile” subjects, always be able to
monitor and access their child’s health history. Because child health is “put back in the hands of the
consumer” [60] (pp. 5–6) convenience and mobility are tied to empowerment, but also to
responsibility. The app serves to responsibilise parents for their children’s health monitoring and
developmental requirements and if parents do choose to share the ebluebook data with their health
care provider it allows that provider to discipline parents who have missed developmental health
checks such as immunisations. Therefore this device can work as a tool for surveillance and
discipline as well as convenience.
The ebluebook app also encourages parents as consumer-citizens to develop specific scientific
and medical understandings of their children’s growth and development, what Rose and Novas [29]
would term “informational citizenship”. This biomedical literacy encourages particular behaviours
and monitoring such as the regular measuring of height and weight in order to compare to norms or
averages, and promotes alignment with government regulations for immunisations. These outcomes
align in order to emphasise the dual role of the mother as both a good citizen and an expert proxy
patient for her child/children.
Brown and Webster argue that electronic patient records maintain the body “both as an
individual physical entity and as an abstract informational artefact” [32] (p. 81). Therefore the
ebluebook could be seen as a new mobilisation of the body, another digital artifact just like the
digitalised identity of the foetus and child on social media [52]. The implication of a digital identity
means we now also measure ourselves (and our intimate others) according to digitalised health data
and our social media presence, which also creates a measurable version of our “likeability”.
11. Pregnancy Apps for Men?
There are far fewer apps related to pregnancy (and parenting) for men than for women and it is
important to note that these apps are marketed in a very similar way to pregnancy books for men,
focusing on humour and tidbitisation of information [61,62]. They also tend to be significantly

76
gender stereotyped and somewhat patronising. For example, mPregnancy—for men with pregnant
women includes:
great illustrations of how the baby develops and describes the size in terms that men
understand e.g., similar to the size of a football, or a bottle of beer [63].
The app appeals to traditionally masculine-gendered activities such as providing information on
how to prepare a nursery, and dealing with finances and insurance. There are no pregnancy apps on
the market (that I have found) that provide this kind of information for women, even though many
women would undertake these tasks regardless of whether or not they have a male partner and
could find the inclusion of such information quite useful.
The app Pregnant Dad shares some features with mPregnancy including being marketed
humorously as an app for “surviving pregnancy as a father-to-be” [64]. New Dad—Pregnancy for
Dads app also appeals in this way with: “insightful and humorous descriptions” [65]. Just like
many pregnancy texts for men, pregnancy apps deploy humour in an attempt to tone down the
serious nature of the information, whilst also simplifying it; men are seen as the “bumbling
assistants” [62]. In contrast, guidebooks and apps for women are often directly marketed as serious
expert guides for the responsibilised expectant woman, albeit with the odd exception [66]. The
Pregnant Dad app again specifies the digestibility of information: “Sliced in 2–3 bits per week it
has the right amount of information for us men to follow” [64] and another, New Dad emphasises
this tidbitisation of information: “Surprise your wife with tidbits of information about the
development of your baby” [65].
The New Dad app also focuses on the woman’s experience, emphasising the importance of
keeping her “comfortable and happy” and even includes a “‘keep your wife happy’ widget” [65].
These kinds of inclusions remind us of the traditional man/woman split of rationality versus
emotionality. Men, who are more rational, need to be given information on how to keep their emotional
wives happy! The features of these apps for men suggest a particular role for men during pregnancy,
one which is “backgrounded”, as Sunderland argues in relation to parenting magazines [62,67]. A
male partner’s role in pregnancy and parenting is still discussed, or in the case of apps “designed”,
in a somewhat condescending or patronising manner. Men are constructed as being barely capable
of their “supporting role” and need all the help they can muster, including humorous, simplified
tidbits of information, and reminders about what being a good partner (and good dad) involves.
Together, these features render fathering an issue of “keeping up appearances” for the female
partner, rather than any serious attempt at engaging in the careful work of parenting. This is merely
“surface” work which suggests what men are supposed to be doing (impressing mum) and prompts
them, with the aid of a push notification, to do exactly that!
These features are reminiscent of the nature of many support resources for men with pregnant
partners, suggesting that although parenting and fathering appear to be “changing” in terms of
policy and sociocultural practices and expectations (including more involved dads and more dads
as primary carers), the mechanisms and devices to support these changes, such as apps, are lagging
behind. In their book “Constructing Fatherhood”, Lupton & Barclay argue that whilst women are

77
encouraged to seek advice and information on pregnancy and mothering, these continue to be seen
as essential components of femininity:
not as split from womanhood as fatherhood may sometimes be split from manhood.
Men and women, therefore, are negotiating parenting arrangements in a context in
which it is still considered that the mother is more important to her child’s welfare than
the father and “instinctively” possesses a greater capacity for nurturance [61] (p. 147).
This perspective is noticeable in the ways in which these apps for men target specific
masculinised behaviours (such as preparing a nursery and dealing with finances) separately from
parenting behaviours, and also play on the belief that men have no innate knowledge or intuition
when it comes to being a parent and nurturing a child. As this article has demonstrated, apps
marketed for maternal subjects are designed instead, to target responsibilisation or what I call
“being-for-intimate-others”.
12. Conclusions
A range of research has considered the collection of resources drawn upon during the transition to
motherhood, which include self-help books, magazines, friends and relatives and the internet.
Smartphones and apps, along with other forms of digital health technology, must now be
incorporated with these other resources and are deserving of further research. As this article suggests,
smartphone apps and social media sites may represent a particular way for women to engage with the
neoliberal project of responsibilisation. The health-conscious pregnant or maternal subject is now
likely to view apps and social media sites as a means to improve and monitor their pregnancies,
health and their children’s development and health. From this perspective, apps in particular are
claimed to be empowering technologies which enable women to take control of their experiences
and whilst doing so, this enables them to more efficiently enact the expert patient role. This in turn
works as a display of competence as a good mother, or mother-to-be. These apps also work to
represent the unborn as already a baby (or child) which has implications for pregnant women.
These women are not simply acting for the self but also for the unborn “other”, referred herein as
“being-for-intimate-others”.
I argue that devices such as apps and social media platforms that discuss pregnancy and
parenting may be appealing because, when mothering is so intensive (as Hays [17] suggests), these
technologies allow for the possibility of delegating responsibility for certain calculations, reminders
and tasks. This supposedly makes mothering easier because there is no need to remind oneself if it
is possible to rely on the push notification or “push responsibilisation” as I have characterised it.
But this pushiness is not necessarily always convenient and rather than being a pleasant reminder,
could develop into a rude intrusion. Nevertheless these devices are becoming more common and
certainly offer us a way to conceptualise different ways of pulling back from intensive mothering in
order to be a more “relaxed” mother. Some apps and social media platforms also allow women to
share experiences with each other which can be supportive and comforting.
Apps are representative of something uniquely distinctive about the way we order, engage with
and reshape our bodies and biology today. They are reflective of a wider set of cultural and social

78
changes in the understanding of our identity, our “lifestyle” and our body. Apps format motherhood
and pregnancy in a new way, instituting new rules into new devices and offering templates which
actively shape meanings and practices. Apps also represent a “tidbitisation” of information which is
delivered directly into the user’s intimate sphere, no matter where they are. This “device-ification”
of mothering purports to turn it into an administrative and calculable activity, valuing data over
subjective experiences and changing the meaning of what it is to mother and be a mother. Apps and
social media platforms that facilitate the portrayal of the unborn and the sharing of pregnancy and
parenting experiences are also representative of the contemporary intersection between social
media, medical advice, expectations of self-management and notions of convenience. They create
new social relations and valuing practices, such as “likeability” on Facebook, which have the
potential to alter our understandings of health and identity.
Future research should consider the multiplicity of women’s engagement with these apps across
the transition to first-time motherhood and for parents attempting to manage child health. It would
also be useful to conduct more research on the possible inconvenience of apps. Clearly the
“pushiness” of push responsibilisation would not always be convenient and could develop as an
intrusion into people’s daily routines. It would be productive to direct focus onto the lived
experiences associated with apps rather than lauding or criticising the content of apps. Further
questions to consider in an empirical study include: Who adopts these apps and why? Who rejects
these apps and why? Are push notifications ignored, considered obtrusive or do they prompt specific
practices or actions? How are apps and social media sites used by pregnant women and first-time
parents? How do apps and social media sites maintain, reproduce or challenge pre-existing gender
inequalities in parenting?

Detecting the Visible: The Discursive Construction of Health
Threats in a Syndromic Surveillance System Design
Baki Cakici and Pedro Sanches
Abstract: Information and communication technologies are not value-neutral tools that reﬂect
reality; they privilege some forms of action, and they limit others. We analyze reports describing
the design, development, testing and evaluation of a European Commission co-funded syndromic
surveillance project called SIDARTHa (System for Information on Detection and Analysis of Risks
and Threats to Health). We show that the reports construct the concept of a health threat as a sudden,
unexpected event with the potential to cause severe harm and one that requires a public health
response aided by surveillance. Based on our analysis, we state that when creating surveillance
technologies, design choices have consequences for what can be seen and for what remains
invisible. Finally, we argue that syndromic surveillance discourse privileges expertise in developing,
maintaining and using software within public health practice, and it prioritizes standardized and
transportable knowledge over local and context-dependent knowledge. We conclude that syndromic
surveillance contributes to a shift in broader public health practice, with consequences for fairness if
design choices and prioritizations remain invisible and unchallenged.

1. Introduction
The term syndromic surveillance describes a collection of methods within the ﬁeld of public
health surveillance. These are characterized by their use of secondary sources, referring to data
collected for a variety of purposes only indirectly related to population health. For example,
over-the-counter medicine sales, or records of ambulance dispatches from a hospital, or records of
emergency room visits can be considered secondary sources, because these data are not collected
with the primary intent to perform public health surveillance. Using this formulation, syndromic
surveillance is often positioned as an efﬁcient use of already collected data [1].
International public health institutions rely increasingly on automated and globalized surveillance, and this shift follows a rationale of vigilance and preparedness where “marginal and
dangerous” [2] events are given priority over broader determinants of health [3]. Within the discourse
of syndromic surveillance, numerical representations of populations and the application of statistical
analyses are essential to the task of constructing meaning from diverse sources of surveillance data.
The use of these types of surveillance methods follows a long tradition of health discourses where
individuals and populations are constructed as knowable and governable by establishing comparative
systems to analyze their similarities and differences [4] (p. 190).

84
Equally important is the idea of disease as a collection of symptoms and signs observed by a
medical gaze [5] (pp. 88–106). The idea of extending the medical gaze and the multiplication of
ways of representing individuals and populations are not exclusive to public health institutions. Two
other analyses included in this special issue also deal with systems of classiﬁcation and comparison,
which make use of similar discourses. In the two studies, these systems have consequences for how
motherhood is performed [6] and how people reﬂect about themselves [7].
We analyze reports describing the design, development, testing and evaluation of a European
Commission co-funded syndromic surveillance project called SIDARTHa (System for Information
on Detection and Analysis of Risks and Threats to Health). We start with the assumption that
information and communication technologies (ICTs) are never value-neutral. They necessarily reﬂect
the viewpoints of their designers, the inﬂuence of others involved in their construction and the
consequences of the material limitations encountered during their development [8–10]. With our
analysis, we aim to identify how a syndromic surveillance discourse privileges or excludes speciﬁc
types of knowledge and practices. We show that the discourse of syndromic surveillance constructs
the health threat concept as a sudden, unexpected event with the potential to cause severe harm
and one that requires a public health response aided by surveillance. Based on our analysis, we
state that when creating surveillance technologies, design choices have consequences for what can
be seen and for what remains invisible. Finally, we argue that syndromic surveillance discourse
privileges expertise in developing, maintaining and using software within public health practice, and
it prioritizes standardized and transportable knowledge over local and context-dependent knowledge.
We conclude that syndromic surveillance contributes to a shift in broader public health practice, with
consequences for fairness if design choices and prioritizations remain invisible and unchallenged.
2. Background
The earlier applications of syndromic surveillance were characterized by the use of health-related
data that preceded diagnosis and the continual monitoring of disease indicators to detect outbreaks
of communicable diseases earlier than traditional methods [11–13]. More recently, the deﬁnition of
syndromic surveillance has broadened to include the monitoring of non-communicable diseases and
other health conditions, such as heat-related illnesses, injuries caused by tornadoes or respiratory
illness after wildﬁres [14].
A well-known example of syndromic surveillance is Google Flu Trends [15,16], which uses
search queries entered by users into Google as indicators of inﬂuenza outbreaks. The developers
of the system have claimed that they can “accurately estimate the current level of weekly inﬂuenza
activity in each region of the United States” [15] (p. 1012), although the estimates have not always
been accurate [17,18]. While the system itself is well-known, it is highly unusual, as it is run by a
private company. The majority of syndromic surveillance systems are used by public institutions,
such as regional and national health authorities.
Many different types of ICTs are used for communicable disease surveillance. Bravata et al. [19]
provide a broad review of 115 systems and identify those that provide syndromic signals. Other
reviews focus on syndromic surveillance and include more recent systems [20,21]. Additionally,

85
the Triple-S project provides an extensive list of syndromic surveillance systems used within
Europe [22].
2.1. Challenges
The impact of syndromic surveillance on the already limited resources available for public health,
for example the costs of dealing with potentially large numbers of false positives generated by these
systems, has been discussed by public health practitioners and scholars. One of the earliest challenges
was by Reingold [23] who asked: “If syndromic surveillance is the answer, what is the question?”
Reingold points to the scarce resources within the ﬁeld of public health and challenges those who call
for the further development of syndromic surveillance to detail not how detection could be improved,
but if public health response would be improved in any way if these systems are implemented. He
emphasizes the importance of building capacity within the public health departments instead of
collecting and analyzing data externally, an activity often performed by for-proﬁt corporations in
departments without academic partners. In a discussion on the difﬁculties of creating a nation-wide
syndromic surveillance, Mostashari voices concerns about the relationship between detection and
response capacity:
We have 80 percent of the nation covered but we really have nothing covered, because
signals come and go, and an e-mail maybe is sent out, and there’s no local capacity . . . If
you’re doing analysis for a thousand different towns, villages, cities, whatever, every day
you’re going to ﬁnd alarms. ([24]; cited in [25])
Similarly, Heffernan et al. [26] state that although their syndromic surveillance systems have been
beneﬁcial in detection, they are “essentially ‘smoke detectors’ and call for prompt investigation and
response if they are to provide early warning of outbreaks” [26]. They continue to recommend that
efforts for bioterrorism preparation should focus on hiring well-trained public health professionals
with responsibilities that are broader than just bioterrorism.
Fearnley [25] analyzes the debates surrounding the development and use of several nation-wide
syndromic surveillance systems in the U.S. and identiﬁes a central conﬂict: the early syndromic
surveillance systems were designed primarily for national bioterrorism preparedness, but the data
collection and reporting were assigned to public health institutions tasked with maximizing the health
of human populations. These systems collected data from many different, non-traditional sources
and transferred them to health departments. However, the collected data were not immediately
helpful, because “[m]ore information means more interpretive work, without certain beneﬁts; and
more detected events requires more epidemiological responses, without (at this point) the necessary
epidemiological resources to undertake them” [27] (p. 84). Fearnley points out that without
the resources to interpret the incoming data, the newly developed systems were not helpful to
epidemiologists.
In syndromic surveillance systems, collecting data is the key to tackling public health problems.
All syndromic surveillance systems are constructed with the assumption that gathering more data

86
helps public health authorities make decisions. Analyzing the practices that accompany ICT-based
surveillance systems in public health, French [28] identiﬁes the assumption that more data are helpful
as a consequence of an immaterial conception of information:
[. . . A]n immaterial conception of information, whether implicit or explicit, assumes that
information signiﬁes in the same way regardless of time or place. As a consequence
of this assumption the signiﬁcance of information-processing practices is minimized;
the material diversity of such practices, and the effort required to unify them, is
underestimated. French [28] (p. 111).
As French argues, data collection also comes at a cost. It requires signiﬁcant amounts of work to
standardize data, to connect systems and to ensure that data are transferred correctly from one place
to another. Ignoring the cost of collection or, more broadly, the material dimensions of information,
causes problems for ICTs. The very immediate consequence is that it requires more work. This is
the work of maintaining and interpreting.
In their extensive study of classiﬁcation, Bowker and Star point out that data entry is never a trivial
task: it requires trained staff to perform; it is prone to mistakes with respect to the classiﬁcations
being used, and there are always cultural variations in what is interpreted as worthy of recording and
what is omitted [29] (p. 107). Additionally, they state that there is always a tension between the
standardization of lists centrally, and their use locally [29] (p. 139). Finally, they emphasize that “all
category systems are moral and political entities” [29] (p. 324). As syndromic surveillance systems
rely heavily on rigid classiﬁcation schemes, they exhibit these characteristics.
Based on a study of medical records, Berg and Bowker also argue that data collection and recording methods inﬂuence how work is organized and which practices are considered to be part of that
work [30] (p. 532). Similarly, emphasizing data collection and information generation in public
health surveillance modiﬁes the deﬁnition of activities that belong to public health, and some
types of expertise are prioritized over others. For example, when syndromic surveillance is used,
familiarity with developing and maintaining software becomes an important requirement for public
health practice.
The concept of immutable mobiles, introduced by Latour [31] (p. 227), provides a way to engage
the processes of informatization and standardization in syndromic surveillance. Latour uses the
term to refer to objects that are archivable and comparable regardless of their age, place of origin
and context of use. For example, an entry in a table listing the admissions to the emergency room
can be considered an immutable mobile, because, unlike the locally bound emergency room, it can
be transported easily, compared to other descriptions, or even be organized in charts and statistics
to construct an aggregated view of events that occur in emergency rooms. The complexity of the
emergency room, or any other phenomenon, is overcome by translating it into intelligible and stable
objects. The power of these objects is tied to their simplicity, which makes complex phenomena
observable and manageable from a bird’s-eye view. For this reason, immutable mobiles allow
power—the power to see and the power to manage—to be exerted, irrespective of time and place.
However, the work of keeping these objects stable is often unaccounted for. In fact, the structures
that maintain them, such as the layout of the rows and columns in a table or the procedure for ﬁlling

87
out the details of each entry, like the objects, must also remain constant across places and contexts
for them to remain immutable. The concept of immutable mobile is descriptive, allowing us to
identify and describe certain objects in our analysis. We focus on how they are created and how
they are maintained. We then take a step further by problematizing the aspects of their creation and
maintenance. The immutability of these objects can only be accomplished by mobilizing people and
material resources around them and by keeping these networks together through constant work [31].
For example, the output of the peripheral surveillance systems are brought closer to each other by
categorizing syndromes, collecting data and creating graphs, but constant work is required to uphold
the categorizations. Given the costs and risks of immaterial conceptions of information [28] and the
work of standardization, we ask the question of who beneﬁts or what there is to be gained.
3. Analysis
SIDARTHa is designed to be installed at health institutions to monitor sources of emergency data,
including records of emergency dispatches and reports from emergency practitioners. We chose to
analyze the SIDARTHa project, as it is one of the largest syndromic surveillance systems developed
in Europe, and it involves multiple partners from different member states. Similar projects that focus
on single health institutions separately instead of one centralized system have also been developed in
the U.S., such as RODS (Real-Time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance) [32]. Although the majority
of syndromic surveillance systems in the last decade have been developed and used in the U.S., we
consider ourselves more qualiﬁed to analyze a European project due to our previous experience in
public health surveillance in an EU member state [33].
Our analysis is based primarily on the seven project reports published by the SIDARTHa project
between the years 2009 and 2010. They describe the process of design, development, testing and
evaluation of the SIDARTHa syndromic surveillance system. These reports form a suitable corpus
for discourse analysis, because the authors describe different stages of the project in detail, and they
state their reasons for their decisions. The earliest reports focus on literature reviews and pre-studies;
later reports describe the design and development of the system, and the most recent ones discuss
testing and evaluation. This progression allows us to observe changes and shifts in the project and
see how different ideas evolve throughout the design and development of the system.
We began our analysis by reading the seven project reports and marking all sentences that make
knowledge or truth claims related to the overall argument, that state a hypotheses or that present
research questions. We continued by marking sentences that inform the reader about the existence
of entities outside of the text. In this category, we included any statements that refer to uncertainty,
because such statements also provide insight into what is considered to exist only partially outside
the text. We also marked all sentences that refer to individuals or groups of people, because these
statements show how the text constitutes subject positions that are relevant to its own argument.
After this process was completed, we read only the marked sentences for each report and tried to
group them according to common themes based on either the topics they discuss or the frequency
of the words they use. We examined these themes in relation to knowledge [34] (p. 14), truth [35]
(pp. 92–96), [36] (p. 12) and subject positions [36] (p. 15). We repeatedly asked the question “what

88
is considered true in this statement?” and wrote down our interpretations, while keeping in mind
the identiﬁed themes for each report, the collection of marked sentences, as well as the unmarked
sentences referenced by the marked ones.
3.1. What is a Health Threat?
In the SIDARTHa reports, the aim of the project is stated as detecting public health
threats [37] (p. 1). The reports further describe their goal as helping public health authorities
to become aware of health threats earlier or even to prevent them. The scope of the term health
threat within the project reports is very broad: it refers to diseases, both communicable and
non-communicable [37] (p. 1), but it also refers to other events, such as ﬂoods, heat waves and even
volcanic eruptions [38]. Additionally, it can refer to acts of bioterrorism, which most commonly refer
to the intentional release of biological agents, such as anthrax, into the air in large quantities with the
intent to harm others [37] (p. 7).
From the perspective of syndromic surveillance systems, health threats ﬁrst become visible when
other surveillance systems capture their traces. For example, a person experiencing high fever and a
sore throat may visit the emergency room, where her visit is recorded in the admission logs, or several
people living in the same district might post on social media platforms about suffering from shortness
of breath and digestive problems. In both cases, the experiences of these individuals are recorded,
and those records are then accessed by syndromic surveillance systems. For these systems, the health
threat is best deﬁned in terms of data and signals: “Early detection of public health threats in general
relies on the components: timely and reliable data; the sensitivity, speciﬁcity; and timeliness of
signals detected.” [39] (p. 3).
Syndromic surveillance relies on the presence and the functioning of other surveillance systems.
For example, the primary motivation for tracking ambulance dispatches is not to generate signals
for syndromic surveillance. Ambulances are dispatched to retrieve patients, and the signals are
used for a variety of purposes. Ambulance drivers may need to track their working hours, or
hospital administrators may need to know how many ambulances are available to respond in case of
emergencies, etc. Every departure and arrival of the ambulance is logged for a multitude of reasons,
and syndromic surveillance systems depend on these logs, but the logs themselves are not produced
speciﬁcally, or at least not primarily, to support the practice of syndromic surveillance.
The SIDARTHa reports describe a system that can be used to collect emergency data in different
health institutions in multiple European countries independent of one another, each with their
own rules and regulations for gathering data. To form a more homogeneous set of records, the
designers propose a coding standard to convert the local data to the SIDARTHa-compatible version.
Organizationally, the data remains locally stored, as one of the aims of the system is to ensure that
the collected data does not leave the collecting institution or regional authority.
The standardized data format is a string of numbers with different ﬁelds. The designers state that
“[t]he minimum data set for syndromic surveillance must contain enough information to produce
the number of cases per day for temporal syndromic surveillance” [40] (p. 6). It includes seven
variables: the anonymous case identifying number, date, geographic reference, syndrome, age,

89
gender and severity. The ﬁnal three variables are called modiﬁers, because these are not essential
to constructing the number of cases, but the information contained within them may be relevant
for certain syndromes, such as gastroenteritis (or stomach ﬂu) in children or heat-related illness
in the elderly. These particular variables are chosen based on a survey of availability within the
countries that participate in the SIDARTHa project, and it is the minimal set of properties that all of
the participants are able to provide.
Using the standard, it is possible to represent each ﬁeld using numbers, even when receiving data
from different sources. For example, the case identiﬁcation can be ﬁlled using the call identiﬁcation
code if the data are provided by an emergency medical dispatch center, or it can be ﬁlled using the
patient identiﬁcation code if the provider is an emergency department. The date is converted to a
series of unambiguous numbers by specifying the order that day, month and year appear in the string.
Geographic reference is more heterogeneous; the numbers contained in this ﬁeld can refer to X and
Y coordinates generated using the Global Positioning System (GPS), health zone codes, post codes
or community codes. Attempting to ﬁt gender into this form brings the ubiquitous problem of coding
gender as a binary and the transition from sex to gender in the system vocabulary. The original
speciﬁcation of the standard provides “0” for male and “1” for female, and the ﬁnal implementation
of the system changes the order and adds a third category, “unknown” [41] (p. 33).
All of the variables we have described above pertain to the identiﬁcation of persons and their
locations. The actual work of describing syndromes occurs in the remaining two variables: syndrome
and severity. The syndrome category requires the largest amount of work to convert into a number.
Syndromes are divided into six categories: inﬂuenza-like, gastrointestinal, respiratory, intoxication,
environment-related (heat-related) and unspeciﬁc. Since the system is designed to be compatible with
many different sites, a multitude of conversion tables are provided to make possible the homogeneous
coding of cases for any SIDARTHa system. The coding manual provides a series of tables to allow
this conversion, where the codes of other, more established standards, such as the International
Classiﬁcation of Diseases (ICD), can be converted to the SIDARTHa standard [40].
At the end of this conversion, the health threat is narrowed from a wide variety of uncontrollable
events to a series of numbers that can be transmitted without change and one that refers to the same
thing regardless of context. Unlike the data collected in each institution, which carry marks of local
practices particular to each case, the resulting string is constructed to function independently of its
context. It is easily comparable and combinable across different databases. In Latour’s terms, this
standardization creates an immutable mobile [31] that can be used for statistical analysis in any
institution. Freed from their earlier contexts, these strings of numbers gain a comparability that
the contextually-rich data available at the institutions do not possess. Once they are created by the
SIDARTHa software, their comparability is put to use through the work of different classiﬁcation
and detection algorithms.
The classiﬁcation may indicate change over time, or it may include a spatial component that
connects the data points to particular places using GPS coordinates or postal codes. Although the
algorithms vary depending on the input and the intent, the primary purpose of this analysis is to divide
the data points into two groups: expected and unexpected. The data points that end up in the expected

90
category are not of high importance to the system designers. These may indicate low-risk diseases
in low volumes or a seasonal variation in an illness (implying that the change occurs every year).
The designers of SIDARTHa are much more interested in the unexpected category. This category
includes all of the data points that have been marked by the system as deviating from the norm.
These unexpected events are all potential health threats within the system.
The designers state that one of SIDARTHa’s strengths is its ﬂexibility: “[T]he SIDARTHa
system can easily be adjusted to cover additional health threats, in this case the volcanic ash cloud
with new syndromes such as trafﬁc accidents and cardiovascular syndrome.” [42] (p. 10). This
ﬂexibility is not only due to the way the system has been constructed, but also because of how the
discourse of syndromic surveillance describes health threats. In another report, they point out that
“[o]ne important feature of syndromic surveillance is ﬂexibility, which allows the generation and
monitoring of syndromes according to suddenly emerging, potential health threats” [39] (p. 3). In
this deﬁnition, a health threat is a sudden event that has the potential to affect population health.
The words “suddenly” and “potential” highlight the issue of the absent subject in the deﬁnition: for
whom is the event sudden or unexpected, and what is meant by the potential to affect? The concern
about sudden events can be viewed from the perspective of public health authorities who would be
expected to respond to an event. Suddenness can then be stated relative to how long it would take
for the authorities to act (by contacting the patients, by visiting the clinics, by issuing public notices,
etc.) when the health threat appears. Deﬁning the limits of the word “potential” are much more
difﬁcult. For example, an inﬂuenza outbreak can sometimes spread rapidly in a population, but result
in only minor suffering as the infected experience the discomfort of a sore throat. However, it can
also cause major illness in those who are infected and even become life-threatening for those who
already suffer from other conditions. Complicating the decision even further, the difference between
the two is often not clear until its effects are experienced by individuals. The public health response
is required to negotiate this conﬂict and to come to a decision about the limits of the potential of a
disease to affect the population.
In the SIDARTHa reports, a particularly unusual event serves to illustrate the potential usefulness
of the system for public health response, even in cases of non-detection. Following the eruption of the
Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland in 2010, the project consortium developed a method to evaluate
the potential public health impact of the ensuing ash cloud. The event is described as offering a
suitable scenario for testing the system, although the authors also point out:
This report uses the term ‘volcanic ash cloud’ without determining if the ash cloud was
a cloud or rather a contamination. Therefore, it should be understood that the term ‘ash
cloud’ used throughout this report is not to be understood as a scientiﬁc term. It should
be further noted that the authors do not intend to give any prejudice on the question
if there was any risk to health at all caused by the ash cloud as such. The intention
of this rapid assessment was to test the capability of the SIDARTHa concept and pilot
syndromic surveillance system to be timely adjusted for monitoring a suddenly occurring
event potentially affecting health [emphasis in the original] [38] (p. 3).

91
A sudden event and its potential to affect health both appear in this justiﬁcation for performing the
ash cloud assessment using the SIDARTHa system. Establishing an event as a health threat occurs
before the investigation begins, but the results of the investigation do not fully resolve the status of the
event either. In the four SIDARTHa implementation sites in Austria, Denmark, Germany and Spain,
the system identiﬁes no signiﬁcant correlation between the volcanic ash cloud and the unusual signals
of respiratory conditions reported during the same period. The authors state that “further in-depth
analysis of case characteristics is necessary” [38] (p. 16), but also mention that their investigation,
and the fact that it was possible to perform it at all, demonstrates the “ﬂexibility of syndromic
surveillance systems to be used for ad-hoc surveillance after suddenly occurring events” [38] (p. 16).
In the booklet Generic Public Health Preparedness in Europe, a brief description of the SIDARTHa
project is accompanied by several quotes from Dr Thomas Krafft, the scientiﬁc-technical coordinator
of the project. Commenting on the volcano investigation, he states:
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control asked us to test out SIDARTHa
during this time to see if there were any health impacts from the volcanic ash plume . . . .
We found no increased demand for emergency care services. It is important to be able to
distinguish between ‘real threats’ and ‘perceived threats’ [43].
This division between real and perceived threats positions SIDARTHa, and by extension, syndromic
surveillance, as the arbiter of truth for public health practice in the implementation sites. The
operations of SIDARTHa are also perceptions, although they are perceptions of expertise, supported
by advanced ICTs and public health authorities. The “real” in the quote can be interpreted as
describing events that public health authorities should act upon to improve the health of a population;
the “perceived” can also be interpreted as events that they should act upon to reassure the population
that there is no health effect. In either case, the detection possibilities offered by SIDARTHa are
geared towards shaping the type of public health response following an event.
In the beginning, the traces of different individuals are collected in various public health
surveillance systems and converted into the SIDARTHa standard to create a more uniform unit
that is compatible with the different methods of statistical analysis. Up until this point, the
traces of individuals shed their context until only the bare minimum remained. The contents
of that bare minimum are deﬁned by the SIDARTHa standard. After reaching that point, the
work of inscribing a new context into the numbers begins. The ﬁrst step is the statistical
analysis, which constructs the objects that public health institutions can act on, followed by the
visualization of the results, which show the traces in the unexpected category. The process that
begins with the set of recorded traces and eventually becomes the evidence for the existence
or the non-existence of the health threat depends on a long chain of translations between
different systems and different mediums. When the authors assert their claim as “[e]mergency
care demand shows a pattern allowing for detection of unusual aberrations from the expected
demand” [44] (p. 20), they refer to the large web of surveillance systems that individually construct
and link the patterns, detections, aberrations and expectations.

92
3.2. Design Choices and Expertise
The SIDARTHa system uses emergency care data to monitor health threats. The project
researchers divide it into four data sources: emergency medical service (EMS), emergency medical
dispatch (EMD), emergency physician service (EP) and emergency department (ED) data. Each
source has different properties that make it more or less suitable for inclusion in a syndromic
surveillance system. For example, the authors note that ED data are often collected electronically,
while EMS data are ﬁlled in paper forms that are then transferred to the computer, making the latter
more difﬁcult to connect to an ICT-based surveillance system [37] (p. 20). The authors also mention
that emergency data covers only severe cases, because patients with mild symptoms are not very
likely to call the emergency medical service or to visit an emergency department [37] (p. 22). At the
same time, emergency departments receive patients and respond to calls outside the working hours
of other health services [37] (p. 22).
The decision to use emergency data for syndromic surveillance has consequences for the types
of events that can be detected and for those likely to remain invisible. In this case, one consequence
is being able to detect severe cases and not being able detect mild ones. For example, the authors
state that “since gastrointestinal problems do not mainly lead to the need of emergency medical care
treatments, these outbreaks can only be identiﬁed by a syndromic surveillance system if the outbreak
occurs under special circumstances (i.e., symptoms in a group from abroad)” [42] (p. 15). The
system itself makes events that manifest with acute symptoms more visible. This is in line with
the vision of syndromic surveillance as a tool of preparedness for sudden, unexpected and highly
dangerous events. By beginning with the aim of detecting health threats and then setting up a system
that is suited to the detection of severe illness rather than mild illness, the designers contribute to the
deﬁnition of a health threat. In the previous examples, the health threat was a sudden event with the
potential to affect health, whereas now a health threat is speciﬁed further as an event that can cause
severe illness with sharp and sudden symptoms.
During the development of the SIDARTHa system, the ICT company, BeValley, programmed the
system to match the speciﬁcations of the designers. In the evaluation report, the authors state that
“BeValley agreed to adjust and update the system in the future, but the question remains how this can
be sustained also with additional funding” [42] (p. 10). They also ask: “If the regional system cannot
easily be repaired by the future users, how does that affect the usefulness and acceptance of the
system?” [42] (p. 11). The authors anticipate that future users in emergency care institutions will
have ICT staff who can install the software and program the data transfer [42] (p. 11), but they do
not elaborate on either whether emergency care institutions do in fact have such capacity or if that
capacity should be found within emergency care. The expertise required to perform public health
surveillance grows when SIDARTHa or a similar syndromic surveillance system is introduced, and
that new practice privileges ICT expertise more than before.
Finally, the work of classifying and sorting does not end with the programming and installation
of the system. During the data analysis study, Rosenkötter et al. [39] report numerous errors that
need to be resolved locally by the practitioners attempting to perform analyses based on emergency

93
data. For example, the authors ﬁnd that it is not possible to analyze unspeciﬁc syndromes using the
Austrian emergency physician service data due to repeated entries for the same incident, while using
the emergency department data, the only option is to analyze unspeciﬁc syndromes, because the
source does not list the reasons for care. The Belgium emergency physician service data arrive with
delay, causing difﬁculties in developing a syndrome-speciﬁc coding, and the emergency department
data is not possible to analyze fully, because the systems recording the data have changed recently.
The authors also describe the necessity of taking into account ICD shortlists used by physicians at
different sites. These lists lump the detailed categories of the ICD into larger groups, allowing the
physicians to quickly assign codes without referring to the extensive ICD documentation every time.
However, the mappings of these shortlists differ from site to site, and they do not combine easily
when centralizing the data. It is not possible to ignore the shortlists either, because similar cases may
be assigned to different syndromes if the mappings in the shortlists are not taken into consideration.
Although these events may sound like exceptions to the rule of smooth classiﬁcation, as Bowker and
Star [29] point out, the work of classiﬁcation always includes these complexities and tensions.
4. Conclusions
We have demonstrated how a discourse of syndromic surveillance constructed the health threat
concept as a sudden, unexpected event with the potential to cause severe harm and one that requires
a public health response. Based on our analysis of reports from the SIDARTHa project, we stated
that when creating surveillance technologies, design choices have consequences for what can be
seen and for what remains invisible. We argued further that syndromic surveillance discourse
privileges expertise in developing, maintaining and using software within public health practice, and
it prioritizes standardized and transportable knowledge over local and context-dependent knowledge.
ICTs are not value-neutral tools; they privilege some forms of action, and they limit others.
They are imbued with values, and different people beneﬁt or suffer from their use differently.
Latour’s deﬁnition of technology as “society made durable” [45] underlines the potential of ICTs
to stabilize existing social processes. Leaving design decisions unexamined can perpetuate current
epidemiological classiﬁcations, which may already be problematic [46]. Furthermore, Fearnley states
that “[s]yndromic surveillance itself, with its orientation towards unexpected events and nonspeciﬁc
objects, inevitably moves epidemiology in new directions.” [27] (p. 84). French’s analysis of ICT
use within public health deﬁnes some of these new directions:
[. . . A]n over-arching immaterial conception of information imbues some kinds of
information with more import, for surveillance, than other kinds of information.
Speciﬁcally, this conception encourages the collection of abstract, digitized signiﬁers,
while simultaneously marginalizing other kinds of embodied, contextual information.
Indeed, the pursuit of immaterial information for public health surveillance produces a
dominant but superﬁcial epidemiology at the expense of other potentially more effective
epidemiologies. [28] (p. 6)

94
Syndromic surveillance systems are not costless solutions, because gathering information and
sustaining surveillance require work. They also require a different kind of expertise not always found
in public health institutions. Moreover, syndromic surveillance relies on a particular deﬁnition of
health threat, which focuses on catastrophes and rare events. The practice of syndromic surveillance
contributes to a shift in broader public health practice, and although this is not problematic in itself,
since practices can always change, the question remains: what does syndromic surveillance mean
for fairness? If it orients public health towards the detection of catastrophes or sudden events with
severe consequences, what happens to other types of events that do not produce such signals? For
example, to what extent can syndromic surveillance deal with chronic illness or aid those who suffer
from health issues due to poverty? Public health practice is a large ﬁeld, and there may be a place
for different surveillance systems that monitor different types of illness. However, discussions of
syndromic surveillance should not stop at sensitivity, speciﬁcity and timeliness, but also address
questions of fairness.

Managers’ Identification with and Adoption of Telehealthcare
Jane Hendy, Theopisti Chrysanthaki and James Barlow
Abstract: This paper presents managerial attempts at implementing telehealthcare. Our longitudinal,
ethnographic case studies document both successful and failed implementations across five
health and social care organisations in England. We draw on theories of organisational identity,
sensemaking and sensegiving to highlight how managerial organisational identities can inhibit the
uptake of digital health technologies. Managers who strongly identified with their current role at
work felt threatened by the intended change; a telehealthcare mode of care delivery. When a
strongly identified workforce agrees with this assessment, managerial and employee sensemaking
and sensegiving coalesce, forming a united front of resistance that prevents further adoption of
the innovation.

1. Introduction
A key agenda for governments worldwide is how best to care for older people, whilst limiting
the demand for expensive hospital and nursing home beds. One solution is the development of
digital technologies that support care remotely, often in the patient’s own home; commonly called
telehealthcare. Despite a strong policy push and the espoused potential of this technology, uptake
has been slow with health services yet to show that implementation of digital health technologies
can result in a significant and sustainable shift in care services from hospital to home [1].
We have been conducting research into the progress of the UK’s telehealthcare programme
since its inception [1–3]. In terms of understanding and changing this position, the UK has taken a
strong lead, particularly with the commissioning of the largest randomised controlled trial of
telehealthcare services; called the Whole System Demonstrator programme [4]. Our results from
this study have yielded mixed results [5–8]. The findings presented here represent another untold
facet in telehealth story by considering how staff tasked with adopting this new technology
responded to this demand.
Health services constantly need to innovate and evolve to survive, while keeping their staff on
board. However, we know that adopting innovations that essentially alter or are in conflict with
organisational members’ current ways of thinking and acting are complex; individuals need to
engage in a process of negotiation to balance the demands posed by these old and new types of
identity causing many planned changes to fail [9,10]. The UK public sector, in particular, is littered
with high profile examples of costly digital failures [11]. Repeated attempts to produce
transformational changes across this sector all demonstrate the severe difficulties associated with
the introduction of new ways of working in this domain [12].
In this paper, we were interested in exploring the apparent paradox between the much heralded
advantages of telehealthcare [13] and apparent difficulties in achieving wide-scale adoption of this

99
digital health technology. Despite a growing interest in telehealthcare, we know little about how
organizational members have perceived and responded to this innovation, in terms of anticipated
material changes in their work (such as interacting more remotely) and their occupational identity.
Our case studies represent five large public sector health organizations. All the organisations were
simultaneously charged with developing mainstream telehealthcare services. Implementation was
accompanied by a list of significant changes in patterns of resource allocation, cultural changes in
the professional ethos and work practices in the current form of care delivery to meet the new
environmental demands aligned with the telehealthcare vision [1,3].
2. Theoretical Framework
In trying to unpack these innovation adoption attempts literature has elaborated that for change
to succeed organisations need to go through a process of identity transformation [14]. Both
managers and employees must disengage from the past and embrace the future [15,16]. To achieve
this shift the cognitive template or interpretive scheme, shared by managers and staff [17]
regarding the organization’s visible face, activities, structures, and goals [18,19] needs to be
reorientated or replaced. This reorientation typically involves “unlearning” or the “destruction” of
central assumptions within the existing schema, enabling members of the organization to assimilate
new beliefs and assumptions associated with the new strategy [18,20].
At an organizational level, beliefs about “who we are” as an organization reciprocally influence
beliefs about ourselves. The organization creates a context for individual identity and self-beliefs,
while individual identity-beliefs are the foundation upon which collective organizational
identification is built [21]. Therefore, although these two aspects of identity may subsist as distinct in
a conceptual level, in the social world individual and collective identities are not always easily
separated; they interact to the extent that they share attributes, serve similar psychological functions
(self-verification processes) and grant each other meaning [22]. It is the level and function of this
dialectical relationship and perceived compatibility between them in the light of an innovation that
induces identity transition, or threat. It was the expression of these concepts, embedded within
managerial narratives that we are interested in.
Innovation may set about a process of disruption that alters the existing identity status quo and
triggers the need for sensemaking [23]. Sensemaking is the process that fundamentally sustains
and generates individual and organisational identity [14], through the creation of mutually shared
understandings around questions, such as who are we, what are we doing, and why does it
matter [24]. Once shared meaning or sense is broken, new sensemaking needs to take place [25].
In organisational contexts, negotiation around achieving this task largely falls to managers; their
sensemaking efforts and abilities are needed to legitimate and reorientate the cognitive scheme of
other employees [26,27], thus, the assumption is where managers lead others will follow. Managers
need to reconstruct a meaningful framework for understanding the nature of an innovation (in our
case telehealthcare) in order to maintain and generate their organisational identity in light of
potential disruption [28]. As the most visible members of an organization, managers [28,29] also
need to facilitate new sensemaking and organizational identification in other employees [16,30].
Fiol [14] suggests managers facilitate major identity transitions in other members by reducing the

100
value of the current organizational identity, before going on to provide members with something
new to believe in.
In some organizations, the sensemaking of change recipients closely aligns with the vision
provided by management [29]. In other cases, the initial strategy formulated by managers is merely
a starting point for an employee’s sensemaking [18]. An employee’s constructed identity and the
wider organizational identity in which they are situated are likely to overlap, but not necessarily
closely align [31]. In recent debates about how consensus in sensemaking emerges, social
interactions with others are highlighted as essential to this process [25,32,33]. Consensus is reached
through a process of sensegiving [28]. Sensegiving is the means of influencing sensemaking in
others, of shifting them towards a preferred construction of reality. Managers, by the virtue of their
role, primarily take on this sensegiving task. Managers give legitimacy, face validity and desirability
to the new frame [34] allowing other employees to consolidate the meanings, gain entry to new
groups [31] and construct new possible and “desirable” selves [35]. People may affirm positive
aspects of the organisation if it corresponds with their own cherished views of themselves, if it
bolsters their need for self-consistency, self-esteem and belonging [36].
In an organisational context employees will be proactive in protecting the “target” of their
ownership [37]. Experiencing psychological ownership of a shared organisational identity of a
group or sub-group, with fierce group loyalty and competition between those in the group and
outsiders [21] implies a feeling of possessiveness and strong emotional ties to the organisation [38].
However, if a change in work is perceived as a threat to this “target”, people may resist, utilising
sensemaking tasks that cognitively (and sometimes behaviourally) disengage and distance
themselves and others from the proposed organisational aims. In extreme cases this dis-identification
work may lead to a sense of separateness with employees actively discrediting or even breaking
their ties with the organization its ideas or members [31]. Hence, by default managerial narratives
and strategies to cope with unexpected or top down induced forms of change in the context of
adoption of telehealthcare are the focus of our study.
3. Methods: Case Study Design and Selection
We wanted to remain open to the messy reality that emerged, having said this, we also pursued
pre-existing theory as the driver for our research design. Since organizational change is a process
that takes place over time, we sought to elaborate a “process explanation” [39] unpacking the
dynamics relating to sensemaking, sensegiving and identification over the course adoption
processes covering five years.
We were concerned with assessing the impact of managerial identity on the adoption of digital
health technology, thus, we needed a range of cases that would provide potential variation. The UK
Government had given £80 m to public services providers in England to develop telehealthcare
services. From a national sample of 151 possible organisations in England and with government
advice we were able to identify a set of cases which were considered national front runners. These
five sites were contained within this sample as they had a range of managerial strategies and team
compositions (using either external or internal staff to organization) for implementing the change
require; the development of new telehealthcare services. Identification of these five sites was done

101
over a six month period through the systematic use of a range of channels (sites publicizing research
on a national telecare website, meetings with experts, conferences, site visits, phone calls,
government databases, interviews and from project documentation). To enhance generalisability,
demographic variability was also taken into account. Two sites were large counties in the south of
England. One site was a large county in the north of England. One site was a large metropolitan
area on the middle of England. One site was a London borough.
4. Data Collection
We were given full access to the data available across our five sites and an open invitation to
visit. To preserve anonymity and confidentiality we have assigned fictitious names to the sites. We
used a range of ethnographic methods [40]. In each study site we attended events such as project
group meetings and other strategic meetings and observed rollout of telehealthcare services and
team decision-making (a total of 170.5 h of observations ranging from an hour to a whole day in
duration). These observations played a fundamental role as we developed our understanding of the
changes unfolding for the managers and other staff members. As soon as we gained access to the
sites we attempted to identify and attend as many key events as possible in order to engage with
locally meaningful practices. Each visit was recorded in field notes on the same day to record
chronological progress, as well as the observational field notes of the visited sites [41]. All our
visits to the sites were non-participatory in nature but we did attempt to create a sense of trust with
our informants that would prompt them to freely share information and interpretations.
We relied on a number of other sources in our story building. We examined freely available
documents (n = 17) such as annual reports and management meeting minutes concerned with
telehealthcare implementation. We conducted many informal discussions with managers and other
stakeholders throughout the period of our study, and in addition conducted formal interviews (over
five years from April 2006–June 2011).
We wanted to assure representation across the organization’s hierarchy and functions, which led
us to the following choices. After the managers and their teams were interviewed, we assigned a
roughly equal number of interviews for each of the five sites making sure a representation of other
staff were selected and matched in terms of role (n = 90). These included local authority and health
services staff. Participants were the Chief Executive and other Project Managers, Directors of
Service, Commissioners and Senior Nurse Practitioners. We wanted access to those informants who
were actively managing the telehealthcare implementation because of their formal position, as
well as those who were identified by others as likely change recipients. This ensured we gained
a well-rounded picture of adoption efforts, allowing room for resistant voices, as well as the voices
of champions [42].
The interviews typically lasted one to two hours, were tape-recorded and transcribed verbatim.
The interview protocol contained a number of questions regarding the sites’ current telehealthcare
position, likely future position, telehealthcare strategy, and the interviewees’ own work roles,
motivations, commitment and actions within this context. Interviewees were also encouraged to
pursue any topics they regarded as relevant.

102
5. Data Analysis in Five Rounds
Our analysis followed the principles of grounded theory [43], progressing from a very detailed,
empirical reading towards greater abstraction. Our practices for analyzing and presenting the data
were also inspired by the qualitative work of Gioia and his colleagues [16,26,28]. The analysis
progressed in five rounds. The first round involved detailed contextual analysis of past history; how
previous telehealthcare change efforts had progressed. This built a baseline from which strategic
progress could be assessed. We then began the process of building a grounded theory. Strauss and
Corbin [44] suggest that grounded theorizing begins with a fine-grained reading of the data—a
practice which they call microanalysis. We began our analysis by writing a detailed account of the
current change effort from the viewpoint of managers. We sought to give a rich account of what
had transpired. We catalogued and temporally ordered the data, and used published official sources
to construct a recent event history of what had transpired. We coded what appeared to be important
events in the implementation process. We proceeded to integrate the views of different stakeholders
by using non-public texts and interviews. As the richness of our data allowed for triangulation, we
augmented, criticized and structured more public narratives with non-public texts.
During the third analysis round, we coded the data on the basis of the theoretical account we
had taken, with pure induction balanced against our initial sensemaking framework. The
framework guided our field work and data collection, but we were cautious not to be de-sensitised.
The aim was to construct new and emerging narratives. To achieve this we used a narrative strategy
of qualitative process research [39], constructing multiple interwoven stories from our data. This
narrative story building required that data and theory be constantly compared and contrasted.
Evolving theory directed attention to the efficacy of our conclusions made while new data focused
attention on the suitability of our conclusions.
Finally, during our four and fifth round of analyses, we integrated the previous rounds into an
overall explanation of sensemaking, identification and re-identification and adoption success and
failure at the sites, introducing our theoretical vocabulary into this framework [23,28,29]. Over a
period of six months five levels of analysis and coding incorporating over 100 pages of text
emerged before the final conclusions were revealed and data saturation was achieved. Overall
assessments were validated by two researchers and further validated with the informants
themselves. These conclusions were further validated by an independent analyst who was asked to
code a selection of randomly chosen extracts (about 20%). A high level of agreement was
achieved. Our preliminary findings were then further validated by being presented at twenty one
conferences attended by representatives from local authorities, health authorities and the industry
supply chain implementing or considering implementing remote care. There was broad agreement
with our interpretations.
6. Findings
Firstly, we measured the rate of success of telehealthcare implementation. This is illustrated by
the number of people in each site using the new service (see Table 1). User numbers is an easily
comparable metric, indicative of other associated complicated organizational changes, such as the

103
development of new call centres, new staff roles and training to support these new users. Variation
across our five sites was large. User numbers increased and strategic change successfully
progressed, in Newhall and Canton, and to a lesser extent in Dinham. Samridge and Sunning failed
to further implement telehealthcare services, with telehealthcare user numbers gradually decreasing
(see Table 1). In an attempt to understand what may explain these differential levels of adoption
across our five sites, the next sections discuss how the strength of managerial organisational
identity, experiences of work process control through participation in decision making and a sense of
possessiveness towards the organisation frames what constitutes “success” and determines local
adoption rates of telehealthcare. Empirical evidence on the impact of organisational ownership is
incomplete, but initial work suggests that extremely high levels of psychological ownership may be
counter-productive when attempting to promote innovation as members may feel threatened and try
to defend their “turf” [38].

* Numbers of telehealthcare users include those with home monitoring systems (the frail elderly, with for
example falls detectors or motion sensors) and health monitoring systems (for those chronic conditions
such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease).

The strength of managerial organisational identity was assessed by exploring each participant’s
length of service, and their organisational commitment and identification with telehealthcare
work [45]. This information was extrapolated from the interview data. The aim of this method was
to assess participant’s strength of organisational identity and explore how they conceptualised
this tie. The interviews covered questions such as the desire to remain affiliated (commitment),
the use of elements of the organisation identity to oneself (identification) and alignment with
organisationally shared goals and values. Finally the participant’s sense of ownership regarding
their current work, the organisation and the proposed strategic change (telehealthcare
implementation) was explored [37].
7. Managing Innovation in the Context of Identity Change
Samridge is the case that is most surprising in terms of its failure to deliver a telehealthcare
service. The site had £1.5 m of funding, an experienced committed manager and team of five
support workers, yet over a two year period they managed to decrease the number of people
receiving this digital health technology. The manager (Mark) was highly identified with the both

104
the telehealthcare work, and the organisation, “to succeed means everything to me”. He proudly
described himself as actively being involved in an innovation that was distinctive, unique and
prestigious and described the great value of this to others. Mark expressed being personally
responsible for previous strategic successes and taking sole charge of the telehealthcare, “they need
to realise that if they got rid of me the programme would collapse because I’m everything, I’m very
closely identified with it.” However, the organizational decision to move forward on a larger scale,
and invest large sums of funding on an expanded service meant he was no longer in sole charge.
“I loved doing the telecare work but now I’ve been told it’s going to be over my
head—And now I’m not so sure I believe in this anymore—I felt happier about the
changes to our working practices when I knew I had a hand in how things were
being run.”
His esteemed identity, as the person in charge appeared under threat [29], through the prospect
of dismantling the current scheme with another, the exact details of which were unknown to him.
He expressed that the continuity and future of his role and the work of his immediate team was in
jeopardy. Mark was unable to reconcile the new change with his previous role and he is inclined
to distance himself from the membership that is being challenged noting an “obvious and
non-negotiable mismatch” [30] between himself and the values of the organisation.
“I now longer have any faith that they know what it is they are doing—All this new
health care service—It needs real staff on the ground to run it—And now they seem to
not understand that anymore—And I feel they are just not caring about the people they
service—And I’m not sure I want to keep going with this anymore and my values and
theirs’ don’t match-up.”
Mark’s team strongly identified with organisation, yet construction of identity content is, not an
individual endeavour, nor a matter of personal choice. We know that identification processes are
inextricably linked to individual and organizational relations with others [46]. The making of one’s
desired self at the workplace is a highly complex process and often a contested endeavour,
negotiated through dynamic social interactions between group members, managers, organisational
informants and other stakeholders holding differentiated positions [31,46]. Organisations are made
up of a large number of groups and subgroups with different social identities and group prototypes,
which provide individual members with many different opportunities for the development of new
identities or joining existing organisational groups, where ingroup members share similar ideas
and attitudes. However, it is the manager, usually the most visible member of an organisation,
who has the power to facilitate, support or block entry to organisational groups, and, through
their sensegiving efforts, provide legitimacy, face validity and desirability to belong to a group
membership [31,46]. According to Mark the meanings and values associated with the new
proposed telehealthcare identity are not only ambiguous but also undermine the current position
and vision of the group. In an attempt to ameliorate the threat and its negative consequences Mark
created a small but salient sub-group identity.

105
“We’ve increased our numbers of staff. We’re going to get a fifth member. We’ve got
other people, but they’re, not negative as such, about the service, but I don’t think they
fully understand the implications, or necessarily share our, my vision.”
Although the group identified with the organisation, work members often self-categorise first at
the level of their subunit—Their department or immediate work group—Because of task
interdependence, interpersonal proximity and similarity [47]. The team closely identified with
Mark, and Mark’s sensegiving was highly effective. His desire to maintain control and separate
himself and the team from others resonated. Once part of a desired group, people’s self-definition is
enacted with reference to the group, and the member will follow the groups values, norms and
beliefs [46] working in concordance with the group identity to enhance and maintain self-esteem
levels. A large part of this behaviour will consist of engaging in favourable intergroup comparisons
to accentuate the ingroup similarities and remain positively distinct from other groups [48]. The
proposed organisational changes were translated by Mark and communicated to his team as a threat
to the group’s systems of values and beliefs. Mark’s status and power legitimised his right to pass on
a negative judgement about the proposed organisational changes creating a temporal sense of loss
and anxiety within the team which he successfully dealt with by insisting that the team should
protect themselves from others to maintain control. A type of battle mentality emerged, a “them
and us” divide that had not existed before. A subgroup of aspirational remote care experts ready to
‘fight’ their battle and lead implementation in their own way emerged.
“I don’t want to work with others on this anymore—I feel we are the only ones
who understand the nuances of implementation and other groups just don’t really get
that—So I fight to keep this here and if I can’t then I think we will just give up.”
Over time this “giving up” and overall lack of identification with the new telehealthcare led to
implementation failing to progress (see Table 1). Mark and his team made no attempt to widen
participation to others, there was a lack of cooperative spirit, with rigidity and the embattled
attitude eventually leading to a reversal in telehealthcare uptake.
In contrast, staff at Sunning appeared from the outset to have low organisational identification
with the organisation and with their immediate work group and little commitment to telehealthcare.
This appeared largely due to organizational restructuring, which happened just before and during
and the study period. Nearly all staff had had to reapply for their jobs, with heavy job losses
reported and staff reporting “it is the worst time ever known here”.
“It hasn’t been easy because everyone is in a state of flux at the moment. We are going
through a big structural reorganization. So everyone working for health is very nervous
at the moment because they know that jobs are going to be cut and nobody knows
yet who.”
Staff were disillusioned, and by the end of the study identification and trust within the
organization and telehealthcare work was at “an all-time low”, with staff expressing that the
reorganization meant the end of working life as they knew it, and many staff leaving of their own
volition. In the chaos the manager in charge of implementation was replaced twice.

106
“The idea of working together and all that working practice stuff, is really key in
getting to where we are, but he’s now been replaced by someone else. It’s that’s
understanding, all lost, it was kind of like we had to start again, and we just can’t do it.”
Staff turnover meant that sensemaking and sensegiving did not have continuity, and staff
became largely indifferent to the telehealthcare, apart from how it affected them personally. There
was also a growing lack of any belief in telehealthcare or trust in the organization’s agenda
surrounding the technology. Without individuals’ to champion the benefits or the technology
people appeared reluctant to believe in it or engage, resulting in very little being achieved.
“We have got kind of rogue voices, who were quite against doing anything at all.
They would turn up to meetings but didn’t want to get involved and wouldn’t sign up
to anything.”
In Dinham the “battle” to provide people in the district with basic provisions was spoken about
with evangelical zeal. Staff who worked at Dinham were “on a mission” and were proud to be
“making a difference”. The high level political support at the time pushed telehealthcare services
further up to the local agenda and added not only to staff commitment and pride but also to the
“determination” to succeed.
The manager (Peter) in charge of telehealthcare implementation and the chief executive officer
expressed enthusiasm for the task ahead, but there was a lack of knowledge about how the task
could be achieved. Peter was given operational responsibility for achieving the strategic change but
early on experienced a loss of credibility within his team. With the stakes high due to the concerted
political interest Peter also expressed internal doubts about his abilities. External credibility with
colleagues was further dented by a failed bid to gain additional funds from the UK Department of
Health. A lot of effort had been put into the bid and failure was taken badly. As stated by one
senior practitioner and member of the team the overall impression was that Peter was a “good bloke”
but lacked the experience needed for the task of implementing telehealthcare organization-wide.
This lack of belief made Peter vulnerable and the task of implementing telehealthcare and
sensegiving the benefits of this change to other employees hard. Other staff did not take Peter
seriously and some organizational members were openly hostile. This lack of trust in Peter’s
abilities and uncertainty about the innovation itself largely contradicted the actual progress made
over the course of the study (see Table 1). Despite the setbacks and with political support on board
there was significant progress, but overall rate of success was hampered by Peter’s own lack of
belief in his ability to lead, and offer sensegiving that provided members with a sensemaking
foundation from which to move forward. As Weick, Sutcliffe and Obstfeld [24] explain,
sensemaking is driven by plausibility rather than accuracy. The drafting of an emerging story
requires robustness, in order to be resilient in the face of criticism. The sensegiving did not appear
enough to counteract growing scepticism in the value of telehealthcare care and concerns about
how it would impact on people’s work. A process of excitement, and action was, thus, followed by
feelings of exhaustion, uncertainty, inaction and gradual loss of confidence in dealing with the
complicatedness of the task in hand [49]. Realisation that building a single and coherent

107
organisational vision may not be either plausible or desirable in the current context emerged as
infighting and worry about the “new roles” set in.
“There’s the S curve where you have a rise in expectations and excitement and then you
have a huge trough where things start going wrong and you know, people are getting
tense and nervous.”
In Newhall the chief executive office decided to parachute in an external consultant and his team
to drive the change through (see Table 1). Newhall had a highly identified and loyal workforce.
Newhall is one of the most deprived areas of the UK, with high crime and a prevalence of older,
sick people (those too poor to move away). Staff in Newhall were, again, highly committed to
improving things. The chief executive in Newhall was highly respected and his choice of
management strategy was universally accepted by other staff and paved the way for a radical
programme of change.
“We are trying to drive this programme so it becomes business as usual from the start,
and the last thing I want to do is set up separate organizations because then it becomes
self-perpetuating, and the whole idea and the whole reason why we use consultants is
so that a future point we can take them away and share it to everybody else—And drive
it into the mainstream.”
The consultant and his team did not identify with the parent organization, seeing themselves as
outsiders. The lack of a strong organisational identification allowed the external team in Newhall
freedom to quickly set about dismantling the existing interpretive scheme, getting rid of areas of
doubt about technology myths and “hidden management agendas” winning over sceptics. By
interpretive scheme we mean organisationally shared central assumptions and beliefs about the
organisation that define and legitimise its goals and activities [19].
“I feel it’s up to me to decide how to make this programme work—And so I am going
to led on this and make it work for us—I will decide how we will deal with sceptics and
I will sort out the men from the boys when it comes to delivering the new model of
care—And it will be a new model—My new model.”
Despite this freedom, there was concern over employee resistance. The team expressed how
they worked tirelessly to provide new roles and identities and reduce any anxiety related to changes
in work practices [50]. The consultants addressed feelings of uncertainty regarding individual’s
professional roles by emphasising the importance of individual jobs, and the organisation’s need
for employee input to decision making, in terms of building an increasingly vital and forward
thinking organisation that would serve the future needs of the community beyond the project
deadlines. The consultant (Matt) clearly stated that he felt his job was to align employees with the
ethos of the organisation and its goals, as opposed to his own goals.
“I feel we need to get people on-board with the strategic vision around all this—It’s not
about my way but about the way forward for this organisation and we need everyone to
start leading on this and getting exciting about it.”

108
Managerial sensemaking activities were mobilised on a huge scale, with different managerial
strategies employed at different phases of implementation. In the early phases of implementation
rhetorical and symbolic strategies were widely used. New names were given to the initiative, and
media and marketing campaigns were started. Sensegiving focused on persuading other
stakeholders to embrace the new change, with telehealthcare positioned as a new and exciting
development that would enable people to live better lives at home. We observed negative
rhetorical strategies [14] (p. 664), with no attempts made to devalue previous working and care
delivery processes.
At a later stage rhetorical strategies were further supported by shared social actions, such as the
creation of new work roles, and involvement of different stakeholders in tasks such as workshops
and training. In the final stage of change, for identification to become secured and newly learned
understandings to gain purchase both types of strategies were consistently evoked, allowing for no
backward slippage [28]. These sensegiving tasks (such as workshops, training days, conferences
and media communications) provided stability and a framework for schema replacement and the
development of a new organisational identity. Staff started to think of themselves as part of the
scheme and identification and inclusion in the telehealthcare initiative quickly became
a desired goal.
“I think it gives the work status and gives us an edge if you like. We are seen as being
forward thinking and as being at the front. This is good for everyone here so I said
count me in.”
These strategies were most effective when combined with a fast pace of the change [28], and the
sheer level of combined activity was perceived as critical, leaving members no opportunity to
reflect or fall back on previous ways of working. Alongside the changing political and local
narratives, the innovation itself and its desired outcomes evolved. Telehealthcare was initially
concerned with delivering pilots, but to be scaled up it also needed to be a clinically safe alternative
and a potential money saver. Matt expressed that this was hard message to sell.
“There’s a big divide. We’ve breached it in many places, but it’s hard work and it’s
very quick to open up again if you don’t keep looking after it.”
In Canton, like Newhall new managers were brought in to lead the change, but unlike Newhall
staff were new internal members of the organisation. The CEO felt that new people could be
“different enough to have the freedom to innovate and actually show that different things will, and
can work. And they do tend to learn from each other”.
The organisation was perceived as highly innovative and as having a charismatic and
entrepreneurial leader. This leadership had brought positive and radical changes to the organisation.
The sheer force of the CEO’s personality and trust in him allowed the new appointments to be
initially accepted without resistance. The new managers took full advantage, solidifying their new
role with action. They requested funds (>£2 m), and they set about buying large amounts of
telehealthcare equipment. Despite the CEO’s support this action was poorly received, especially
when the process of implementation slowed. Trust between the managers and other members of the
organisation was under scrutiny, as the technology failed to live up to expectations and deliver

109
expected benefits in the time frame originally espoused. New “them and us” divides started to
emerge. The new roles had tenuous legitimacy, and the managers received little support from the
internal staff who perceived them as being “for themselves” rather than working for the good of
the organisation.
“Those people do focus on the equipment and buying things because it looks so good.
You see something and say, that’s great. But what are you going to do with it? They
don’t actually know! It was a bit toys for boys, and I’m sceptical you have to do a lot of
work to integrate that technology into the actual service delivery to achieve the value.”
The CEO response was to create four new posts to support the change. These posts were filled
by esteemed internal members, with their work role and duties reassigned. The creation of the
support posts had strong symbolic meaning, giving needed legitimacy to the new work. The action
enabled the work to be seen as more integral to the organisation. New levels of personnel also
enabled the managers to increase their sensegiving activities, with a large media campaign
extolling the virtues of the new service model for clients.
“We’re on the journey of trying to change our approach-to how we view the public,
how we’re dealing with our resources, how we try and create and provide opportunities
for people to be more independent. And it’s about the role of what we can offer them in
support of that.”
This new sensegiving moved away from previous dialogues concerning the “extravagant
spending” with the change successfully reframed as “a change for good”. With these new activities
further implementation progressed well.
8. Discussion
By studying the messy process of organisational identity and its impact on telehealthcare
adoption, not just as the change is being instigated but throughout the change period and across five
large public sector organisations, we develop new insights. Our findings support the argument that
the dynamics between individual and organisational identities both support and undermine digital
technology adoption efforts. Levels of ingroup identification played a key role in determining how
the proposed organisational change (telehealthcare) was perceived, the levels of threat experienced
and the choice of responses for improving the integrity of the organisational identity and the local
management of implementation.
In our case study Samridge, the manager who most strongly identified with the innovation felt
threatened by the intended change [14,29]. Via sensegiving this threat was then transferred to an
equally strongly identified workforce. The high level of agreement that telehealthcare was
threatening resulted in the manager and his workforce coalescing to form a united front that
prevented further adoption. Many studies have described sensemaking efforts in the context of
externally induced unfreezing [14,16,29]. In this case, sensemaking was not focused on actively
unfreezing the prior interpretative scheme but appeared collectively used as a method of
undermining and creating more scepticism, whilst legitimating specific self-conceptions [51]. All

110
attempts to alter managerial control with organization-wide standards and procedures were
negatively communicated and seemed largely ignored. The impact on telehealthcare implementation
was devastating, despite £1.5 m of additional funding, there was a reduction in telehealthcare users
from 300 to 233.
We found organisational attempts to redefine work roles and loosen identification were inhibited
by past experience and already solidified identities. The strategic decision to legitimise early work
by giving individual managers increased status and control was problematic and painful later on.
Initially, the actions led to an increased passion of the telehealthcare initiatives, with managerial
identities and the telehealthcare increasingly intertwined. This deep connection and ensuing state of
psychological ownership initially enabled the organizations to drive forward—people were
enthused and committed. Later the move from pilot projects, run by individual managers and
self-managing teams, to organization-wide initiatives required an individual’s shift in identification
and ownership; either explicitly via relinquishing control of the decision-making to another
authority or through more tacit forms of control over problem definition, implementation strategy
and execution. At this point strong identification and possessiveness became problematic. Being
seen as a pivotal part of the telehealthcare implementation became a preferred self-conception [35,46],
a valued source of identity meaning and self-esteem. Moving to organization-wide development
was threatening; it meant the potential loss of this desired self. In addition to individual identity
threat, the organization’s identity was often damaged by the technology itself not matching many
of the apparently over hyped expectations. We observed many people excitingly engaging, then
later emotionally disengaging, as the “gut wrenching reality” of poor adoption outcomes became
“too much to bear”. Managing expectations and supporting a collective (organisation wide) rather
than an individual level of psychological ownership from the start might have lead to better
implementation outcomes.
In Dinham, organizational identification was strong, both individual members and the manager
in charge of leading the change were committed to telehealthcare, supportive of the innovation
and proud of the organizations achievements. Yet, identification processes negatively impacted on
strategic change, initially at a localised level. This localised effect then spread across the
organization. The problem was situated in a lack of trust in the manager (Peter) assigned with the
task of implementation. Identification is based around trust [52].Trust is a psychological state of
positive expectation about another’s motives and future actions [53]. Staff did not believe in Peter,
and subsequently they did not believe in the telehealthcare technology, despite the fact there had
been some progress. This led to Peter questioning himself and created a negative interactive spiral,
with implementation strategies too risk adverse and conservative to create the environment to
support wide level of implementation required by the organization.
Similarly, in Canton, trust and the perceived legitimacy of the managers became an issue when
implementation slowed. Newly appointed managers had the freedom and vision to move beyond
traditional organisational boundaries, without feeling personally threatened by the change.
However, this strategy carried risk. Staff who do not highly identify with organisation can be
perceived by other members as “outsiders” and as lacking legitimacy. This inherent danger was
acknowledged and addressed in Newhall right from the outset. Managers in charge of

111
telehealthcare were external consultants, who capitalised on their positions, in not being strongly
identified or strongly identifying with the extant scheme. They set about successfully dismantling
the old scheme and setting up the new, with rapid and radical action. Throughout this action, the
managers were very mindful of the need to build trust, and internalise ownership of the
change [37], with a large range of sensemaking tools and co-opted actions utilised to strengthen the
legitimacy of the new interpretative scheme.
To replace the old scheme “people needed something new and bold to believe in”—telehealthcare
care needs to deliver promised benefits and quell concerns about future working practices. To
create this whole new bold world, a new language was utilised and further reinforced with
behaviour and symbolic artefacts. For example, the organizations gave the telehealthcare initiatives
new names, gave members involved important sounding new titles (i.e., Telecare Programme
Director) engaged in widespread marketing to constituent users and other stakeholders, and gave
staff new roles. The tactic was one of inclusion [26], the action to work hard and to work quickly,
leaving no room for reversal. This risk was conceptualised by managers in both Newhall and
Canton. Until the new identification was concrete, the residual effect of the previous cognitive
scheme remained strong, so unattended members could quickly fall back on previously learned or
relatively automatic behaviours and ways of thinking, even after the change process was enacted.
9. Conclusions
Crucial to the process of achieving acceptance of digital health technologies is the process of
negotiation, of sensemaking and sensegiving between managers and members. As the case of
Sunning demonstrated, some level of identification with the technology is required for
sensemaking and sensegiving activities to take place. Additionally, with the technology itself also
delivering the expected benefits. The final outcome depends on managers and members negotiating
and renegotiating what the technology means to themselves and others [42,50]. Alignment and
consensus needs to be reached for strategic action to take place, but it is the ongoing sensemaking
and sensegiving negotiation aspect process that is pivotal to make it a success.
10. External Generalisability
Our focus has been on the relationship between identification and telehealthcare in public sector
innovations. The unique nature of our setting and our inductive qualitative inquiry does not mean
that “naturalistic generalization” is not plausible and some knowledge cannot be transferred from
our study sample to a wider population which may have subtle differences in other organizations
and settings. This said our sample was large, theoretically informed, and appropriate to our
research question. We ensured rigour by sampled from different organizational levels: senior
management, middle management, senior and operational practitioners with our data not limited to
one organization or profession. But our data collection was not exhaustive, and we adopted
qualitative methods and used purposive rather than random sampling. To overcome these
limitations, we maintained a systematic approach to our research rigour at every stage of the study,
in our design, sampling, analysis and interpretation.

Exercise as Labour: Quantified Self and the Transformation
of Exercise into Labour
Chris Till
Abstract: The recent increase in the use of digital self-tracking devices has given rise to a range of
relations to the self often discussed as quantified self (QS). In popular and academic discourse, this
development has been discussed variously as a form of narcissistic self-involvement, an advanced
expression of panoptical self-surveillance and a potential new dawn for e-health. This article
proposes a previously un-theorised consequence of this large-scale observation and analysis of
human behaviour; that exercise activity is in the process of being reconfigured as labour. QS will
be briefly introduced, and reflected on, subsequently considering some of its key aspects in relation
to how these have so far been interpreted and analysed in academic literature. Secondly, the
analysis of scholars of “digital labour” and “immaterial labour” will be considered, which will be
discussed in relation to what its analysis of the transformations of work in contemporary advanced
capitalism can offer to an interpretation of the promotion and management of the self-tracking of
exercise activities. Building on this analysis, it will be proposed that a thermodynamic model of the
exploitation of potential energy underlies the interest that corporations have shown in self-tracking
and that “gamification” and the promotion of an entrepreneurial selfhood is the ideological frame
that informs the strategy through which labour value is extracted without payment. Finally, the
potential theoretical and political consequences of these insights will be considered.

1. Introduction
The recent increase in the use of digital self-tracking devices has given rise to a range of
relations to the self often discussed as quantified self (QS). In popular and academic discourse, this
development has been discussed variously as a form of narcissistic self-involvement, an advanced
expression of panoptical self-surveillance and a potential new dawn for e-health. This article
proposes a previously un-theorised consequence of this large-scale observation and analysis of
human behaviour; that exercise activity is in the process of being reconfigured as labour. This is
not, however, an ontological argument suggesting that exercise is inherently labour. Rather, it is
proposed that in our present context, exercise and labour are in a process of merging in such a
fashion that in a short space of time, the two may seem inseparable. This position was arrived at by
thinking through the similarities between the activities undertaken by self-trackers and those
discussed as “digital labour” [1]. A significant amount of the novelty of this position is derived
from focusing the analysis on the strategies of the corporations who develop and control
self-tracking devices rather than the users themselves. The main reason why it is proposed that
digital tracking devices are having a considerable impact upon how exercise is understood is

117
because of their ability to objectify and standardise the activities and capacities of heterogeneous
bodies in such a fashion that value can be extracted.
This article will first introduce QS and consider some of its key aspects in relation to how these
have so far been interpreted and analysed in academic literature. Secondly, the analysis of scholars
of “digital labour” and “immaterial labour” will be considered in relation to what its analysis of the
transformations of work in contemporary advanced capitalism can offer to an interpretation of the
promotion and management of self-tracking of exercise activities. In the third section, the analysis
will be built around two key analytical axes of a thermodynamic model of energy and that
“gamification” and entrepreneurial selfhood are proposed as the ideological frame of commercial
interest in self-tracking. Finally, the potential theoretical and political consequences of these
insights will be considered.
2. Quantified Self
There has been a significant increase in the use, and particularly the sale, of devices or smart
phone applications that enable the tracking and analysis of various aspects of everyday life. Most
prominent amongst these are devices, such as the Nike+ Fuelband, FitBit and Jawbone Up;
bracelets with built-in accelerometers that can track the distance the user has travelled, how many
steps they have taken and other aspects of their activity. These activities are transformed into
digital data, which are uploaded to servers owned by corporations, where they provide users with
tools to analyse their progress and share their information with other users. In exchange for these
services, the corporations collate data on their users, which can be used for various marketing and
other purposes. A number of groups have developed around the use of such devices, most
prominently a loose global network of quantified self “meetups” or “show and tells”, during which
users of devices or techniques present the novel ways they have developed to track, analyse and
interpret their bodies, moods and other aspects of their lives.
These devices and their users are of increasing interest to academic researchers, and work has
been conducted particularly in the field of human computer interaction [2], which has explored the
potential of applications for tracking anxiety [3], sleep [4] and the relationship between health
tracking and social networks [5]. The majority of the work has developed out of previous analyses
of e-health and m-health predominantly in health promotion and health communication circles [6].
Some literature has focused on the potential for automisation, personalisation of information or
prompts and the development of online support communities [7] (p. 330). A range of studies has
explored the efficacy and potential of dietary and physical activity interventions through digital
tools [8–12], and the wide-ranging implications of “Web 2.0” technologies have been surveyed [13].
Some ethnographic approaches to the use of information technologies in a healthcare setting have
been attempted, in particular analysing the ways in which they are implicated in social practice [14],
although this approach has not yet been taken to the more informal and commercial technologies
and practices central to this study. Even studies focusing on “consumer e-health” have not so far
dealt with the use of digital data and health data collection devices [15].
Although published work in the social sciences and humanities so far is limited, there have
recently been a number of conference presentations that have often focused on surveillance [16], as

118
well as notions of the “calculating self” [17] and the relationship between self-quantification and
neo-liberal philosophies [18]. In the still relatively sparse published material, the theoretical
implications of the use of such methods of digital self-analysis has been explored in relation to
issues of surveillance and self-surveillance [19–21] and notions of “gamification” [22]. Perhaps the
most well-developed published sociological work is that of Deborah Lupton, who has suggested
that self-tracking and QS can be read in terms of:
x
x

x

x

A “body-machine” metaphor with the body defined in terms of quantified “inputs” and “outputs”
with self-trackers positioned as “experimenters” on their own bodies [23] (pp. 26–27).
An expression of neo-liberal entrepreneurialism, enabling self-maximisation and promoting
self-critique and responsibilisation through the presentation of “objective” measures of
performance [23] (p. 28).
Practices of “prosumption” characteristic of the use of Web 2.0 in which users are both
consumers and producers of digital media content, which is the context for the constitution
of virtual and physical communities [23] (pp. 28–29).
A means through which a particular kind of reflexive approach to the self is enabled through
the analysis of data and the imperative to control these data and oneself [23] (p. 29).

While I agree there is a lot of potential in interpreting self-tracking activities along the above
axes, and I would consider this article to complement these approaches, there is an important aspect
of such practices that has yet to be theorised. This supplement to the above analyses was arrived at
largely through an engagement with the literature on digital labour.
3. Digital Labour
While all of the devices that are used for exercise and health tracking, and some of the apps,
generate income through sales for the corporations who provide them, it is clear that the data that
are produced are also valuable. Some prominent figures in QS have been calling for the companies
who produce the devices and apps to allow the users greater ownership over their data [24–26].
Currently, the data generated through tracking are tied up within corporate walls, making it difficult
for individual users to merge data from different devices in order to gain a more holistic picture of
their health. Nike, Jawbone and the other corporations have so far not been enthusiastic about
doing this. In recent years, the value of user data to corporations has become clear. While it is not
yet fully known how corporations are using these data, Nike and Fitbit have both stated that while
they do not sell personally identifiable information, they may do so with aggregate data or share with
others within their “corporate umbrella” [27].
While this kind of sharing could effectively function as the de facto sale of commercial data,
clearer sharing between companies has recently been unearthed. A study of twelve mobile health
and fitness apps conducted by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission found that user data were
disseminated to seventy-six third parties, and one app in particular sent data to eighteen other
entities [28]. In addition to information, such as names, email addresses and usernames, twenty-two
of those third parties received details on consumers, such as exercise information, meal and diet
information, gender and geo-location [29]. A similar study by web analytics and privacy group

119
Evidon commissioned by the Financial Times found that the twenty most popular health and fitness
apps share information with almost seventy companies. In particular, MapMyRun was found to
transmit data to eleven companies, some of which were advertising firms [30].
Another route by which these data may be shared is through corporate takeovers. When fitness
tracking app Moves was purchased by Facebook in April, 2014, they announced that their data
would not be “commingled” with one another. Within two weeks of the purchase, they changed
their terms of service and privacy policy to state that they will share data with Facebook and their
other affiliates [31]. Perhaps most telling, an analysis of the privacy policies [32] (pp. 73–78) of
many of the most popular health and fitness tracking apps and devices found that most were
ambiguous on whether they permitted sharing of user data, with most allowing “non-personally
identifiable information” to be passed on. Such aggregated data would be of great value for
advertising. Corporations have not divulged for what purposes these data are being used, but we
already know that the billions of dollars that companies, such as Facebook and Google, have made
over the last decade have been generated largely from selling advertising space on the basis of data
collected on their users. The character of Web 2.0 media is such that users are usually both the
audience for, and producers of, media content and so are therefore targets of advertising and
responsible for drawing in an audience who is exposed to advertising.
A significant literature has developed trying to understand the implications of the use of this
“digital labour” or what Tiziana Terranova [33] called “free labour”. Terranova has suggested that
the kinds of activities conducted online are symptomatic of “an acceleration of the capitalist logic
of production” [33] (p. 46). The profitability of sites, such as Facebook, is dependent upon the
users and “the cumulative hours of accessing the site (thus generating advertising), writing messages,
participating in conversations and sometimes making the jump to collaborators” [33] (p. 48). This
“free labour” generates vast amounts of income, but is not paid, because the corporations have
successfully convinced users that it is leisure, not labour, through an erosion of the distinction
between work and play [1] (p. 2) and the formation of what some have called “playbour” [34]. The
clicks, “likes”, purchases and posts performed by users as part of their everyday usage of the
Internet provide valuable data, which can then be sold on to advertisers.
Critiques of digital “free labour” have been significantly influenced by autonomist Marxist and
Operaismo work on the “social factory” [35] and “immaterial labour”, which tried to deal with the
consequences of the decline in traditional forms of productive labour in Western countries and the
rise in knowledge economies. As described by the autonomists, the context in which “cognitive
labour” has increased in prominence can be characterised by the emergence of increasingly
precarious forms of intellectual and affective labour. The rise of this kind of labour has seen the
dismantling of the structured, bounded, restricted, waged workday governed by rules, obligations
and expectations [36] (p. 26). The twentieth century, “modern” form of work organisation is being
replaced by decentralised, temporary employment in which work is often intricately intermingled
with creativity and self-realisation, making it increasingly difficult to differentiate between work,
leisure and individual life projects and easier for corporations to benefit from “free labour”. The
analysis of “digital labour” and that of the autonomist Marxists is predicated on the assumption that
labour is not only that which is paid formally through wages. Rather, many forms of activity

120
generate value, and there are forces at work that coerce people into accepting the necessity of
engaging in such productive activities for little or no pay.
The theoretical approach taken in this article has some affinity with that in studies of the
“commercialization of leisure time”, which highlights not only that that the line between work and
leisure is increasingly blurred, but that the notion of leisure time itself is at least partly a product of
the capitalist organisation of work [37]. Capitalism has reformulated people, not only as workers,
but as consumers who decreasingly have the means to engage in leisure activity without
consumption. Thus, the commodification of leisure time is seen as being intimately linked with
proletarianization and the extraction of surplus value [38] (p. 218). Moreover, the activities of
leisure come to increasingly resemble those associated with work; this fusion of “working time”
with “leisure time”, both for worker and capitalist, is aided by the kind of work associated with
“immaterial labour” [39] (p. 98). The contemporary orientation of capitalism towards the extensive
appropriation of subjectivity and social relations that is captured in the notion of immaterial
labour [40] finds particularly fertile ground in the digital world [41].
The fundamental aspect that is of significance for this article is the creative and open view of
what can be defined as labour in the above analyses. In one sense, digital labour can be seen merely
as a particularly advanced form of the division of labour dominant in the twentieth century, with
the individual tasks of writing posts and liking photographs distributed between many different
people. This is, however, quite different from a traditional factory production process in which the
product is designed as an end-point and the production process broken down into individual
elements that are distributed among many hands, because the product of most digital labour is data
on its own producers. Even the most complex and advanced products of conventional labour are
not as inherently tied to their distributed production process as the data generated through digital
labour. In very few circumstances could the product of digital labour exist as a valuable commodity
outside of the processes of its own collective production. The production of digital labour is its
product. Before applying this analysis to digital self-tracking of exercise, it must be established
precisely what is meant by labour in this case.
In the following section, I will describe how a similar process of the accumulation of labour in
order to enable its standardization and quantification is being applied to exercise activity through
the use of digital self-tracking devices.
4. Self-Tracking
With the use of digital self-tracking devices, we are currently witnessing the transformation of
individual health activities into quantified forms ripe for the extraction of value with a variety of
health apps and tracking devices. We can easily see exercise in any form as a type of “formative
activity”, which, as Sayers [42] (p. 435) states, could be to “change the character of animals or
people” as much as to give form to raw materials. It is clear that people see their achievements in
exercise (whether in the form of medals or rankings in professional or amateur sport, lifting
particular weights or running certain distances) as a certain kind of objectification of their labour,
which they recognize as embodiments of their abilities. While exercise may not always be
productive of economic value, it certainly often produces objectified embodiments of the labour

121
exerted and entails shaping and changing the character and body of a person, usually one’s self.
While there are many kinds of satisfaction that can be derived from exercise, certainly a major one
would seem to be the objectified measures of achievements. A central aspect of the success of
self-tracking devices and related analytical software has been virtual versions of such measures of
achievement. Many applications offer “badges” or “medals” for achieving goals, with some, such
as Strava, encouraging competition by awarding titles, such as “King of the Mountain”, for the
quickest time cycling up a particular hill [43]. The satisfaction gained by some in attaining such
achievements is clear, and the use of such methods has been called “gamification”, to which I will
return below.
The quantification of particular exercise activities for individuals, then, has benefits that are
largely consistent with older analogue forms of self-tracking and quantification, such as measuring
distance run on a map, counting and logging the amount of press-ups performed or the logging of
scores and positions in a squash or football league [18,44]. Digital self-tracking systems automate
many of these processes, enable more minute measurement (in some cases) and, in particular,
enable a greater amount of people against whom performance can be compared. The benefits to
corporations are, however, of a completely different order: the commodification of exercise
activity. Previously, the commodification of exercise activities had always taken a largely indirect
approach. To take running as an example, capitalist enterprises have made money from running as
an activity through the marketing of products, such as running shoes or t-shirts, which are
purported to improve performance or make the activity more comfortable.
Through the large-scale quantification of running enabled by digital tracking devices, however,
the activity itself is being turned into a form that is amenable to the extraction of value. In the past,
the actual activity of running was only of value to the individuals themselves, and this could only
indirectly result in economic value, except for professional athletes. When exercise activities are
quantified in a standardized form that is amenable to comparison and accumulation, corporations
can use the associated data in order to extract surplus value. Just as the clicks performed by
individual Facebook users contribute towards the production of useful data for advertisers, so do
the exercise activities performed by users of Fitbit or Track My Run. We can, then, see the
quantification of exercise activities through digital self-tracking as a method of enabling the
“accumulation of labour” in order to prepare it for the extraction of surplus value. Users of such
devices have thus been convinced to pay for the chance to give away their productive labour to
corporations who will use it to generate customer profiles to be sold to advertisers who will then
target the users with more products.
What are the consequences of a theoretical approach that conceptualizes the labour of self-trackers
or self-quantifiers as labour? To my mind, this kind of analysis is necessary regardless of how we
might like to conceptualise exercise activities that are tracked; they are labour, because the
corporations are treating them as such. Surplus value will be extracted from these activities by
corporations, as if they were work; if we do not recognise it, then we cannot challenge it. To
approach digital self-tracking of exercise activity as a form of labour, therefore, is to “follow the
medium” [45] (pp. 26–27). This may potentially lead to a reformulation after which (at least, for
some people) exercise activity is deemed to be more worthwhile if it is being tracked, accumulated

122
on a server and mingled with the data of other users. Furthermore, there may be further
consequences (which will be explored below) with regards to what constitutes labour. Literature
addressing the commercialization of leisure time [37–40] has suggested that the boundaries
between labour and non-labour have been blurred; this has intensified with the commercialization
of self-tracking data.
If the position presented in this paper is acknowledged, then there may be a situation of
perpetual commercial reinforcement between work, exercise and advertising. The focus on
productivity in self-tracking draws it conceptually closer to commercial imperatives than other
forms of commercialization of leisure time, even when commerce is not directly involved. We can
see this in the ways in which personal tracking and employer monitoring are converging, as
exercise tracking apps are always in some sense productivity monitors. Moreover, digital and
mobile productivity apps, such as DeskTime, are also increasingly being used by employers to
monitor, and employees to prove, productivity. One app, iDoneThis, started as a “personal
productivity tracker for weight reduction” and is now used as a subscription service business
management tool. As Phoebe Moore [46] has shown, such techniques and technologies are being
used by a variety of large and diverse organisations, such as Tesco, Amazon and the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency, to track the productivity and health behaviour of employees
in order to intervene and improve both. These initiatives are, however, not simply panoptic,
authoritarian surveillance by employers. Rather, they are couched in terms of a mutually beneficial
situation that improves the health and wellbeing of employees, as well as increasing productivity
and lowering costs for employers [47,48]. While these “corporate wellness” strategies emphasise
that employers must take action, this tends to be in the form of enabling and encouraging
“complete lifestyle and behaviour change” [49] in employees.
Those concerned with employee health have discovered useful tools in digital tracking
technologies with “employee wellness programs” being reported to be one of Fitbit’s fastest
growing areas of expansion [50]. The data produced by devices, such as Fitbit, are conducive to
existing techniques of corporate management in which workers are managed in terms of their
quantified measures of productivity. A corporate wellness program implemented by BP America,
which distributed free Fitbit devices to employees, spouses and retirees, helped to reduce their
healthcare costs to below average growth rates in the U.S. [51]. In these cases, any line between
what is beneficial for the profitability of the company and the health and wellbeing of the employee
is thoroughly blurred, and as the health data generated on employees become more comprehensive
and thoroughly integrated into the financial concerns of the company, the distinction will become
even hazier.
This is, then, perhaps best characterised as “syndromic surveillance”, or the real-time monitoring
of patterns through “automated data acquisition” [52], which has brought together health and
commercial data in new ways. Public Health England conducted research [53] that drew on
supermarket purchase data largely from loyalty cards to identify the supermarkets that had the
highest levels of purchases of “unhealthy”. Their analysis was used to target interventions to reduce
obesity. It has also been reported [54] that data brokers are selling consumer data on transactions to
healthcare providers, which is being used to create profiles on current and potential patients. These

123
data may include purchases of food and cigarettes, as well as gym memberships. The distinction
between health and commercial data is becoming unclear, and the techniques of profiling and
prediction used by marketers, healthcare providers and public health are converging. A potential
outcome of this could be that our health, and potential future health, will increasingly become
defined in relation to complex data that we generate in a variety of different contexts.
As I see it, this article complements and adapts the four key aspects (outlined above) of
Lupton’s analysis of self-tracking: that there is a “body-machine metaphor” at work; it is an
expression of “neo-liberal entrepreneurialism”; it is characteristic of “prosumption” practices; and
it is an enabler of a particular approach to self-reflexivity [23] (pp. 26–29). By approaching
the exercise activities associated with self-tracking as a form of labour, these four analytical
axes are modified slightly. It is on the first two (“body-machine metaphor” and “neo-liberal
entrepreneurialism”) that I will concentrate, however, as these are the most significant to
this analysis.
5. Thermodynamics and “Gamification”
The body machine metaphor suggested by Lupton [23] (pp. 26–27) is certainly present in
descriptions of QS in the media and other representations, and this may well be how many users
perceive their relationship towards themselves as mediated through their devices. Lupton’s use of
this metaphor is informed by Donna Haraway’s [55] theorisation of the “cyborg”, which she used
to capture the contemporary assemblages of humans and technologies. The integration that
wearable devices have with the body enables the cyborg to develop ever further and to constitute
new relations with the body and others. It is, however, the notion of the body as a series of codes,
which Haraway proposed in relation to discourses of disease, which is particularly enlightening
here. As Lupton [56] demonstrates, data produced through self-tracking appears to render the
messy, disordered body as clean and orderly and give us the tools to maintain control through an
objective view of the body.
While the body is often conceived of in terms of inputs and outputs of energy by individuals, the
corporations, by constituting users as workers in a distributed digital exercise factory, are working
on a different model. Rather than the individual exerciser being considered as an isolated, molar
individual, they are seen as an expression of universal energy, as a generator of data. In order to
understand this, we need to think in terms of a thermodynamic metaphor based on energy and what
methods of analysis have enabled this model. According to the thermodynamic model, the universe
contains a fixed amount of energy that can neither be created nor destroyed, only harnessed or not.
For George Caffentzis [57], energy became central to the management of work from the nineteenth
century onwards. In early capitalism, the key tension between capitalists and labour was hours
worked; in the nineteenth century, this shifted to an issue of “productive intensity”, or, how to
transform the workers’ energy into work. This was seen to be fundamentally similar to the notion
in theories of thermodynamics that “if a mass is exploding, you should give it a way out so
organized that it will push a piston and thus do work for you” [57] (unpaged). In order to
harness this energy, there needed to be a form of analysis; it needed to be “caught, fixed, and
serialized” [58] (p. 39) and could, therefore, be quantified. By making physical work able to be

124
perceived as a series of isolated movements, this new approach presented the human body as a
“thermodynamic machine” [59] (p. 30) with “work” (in terms of labour and physics) seen as a
manifestation of the “energy” that underlies all of nature. The exercise in which many people
engage for fitness purposes has (in capitalist terms) been wasted for decades. Digital self-tracking
is an ingenious means by which energy that is being expended anyway can be analysed and
transformed into productive, profitable (unpaid) “work”.
This analysis develops the body-machine metaphor that has previously been applied to self-tracking
by taking the analysis below the level of the individual body to think in terms of the energy used by
collections of bodies. Thinking of the body in terms of energy or data performs similar functions as
it reduces particular bodies, or actions, down to a common, universal, abstract quantifiable
substance. It is possible to understand the actions of those engaged with exercise data, whether
individuals, governments or corporations, in terms of the harnessing of potential energy, which
requires knowledge of the energy expenditure of the individual. Furthermore, this has the impact of
aggregating a population in terms of their energy. Quantifiable measures, such as those generated
through self-tracking, provide the potential to compare and accumulate individuals into a
generalized mass.
In order to make this labour productive, however, the corporations cannot stop at the point of
merely tracking existing exercise, but must encourage exercise and structure it in such a fashion
that it is useful for their purposes. The virtual achievements associated with “gamification” may be
determined by what the corporations think customers want (supply and demand), but are also
driven by what kinds of data they want to generate and, therefore, the kinds of labour in which they
want users to engage. “Gamification” here helps to explain not only how people are drawn into
engagement with systems of production, but how their “work” is managed in a decentralized,
distributed “factory”. If we consider the issue of “gamification”, not in terms of the pleasures
enabled (although these are significant), but in terms of the productive labour generated, then we
see that “[i]t isn’t play that creates its own games; it is a game that extracts labour in the form of
play” [60] (p. 74). This “gamification” can, then, be seen as encouraging a kind of neo-liberal
entrepreneurial self, which is “amenable to improvement, an object of personal enterprise and
work” [23] (p. 28).
We can further see the relation between exercise and labour as the kinds of “gamification”
employed in self-tracking converging with that used in management practices. Some have
suggested that gamification could be almost a panacea for the problems faced in the contemporary
workplace, tackling stress, reduced sense of community, reduced loyalty and a rapidly changing
workforce [61]. A senior Microsoft director has proclaimed that “play is the future of work” [62],
and gamification will enable work to become a freeing and creative process. The rhetoric of these
approaches is one similar to a gift economy, where employees giving a little extra in their daily
work in return for the pleasure they gain from the experience of the game. For McKenzie Wark,
however, this is a distinctly imbalanced exchange, where “what is offered is a bit of cognitive
energy that performs a task some vectoral business requires, and the reward is only a formal and
abstract kind of token and ranking” [60] (p. 74).

125
When the activities that are being “gamified” produce commercially useful data, this can be seen
as a form of division of labour, which is most widely seen through “crowdsourcing”, in which a
task is divided between a vast number of people in order to gain a quick or cheap result. While this
kind of labour organisation has often been traded on the goodwill and enthusiasm of the public for
scientific experiments and other “worthy causes”, when harnessed for commercial purposes, it can
be seen as a type of “labour arbitrage” [63], a “neoliberal system of exception” [64] (p. 91) or
simply work that does not need to be paid. To highlight that these data are or can be valuable to
corporations does not deny its usefulness to users just as the “critique of exploitation does not devalue
individual pleasure any more than such pleasures nullify exploitative social relations” [65] (p.153).
Furthermore, self-tracking devices have been shown to tend towards individualization and the
solidification of existing economic and political divides [66] (p. 81).
We can, therefore, see the thermodynamic harnessing of potential energy latent in the population
as the labour model underlying the commercial interest in tracking exercising bodies and
“gamification” and the promotion of an entrepreneurial self as the strategies through which labour
value is extracted with minimal payment. It now leaves us to consider what the potential theoretical
and political consequences of these insights might be.
6. Consequences
Some might accept the conceptualisation of exercise activities as a form of productive labour,
but be less willing to deem it a significant problem, given that it is generally engaged in freely; the
users enjoy and benefit from it, and users tend to be relatively prosperous, unlike some others who
experience more severe extraction of their “free labour” (see, for instance, Amazon’s “Mechanical
Turk” [64]). The success with which corporations have been able to convince people to reconstitute
their exercise activities into productive labour and to give it away freely may encourage them to
expand this project in as yet unimagined ways. Indeed, there have already been proposals to use
digital self-tracking devices in order to monitor traditional workplace activities [67]. Furthermore,
while the kind of exploitation of labour that is occurring in this case may not be of the most serious
kind, there are structural and analytic similarities with the highly exploitative kind of labour
relations, which should be highlighted [67] (p. 155). If it is agreed that these labour practices are
problematic, then they would need to be tackled multilaterally. The commercialisation of
exercising bodies in the form we have been discussing could have potential ramifications for how
such activities are conceptualised in the long term. While I have focused on exercise in this article,
it is true that any tracked movement could be considered as productive of valuable data. I have
concentrated on exercise because corporations are demonstrably interested in the tracking of
exercise data, which also has clear commercial value. Moreover, there are potentially specific
conceptual consequences to the tracking of exercise, since, just as the constitution of a “like
economy” or “click economy”, in which value can be extracted from users’ everyday interactions
on the Internet required a process of enclosure, so is this occurring in the present case.
The early Internet was often spoken about in utopian terms as a free “commons”; this has now
been extensively “enclosed” and turned into a private space kept within the walls of Facebook or
Google. Today, the vast majority of people engaged with the Internet have many of their social

126
interactions mediated through commercial, enclosed spaces managed by corporations. Such
corporations are only able to appropriate value through “capturing and controlling components of
the productive infrastructure” [65] (p. 155) of the Internet. If a similar process of enclosure is
occurring through digital self-tracking devices, the “productive infrastructure” that is being
captured and controlled is, at least in part, the productive bodies of the population. These are forms
of exercise that were previously undertaken, usually for reasons of health, socialization or personal
development. Commercialization could have a significant impact on how such activities are
perceived and experienced. Early and enthusiastic adopters of digital self-tracking already report a
disengagement from exercise that is not being tracked.
The analysis in this article could make a contribution towards the ongoing theorisation of
“immaterial labour” by problematizing the distinction between material and immaterial as
self-tracking highlights that all of the work undertaken as “digital labour” is corporeal on some
level. While “cognitive labour” has been considered to be particularly amenable to the kinds of
“labour arbitrage” [64] (p. 91) ,which exploits “immaterial labour” through creating a “system of
exception” in which particular activities are deemed unworthy of payment, the present case shows
that there is nothing to stop “material labour” from being organised along similar lines. This insight
perhaps points to the material aspect of all “immaterial labour”, even if, in some cases, this appears
to be merely the pressing of keys or clicks of a mouse. We might, therefore, consider to what extent
digital self-tracking has the potential to contribute towards resistance to capitalist appropriation.
The transformation of exercise activity into a quantified form has similarities with traditional forms
of labour organization in the sense that it provides a way to realize our collectivity. The value that
corporations extract from exercise collectively enables users to see their exercise activities as
something more than merely individual activity. Just as the “collective knowledge work” that
occurs in the digital economy demonstrates the “collective aspect of labour [which] implies a
rejection of the equivalence between labour and employment…[and shows that]…[l]abor is not
equivalent to waged labour” [33] (p. 45), so could “collective exercise work”. The labour engaged
in by self-trackers is both “knowledge work” and “physical work”, “immaterial labour” and
“material labour”, if indeed we require distinctions between the two.
Those engaged in the QS community are much closer to this kind of resistance than the more
casual self-trackers who use “off the shelf” devices or applications. While part of this more creative
approach to self-tracking is due to the “hobby-ist” and “techie” tendencies of many people involved
in QS, it is also in response to issues around the management of data. While much of the academic
literature assumes that the biggest issues for those in the QS community are around surveillance
and self-constitution, some of the more vocal members seem to be equally interested in the control
of data. In particular, some have attempted to find ways to enable users to manage their data online
through open-source software [25]. There have also been particular critiques [26] of how the
infrastructure of self-tracking devices and services works. Currently, individuals have little
ownership over their data, because the companies that produce each device they use want to tie
users into their “ecosystems” of online analytics services and social networks. It has been
proposed [26] that they should hand the data over to the users, making it easier for them to control

127
how their data are used and who has access to it and making it more feasible to combine data
streams from different devices.
The developments discussed in this article, therefore, suggest a problematisation of the
immaterial/material distinction and of what constitutes work labour. The critique offered by
operaists demonstrates that the boundary between work and leisure has been collapsed and has
sought to demonstrate that the activities they classify as immaterial labour are indeed labour, but a
different form to traditional material labour. Their focus, however, was on the products of the
labour process, in which case, approaching the two kinds of activities as distinct makes sense.
Material labour produces material goods, while immaterial labour produces immaterial goods. If
we focus on the process of production, however, this distinction seems less meaningful, as material
and immaterial goods both require physical activity of some kind, whether this is the pressing of
keys or firing of neurons. Similarly, if indeed exercise activity can be considered to be labour that
produces material goods (in the form of the transformation of human bodies) and immaterial goods
(in the form of data), is this distinction between material and immaterial still meaningful?
We might also consider the potential impact of this analysis on the ways in which health in
general is conceptualised. If digitally tracked and quantified exercise activity can be formulated in
terms of labour, does this mean that all exercise activity should be? In the case of self-tracking, it is
politically important to consider this reconceptualization, because exercise activity is being
structured in such a fashion as to have economic value extracted from it. While the activity of
exercise has always been able to produce certain use values (e.g., improved health, development of
skills), it is only because it is being tracked and accumulated along with the data of others that it is
able to produce exchange value in the form of commercially valuable data. As studies have
shown [30,32], data from health and exercise apps are being shared not only between entities under
the same “corporate umbrella”, but with external companies. It is important to remember that it is
the standardization through quantification in the process of digital tracking that enables exercise
activity in this case to be formulated as a collective, distributed form of labour. This is not usually
the case in everyday, untracked exercise activity, and it is probably not desirable to consider it in
these terms. Significantly, the value that is produced through tracking is likely to be derived from
its value in generating promotional data, and it is perhaps for this purpose that exercise activities
are tracked, quantified, accumulated and analysed. Nevertheless, if the tracking, quantification,
accumulation and extraction of value from exercise activity continues to grow, it is possible that
the definition of what constitutes worthwhile exercise may become increasingly aligned with
commercial imperatives.
As an increasing amount of exercise activity is tracked, accumulated and analysed, a conceptual
distinction may develop between those activities that are and are not capable of being quantified.
Might we come to distinguish between exercise that is productive and unproductive of data? This
could speak of a new kind of commercialization of exercise that is much more pervasive than the
production and promotion of sports equipment, for instance, but brings the bodies and movement of
amateur athletes itself into the commercial infrastructure. If the actual movements of the exercising
body are generating valuable data, this might change the ways in which people (as well as

128
corporations) engage with exercising bodies. There could be a developing expectation that we will
be producing valuable data when at work, when exercising and when at rest.
7. Conclusions
The few sociological approaches to digital self-tracking have tended to focus on surveillance or
the micro-level impact on individuals and their relationship to the self. These have been valuable
and look likely to inspire useful empirical work; however, a focus on the macro level tactics of the
corporations who are largely in control of the data provides different insights. By considering
self-tracked exercise activity in terms of its corporate value, we can see how it is digitized,
quantified, accumulated and analysed in order to generate commercially valuable data on the
population. These data are particularly valuable to the corporations who are collecting it, because it
has been ideologically constituted as “not work” and, therefore, not being worthy of payment. It
has been suggested above that there are “structural similarities” between the “digital labour” or
“free labour” that is conducted online and the digitally-tracked exercise activities of users of
self-tracking devices. When approached through a Marxist frame of analysis, it is possible to see
the digital tracking of exercise activities as a form of the accumulation of labour, which enables the
extraction of surplus value. The transformation of exercise activities into digital data enables
individual users to see their activities as a particular kind of “formative activity” through the
representation of their achievements as digital data in the form of statistics or “medals”, which
constitute a kind of objectification of the labour of the exerciser, which is relatively new to the
amateur athlete. For corporations who are compiling these data, however, by transforming
heterogeneous exercise activities into a standardized, quantified form, they are able to be made into
a valuable resource; data that can be sold to advertisers. The exercise activities in which people
engage are therefore seen as productive potential energy by corporations, who are likely to be using
the design of hardware and software to subtly structure the behaviour of users to produce the kinds
of data that will be of commercial value. Prior to the existence of easily available digital tracking
technologies, there were few ways in which everyday exercise activities could be quantified and
standardized in such a form that they are amenable to the accumulation and comparison of the data
of large amounts of people. These developments are currently in their early stages, but may be
indicative of not only a new form of surveillance, but an epistemological change in how exercise is
understood, as well as signaling the potential commercialization of the exercising bodies of
the population.

Apps as Artefacts: Towards a Critical Perspective on Mobile
Health and Medical Apps
Deborah Lupton
Abstract: Although over 100,000 health and medical mobile apps have been placed on the market,
few critical social analyses have been yet undertaken of the role of these apps in healthcare,
preventive health and health promotion. In this article I present an argument for approaching the
study of mobile apps as sociocultural artefacts, focusing specifically on those that have been
developed on health and medical topics. This perspective acknowledges that apps are digital
objects that are the products of human decision-making, underpinned by tacit assumptions, norms
and discourses already circulating in the social and cultural contexts in which they are generated,
marketed and used. First, I provide the context, by discussing the gradual digitisation of health and
medical information since the advent of the Internet and the emergence of health and medical apps
as one of the latest developments. Second, I discuss how a critical perspective may be employed to
analyse the social, cultural and political dimensions of health and medical apps. Finally I illustrate
how such an approach may be applied by giving a case study of an analysis of the top 10 ranked
health and medical apps on the Apple App Store on one day, outlining some major themes and
discourses that emerge.

1. Introduction
Mobile software applications (or “apps” as they are commonly known) have become an
important element of contemporary digital technology use. Millions of apps designed for
smartphones, computer tablets and other mobile devices have been published since their first
appearance in 2008. Apple announced in mid-2014 that it had over 1.2 million in its App Store
catalogue alone and that 75 billion apps had been downloaded by users. The other major app
provider, the Google Play store, provides a similar number of apps to consumers [1]. Market
research has found that mobile device users spend more time each year on using the apps they have
downloaded. One survey of adult smartphone users in the USA found that the average number of
hours respondents spent per month on using apps exceeded 30 hours, and that the respondents used
an average of 26 apps each [2].
Despite this rapid expansion of a novel method of providing software programs to mobile device
users, as yet very few critical social analyses of mobile apps have been published. In this article, as
part of a developing research program in critical digital health studies [3–10], I focus attention on
one genre of mobile apps: health and medical apps. The vast majority of research studies about this
genre of apps have appeared in the medical or public health literature or market research reports.
These studies take a primarily instrumental approach, seeking to review the effectiveness of apps or
analyse the medical validity or safety of their content using descriptive content analyses. The wider

135
social, cultural and political roles played by health and medical apps as part of contemporary
healthcare and public health practice and their contribution to notions of health, illness and
embodiment have been little explored thus far.
In this article I seek to achieve three objectives. First, I provide the context, by discussing the
gradual digitisation of health and medical information since the advent of the Internet and the
emergence of health and medical apps as one of the latest developments. Second, I discuss how a
critical perspective may be employed to analyse the social, cultural and political dimensions of
health and medical apps. Finally I illustrate how such an approach may be applied by giving a case
study of an analysis of the top 10 ranked health and medical apps on the Apple App Store on one
day, outlining some major themes and discourses that emerge. In so doing I introduce the concept
of the app as sociocultural artefact. This perspective acknowledges that apps are digital objects that
are the products of human decision-making, underpinned by tacit assumptions, norms and
discourses already circulating in the social and cultural contexts in which they are generated,
marketed and used.
2. Digitising Health and Medical Information
Health and medical apps are one of the newest developments in a trajectory of the digitising of
health and medical information that has occurred over the past quarter century [5]. The emergence
of the Internet and mass access to the World Wide Web in the mid-1990s (now often referred to as
the “Web 1.0” stage) led to a proliferation of health and medical websites and online discussion
groups offering open access to details about illnesses, diseases, health promotion and healthcare.
These initial websites were mostly static, infrequently updating their information. They offered
little opportunity for people to contribute details of their own experiences, although online
discussion groups allowed for some interactions and sharing of information by patients and other
interested users.
The digital technologies that have emerged in the past decade (now often referred to collectively
as “Web 2.0”, or “the social web”) have expanded the opportunities for people to access and, in
particular, share health and medical information with each other in digital forums. Patients and
caregivers can write about their experiences, create and upload images or videos and rate healthcare
providers and medical treatments using social media platforms and blogs and wireless mobile
devices that can connect to the Internet from almost anywhere. In this age of digital “prosumption”
(combining production and consumption of Internet content) [11], the ideal of the “digitally
engaged patient” (otherwise referred to as the “e-patient”) has become dominant. This ideal
represents digital technologies as offering patients and lay people the opportunity to ‘take control’
over their health via contributing to and harnessing online information and engaging in selfmonitoring and self-care practices using digital technologies [6,12,13].
3. The Emergence of Health and Medical Apps
Sociologists and other social researchers have yet to devote significant attention to the role
played by health and medical apps as contributors to these digitised landscapes and ecologies. Yet

136
these apps have proliferated in recent years as part of a constellation of new digital health
technologies that include telehealth and telemedicine, digital gaming technologies, digitised
medical education and health promotion materials, wearable devices to monitor and measure bodily
functions and activities, electronic patient records and booking systems and the use of large digital
data sets (“big data”) to generate knowledge about healthcare, health behaviours and disease
patterns (see [4,5] for an overview). Health and medical apps represent a major element of this
market. Tens of thousands of medical and health-related apps for mobile digital devices have
already been developed, and more are released onto the market each day. In mid-2014 there were
over 100,000 health and medical apps listed in the two major app stores, Apple App Store and
Google Play [14].
The health and medical apps that are currently available span a wide range of sophistication of
content and markets to which they are designed to appeal. Many are very simple, providing
information on a specific medical condition or treatments. Others involve highly detailed
anatomical visualisations or incorporate complex algorithms to assist in calculating diagnoses,
identifying risks or facilitating health and fitness self-tracking or patient self-care regimes. A
variety of apps that are currently on the market are versions of medical training and education
directed specifically at medical and other healthcare professionals and students. They provide
detailed anatomical information and visuals, digital versions of medical textbooks and dictionaries,
training videos and diagrams and drug prescribing information. Apps have been designed for the
medical market that can monitor and measure many bodily functions and symptoms in patients as
well as work with smartphones to conduct medical tests for diseases and conditions, including
add-ons that act as mobile medical devices. Hundreds of apps have also been developed by
hospitals and other healthcare providers to market their services and provide opportunities for
patients to rate their experiences.
Many more apps are marketed to lay people to provide medical and health information or assist
them in self-tracking of their bodily functions and activities. Others are directed at assisting
patients to store and access their medical records and treatment regimens and track medical
appointments, access medical trials, seek appropriate medical care, engage in patient support
networks and share information on their condition with friends and family.
The Internet empires are entering the field of digital health. In mid-2014 Apple announced its
new Health app that takes data on health and physical activities from third-party apps and
consolidates them into a comprehensive health profile [15]. In September 2014 Apple also announced
that its new smartwatch, the Apple Watch, would be released early the following year [16]. The
Watch will have its own App Store devoted to new apps that are designed especially for its
operating system. Among its other functions the Watch will act as a wearable health and
fitness-tracking device. As well as allowing users to use third-party apps the Watch incorporates
two new apps, simply entitled “Fitness” and “Workout, that will work with the embedded sensors
to track users” physical activities and body metrics such as heart-rate [17].

137
The Use of Health and Medical Apps
Evidence suggests that health and medical apps are becoming increasingly used in a variety of
contexts. Many writers in the medical and public health literature have drawn attention to the
benefits that health and medical apps may offer lay people as well as healthcare
practitioners [18–27]. While there is still little research on how people are using health and medical
apps, in late 2012 a Pew Research Center survey found that 85 per cent of American adults owned
a mobile phone. Fifty-three per cent of these were smartphones, and one fifth of smartphone users
had used their phone to download a health-related app. The most popular of these apps were related
to monitoring exercise, diet and weight [28]. A more recent market research study found that
almost one-third of American smartphone users (equivalent to 46 million people) had used apps
from the health and fitness category in January 2014 [29].
It would appear that healthcare practitioners and administrators are also increasingly using apps
as part of their professional practice [23,24]. A growing number of medical schools are now
offering at least part of their education via apps and require their students to own a tablet
computer [30]. In one study that surveyed American doctors, more than two thirds said that they used
apps as part of their work. Diagnosis apps were the second most-used category, following those for
medication interactions [31]. Another survey of medical students and junior doctors in a UK
healthcare region found that over half of both students and junior doctors had medical-related apps
on smartphones, with apps for medical education purposes the most popular [32]. Commentators in
the medical literature now often refer to “prescribing” apps to patients [33].
On the other hand, however, concern has been raised in the medical and public literature about
the quality of apps and the validity of the medical information they contain. Any developer can
publish a health or medical app, as long as they conform to the guidelines offered by the app store in
which they are seeking to publish (Apple is far more restrictive of the content of the apps it offers
than is Google [34]). As a consequence, health and medical apps vary wildly in the accuracy of
their content and the extent to which they draw upon credible and reputable sources of information.
Some app developers have longstanding reputations in online medical information and training
resources and provide information about their medically-qualified editorial team. However many
other app developers appear to draw on little or no direct medical expertise when generating the
information they present on the apps they offer.
This issue has been recognised as a major concern in the medical literature. Several studies
have been published that have identified significant problems with medical accuracy of apps’
content [20,35–37]. This research has found that many developers do not nominate specific
medical experts in contributing to the content, or are vague in their attribution of authorship, using
such terms as “doctors” or “a medical team” [38–42]. Other writers have sought to identify such
issues as legal and regulation difficulties and conflict of interest in relation to medical and health
apps [24,42–46]. As one commentator has observed, medical students are often presented with a
list of apps that they are required to use with no discussion of whether or not the developers of
these apps discloses conflict of interest. Yet there is nothing to stop a pharmaceutical company
developing an app for the medical market that recommends its own products [46].

138
The relevant regulatory bodies in many countries have not yet established guidelines and
regulations for overseeing medical apps. It has been contended that the content of all medical apps
should be externally peer-reviewed by medical professionals to ensure quality and safety [35].
Regulatory bodies such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are struggling to establish
the processes by which this should take place. In September 2013 the FDA issued draft guidelines
for the regulation of health and medical apps [47]. Many apps in these categories do not come
under these guidelines’ purview, however, as what is considered a “medical device” is currently
ambiguous, leading to confusion about exactly which types of apps should be submitted to the FDA
for review [48]. Furthermore, these guidelines do not attempt to cover the vast numbers of apps that
provide information on medical and health matters, meaning that consumers must exercise their
own judgement concerning the validity and accuracy of this information.
4. Critical Approaches to Health and Medical Apps
The sociomaterial theoretical perspective on technologies has offered valuable insights into
ways of thinking about the relationship between humans and nonhumans in the context of digital
health. This perspective has been most commonly articulated in science and technology studies,
and in particular, actor network theory. From this approach, technologies participate as material
actors in relationships with human actors to configure human-technology assemblages [49]. This
approach acknowledges the combination of the material and non-material, the human and the
nonhuman, the fleshly and the ideational in ever-changing configurations. It therefore recognises
the dynamic nature of people’s interactions with technologies in a world in which the digital is
increasingly part of everyday lives, social relationships and concepts of subjectivity and
embodiment [50]. Several sociologists have drawn upon the sociomaterial approach to theorise
medical technologies [51–55]. They argue that via these technologies, specific meanings, concepts
and practices are enacted in relation to health, disease, health care, public health, embodiment and
selfhood. Medical technologies facilitate modes of knowing the body and disease [52].
Apps are one of the latest forms of medical technologies. From the sociomaterial perspective,
mobile apps, like all technologies, are considered to assume certain kinds of capacities, desires and
embodiments; they also construct and configure them. Apps may be conceptualised as the products
of interplays between the human actors who make decisions about their form, content and use and
the affordances offered by digital technologies which delimit the scope within which apps can be
developed and used [34,56]. Apps are new digital technology tools, but they are also sociocultural
products located within pre-established circuits of discourse and meaning. They are active
participants that shape human bodies and selves as part of heterogeneous networks, creating new
practices and knowledge. They are therefore generative, a productive form of power [57,58]. Apps
may further serve political purposes by championing or supporting vested interests and established
forms of dominance and authority.
The technical affordances of apps structure the ways in which they are used and the meanings
that are ascribed to them. The mobility, ease of access and use of apps is a particular feature that
differentiates them from earlier sources of health and medical information. Due to their simple
format and location on mobile wireless devices, apps can be easily downloaded and carried around

139
for constant reference or updating the user’s own information or comments and sharing these with
others. The well-known motto of Apple—“There’s an app for that”—suggests the multi-functional
dimensions of apps. Many apps are free or obtainable for a small charge, and they are easily and
quickly downloaded (and just as easily removed from a device). Another distinguishing feature is
the function of many health and medical apps that connect them to sensor technologies in
smartphones or wearable devices that promote detailed and continuous monitoring of bodily
functions and behaviours. Unlike older-style websites, such apps are able to facilitate the
generation of constant digital data on the user’s body that can then be transmitted in real-time to
healthcare providers or carers or friends and followers on social media sites.
Apps also provide far more opportunities for lay people to access medical information that was
previously only available to healthcare practitioners or students, confined to medical libraries,
health and medical training and education course materials or professional associations. While
many medical apps are designed expressly for the healthcare practitioner and student audiences,
they are freely available for any others to download and consult. Indeed many apps have been
developed expressly by medical and public health authorities for the purpose of informing
members of the public about medical and health issues, such as infant care, immunisation, weight
loss, smoking cessation and many more [3,4,8,9]. Whether providing medical information or ways
for people to promote their health, apps contribute to public pedagogies on health and medical
matters [59]. A further important difference between health and medical apps and previous online
technologies is the issues they raise for the security and privacy of the often very personal
information that some of these apps generate about their users, given that these data are often
uploaded to the developers’ platforms supported by cloud computing.
All of these features and affordances of health and medical apps require critical attention and
theorising. As sociocultural artefacts and actors in social networks, the content and use of health
and medical apps can tell us much about which types of illnesses and health conditions are
considered important at a particular moment and what medical or health promotion strategies are
privileged to prevent or treat these conditions. Various types of capabilities and responsibilities are
produced via medical and health apps. They have significant implications for the practice of
medicine, medical authority, the delivery of healthcare and public health work and the
doctor-patient relationship. These apps have the potential to shape the ways in which the human
body is understood, visualised and treated by healthcare workers and non-professional people alike.
In several recent studies I have conducted on health and medical apps, I have adopted a critical
approach to the analysis of these technologies. For example my study of sexuality and reproduction
apps designed for people to use for self-tracking and monitoring purposes found that concepts of
reproductive and sexual embodiment as they were represented in the apps were strongly gendered,
supporting norms and assumptions about male and female sexual and reproductive bodies. Male
sexuality was rendered as ideally high-performing and competitive, unrelated to reproduction. In
contrast, few apps were designed for women to rank their sexual performance. However nearly all
reproduction apps were targeted at women, centred on their health and fertility [7]. Another of my
current studies that focuses on pregnancy apps identifies the focus on self-responsibilisation via
self-monitoring of one’s own body and that of the unborn that is evident in the apps’ focus. These

140
apps seek to enrol pregnant women by highlighting the ways in which close self-monitoring of
their pregnant bodies may avoid posing risks to their unborn as part of a broader ethos of
reproductive citizenship that involves many other forms of information and digital devices.
Pregnancy apps, however, offer even greater opportunities for women to engage in obsessive
self-surveillance because of their capacity to produce detailed data continuously in real-time
(including using sensors to monitor the pregnant and unborn bodies, such as maternal and foetal
heart-rate) and the function many offer of sharing these data with others on social media networks.
Here again gendered norms as well as expectations about “good motherhood” are reproduced in
such apps (see also [60]).
5. Case Study: Top-Ranked Health and Medical Apps in the Apple App Store
To provide a further example of how social researchers might approach the critical analysis of
apps as sociocultural artefacts, I present some analysis of the first 10 health and medical apps that
were listed in the charts of most popular apps as they were published on the Apple App Store on a
day in September 2014. This involved a total of 40 apps, including both the paid and free apps for
both categories, as these are separate lists. The App Store was chosen for this purpose because it is
one of the two major providers of apps (with Google Play) and because its daily top app charts
provide an easily accessible overview of the currently popular apps by content category. The Apple
App Store categorises apps into either the “Health & Fitness” or the “Medical Category” based on
the app developers’ nominations of which category their apps are designed for. The top charts are
reconfigured each day in response to users’ downloading habits. As such, the apps listed in this
analysis provide only a “snap-shot” of a particular moment in the top 10 (although some apps may
stay in the top 10 lists for several weeks or months if they are very popular).
I examine some of the aspects of app content that may be investigated, including topics,
approaches, appeals to authority, use of text and imagery and details provided about the developer.
App topics can suggest trends in health and medical regimes, treatments and conditions as well as
methods in medical education and training. The ways in which they verbally and visually represent
the human body provide insights into contemporary notions of embodiment, health and disease.
Examining the words used in the app titles and descriptions on the stores and the images used,
including the logo and screenshots employed to illustrate what the app offers potential users, is a
way of identifying the tacit assumptions that underpin them and their truth and authority claims.
Clicking through to the developers’ websites to examine their credentials and the statements that
they give about privacy of the data that may be uploaded to their platforms and the terms and
conditions of use provides another important source of information concerning the knowledge
economy of apps and the digital data that they may generate.
Table 1 provides a list of each app appearing on the top 10 for each of the top charts that
were examined.

As shown in the table, the top 10 paid apps in the health and fitness category in the Apple App
Store were those directed at working out (“7 Minute Workout”, “Body Trainer”), counting calories
(Easy Calorie Counter) and controlling body weight (“Weight N Watch—Daily Weight Tracker”),
reminding users not to sit for too long at a computer and to exercise their bodies and eyes
(“Healthier: Break Reminder”, “Eye Break” and “Break Reminder”), meditation and relaxation
(“Simply Being—Mediation for Relaxation & Presence”, “Brainwave Tuner”) and yoga (“All-in
Yoga”). The top 10 free health and fitness apps again focused on workouts (“Personal Workout”
and “Daily Ab Workout”), relaxation and better sleep (“Relax Melodies”, “Sleep Pillow”, “White
Noise Lite”, “Relax Melodies Seasons”, “Music Healing”), diet (“Paleo Diet Recipes”) and weight
loss (“FreeBMI” and “Lose Weight with Benjamin DeFoor”).
The list of the top 10 paid medical apps was dominated by human anatomy apps. Six of the top
10 paid apps included detailed anatomical atlases of the human body (“Essential Anatomy 4”,
“Muscle System Pro III”, “3D Human Body Organs Reference”, “Anatomy Quiz+”, “Pocket
Anatomy”, “Gray’s Anatomy Premium Edition”). It was evident from the wealth of detail provided
in these apps on human anatomy, including images of muscular and skeletal systems and the like,
as well as the titles and text of the app descriptions and developers’ websites, that these apps were
predominantly directed at healthcare practitioners and students rather than lay people. The
“iMedicalOffice”, an app for electronic health records software, was also designed for healthcare
practitioners and institutions, while the “Learning USMLE” was a training app for American
medical students seeking to take the medical licensing examination required for practising
medicine in that country. However the two remaining apps in the top 10 paid medical app category
were designed for patients to monitor and self-manage two chronic health conditions: diabetes
(“DiabetesPal”) and high blood pressure (“Blood Pressure Diary”). The “Diabetes Pal” app

142
encourages people with diabetes to record their detailed bodily data on the app software and these
data are automatically synced to the iCloud. The “Blood Pressure Diary” app also involves users
self-monitoring and uploading their bodily data to the app.
The top 10 free medical apps on the Apple App Store were also predominantly directed at
medical or healthcare professionals (seven of the 10). There were four human anatomy apps similar
to those appearing in the paid medical app chart. Two of the top 10 medical apps were related to
medical images. One was for viewing images such as MRIs and CT/CAT scans (“MRIcro
Viewer”) and the other was designed as a tutor for medical education in brain MRI and
neuroanatomy (“iSurf Brainview Desktop”). The list also included the “MBBS Year II by
WAGmob” app that the app description nominates as helping second year medical students
understand the basics of pharmacology, pharmacy, medicinal chemistry, pathology, genetics and
genetic engineering using such techniques as tutorials, quizzes and flashcards. For a more
general audience, the chart included a breathing control and relaxation app (“Breathing Zone
Free—Relaxing Breathing Exercises”) and another app for relaxation featuring self-hypnosis
(“Relax with Benjamin DeFoor—Sleep & Hypnosis”), as well as an app (in Spanish) designed as a
support for patients who were contemplating or had undergone plastic surgery (“PlasticSurgery”).
A constellation of interesting social, cultural and political elements may be discerned from this
sample of health and medical apps. These include digital bio-objects; healthism and individualism;
claims to authority and commercial interests; and data privacy and security. These are further
discussed below.
5.1. Digital Bio-Objects
Many of the apps described above engage in visual representations and other forms of providing
information on the human body. In the case of the human anatomy and body scan reading apps
designed for medical practitioners and students, these representations are highly detailed,
producing in-depth digitised atlases of the body that render the body transparent to the gaze by
peering at what lies beneath the skin. Self-monitoring apps designed for the use of lay people as
part of preventive health or the management of chronic conditions participate in a different form of
gaze. As was evident in the apps directed at patients engaging in self-care for diabetes and high
blood pressure, many apps encourage users to monitor their bodies closely, generating data on
many bodily functions.
Webster [54] uses the term “bio-objects” to describe the assemblages created by new biotechnologies.
We might productively view the assemblage that is configured via the interactions of human bodies
and apps as a digital bio-object, as are the digital data that this assemblage produces. These digital
data assemblages, which have also been referred to as “data doubles” [8,61,62], comprise new
forms of patienthood and embodiment when configured via apps. They make visible dimensions of
the body that previously were hidden, and expose them to often vast audiences by generating
digital quantifiable data about bodily functions and behaviours [8].
Not only, therefore, are traditional forms of representation of the human body used in health and
medical apps (such as the anatomical images that feature in the medical apps) but also new forms
of digitised embodiment, as are generated using self-monitoring health and medical apps. Unlike

143
the static images of the body used in the human anatomy apps, the data doubles that are thus
produced by individuals using these apps are constantly changing assemblages as new data are fed
into them. These data doubles are representations of the user’s own body created by use of the app.
The information that they configure on the user serves to shape future actions, thus creating a
cybernetic relationship between data double and user [8,9,62]. These data have a liveliness and
vitality, a social life of their own [50,63,64] that is facilitated by the app.
5.2. Healthism and Individualism
Technologies such as health and medical apps represent the vagaries of human embodiment as
amenable to control if sufficient vigilance and self-responsibility are exercised. When behaviours
and body functions are digitised as quantifiable data, indicators and concepts of health and fitness
become narrow representations of these phenomena. Health and wellbeing become represented by
certain numbers that are collected by one’s self-tracking device, game app or sensor-embedded
smart object [3,7–9,59,62].
The health and fitness concerns addressed by these apps demonstrate that efforts to train one’s
body, lose weight, avoid sitting for too long but also accomplishing work productivity and achieve
relaxation and better sleep are important for many of those who download both paid and free apps.
Returning to the top 10 paid health and fitness apps, for example, the “Healthier: Break Reminder”
app has the tagline “Work Healthier, rest smartly”. The description notes that “Research has shown
that prolonged sitting in front of a computer not only damages health, but also decreases
productivity. Healthier helps you to tackle both.” The app description ends with the call to “Start
getting healthier today!” The logo features a silver shield with a stylised red love heart shape inside
it, suggesting that the app will protect heart health. The description of the app notes that it
periodically reminds the user to take a break from their computer as well as providing
“HealthierTips” involving “office-suitable exercises for both eyes and body” in which users can
engage when taking a break from sitting at the computer. This app, therefore, supports the notion of
the healthy worker as productive worker.
Apps that are directed at influencing health-related behaviours and encouraging patient self-care
and voluntary promotion of one’s own health may be viewed as contributing to a neoliberal
political orientation in which “healthism”, or the privileging of health above other priorities [65,66]
and taking responsibility for one’s own health [8,9,67] are idealised. Such perspectives on health
and illness states routinely fail to acknowledge the social determinants of health in their focus on
individuals and their management of their health. Digital technologies such as health and medical
apps tend to support these individualistic approaches [3,5,7–9,12,59,62]. While some apps may
feature the opportunity to people to engage with a community of like-minded individuals who are
attempting to achieve the same ends, very few are directed at broader social change or activist
politics in the spirit of the new public health [3,4].
Furthermore, the taking up of self-tracking health apps and devices in an ever-growing variety
of social domains has led to people being “pushed” or coerced into using such technologies in the
interests of other actors and agencies. Health and life insurers are beginning to encourage their
customers to use self-tracking devices and apps to collect personal health and fitness data and

144
upload these date to their platforms in the interests of gaining “rewards” or being offered lower
premiums. Such uses of apps and the personal data they generate raise pressing questions about
potential social and economic discrimination against people who do not wish to participate in these
activities or those who are identified as not meeting targets for appropriate body weight, good
health or physical activity levels [64]. Algorithmic calculations using personal health data may lead
to predictive privacy harms [68], where individuals are singled out as being “at risk” from ill health
and therefore forced to pay higher insurance premiums or may be refused insurance, credit or
employment [69].
5.3. Claims to Authority and Commercial Interests
The types of authority that are presented in health and medical apps and their roles as agents in
the knowledge economy also require attention. As several writers in the medical and public health
literature reviewed above have pointed out, many app descriptions or developer websites fail to
acknowledge how the specialised health or medical information that are presented in the apps are
generated. The apps assume an authority on health and medical matters that are not always
supported by any provided material as evidence of how the content was derived, whether it is
regularly updated and so on.
This lack of information was evident in most of the apps I analysed above. The developer of the
top-ranked paid medical app, “Essential Anatomy 4”, for example, is the 3D4Medical technology
company. On its website the company notes that it “specializes in the development of medical,
education and health & fitness apps for professional reference as well as student and patient
education”. It is also claimed on the website that the company has achieved over 10 million app
downloads worldwide, and is clearly successful in marketing its apps. However the company does
not provide much detail about how its medical information is derived, noting only that its apps
“have all been medically approved and designed to the highest standard”. The developer of the app
directed at educating second year medical students, WAGMobile, is a generalist app development
company that provide apps for clients in numerous categories. It does not provide any details of
how the content is generated, and indeed offers a disclaimer at the bottom of the app description
that notes “Please do not take any action based on the content of this app”; an odd caution given
that the material is marketed at accomplishing training for medical students.
Apps contribute to a political environment in which the Internet empires are increasingly
exerting a variety of “soft power” in their dominance of the digital knowledge economy [50,70,71].
In the age of big data, the data that are generated by apps are becoming increasingly
commercialised. As part of engaging in these acts of prosumption, users’ personal data are
exploited and transformed into commercial profit by other actors and agencies [10,72]. The data
produced from self-tracking apps and devices, patient support and opinion websites and those
scraped from social media sites where medical and health topics are discussed, for example,
possess great value to pharmaceutical, healthcare and biotechnical companies as well as
government agencies and public health enterprises [10]. However it is not always apparent where
vested interests lie in the provision of medical information in apps either for lay people or members
of the medical profession [10,46,73]. At present there is no way of fully identifying the role that

145
pharmaceutical companies or medical device developers may have played in contributing to the
content of apps.
5.4. Data Privacy and Security
The lack of information that is provided in many app descriptions or on the developers’ websites
means that there is often very little transparency about how users’ personal information is used
by the developer or other parties to which these data may be sold. This was evident in the
self-monitoring of chronic diseases apps that featured in the top 10 paid medical app list. The
company that the “Diabetes Pal” app, Lobotomo Software, provides no information on the app
description or its website on their privacy policy or terms and conditions of use of the app, despite
the fact that the app is collecting several aspects of personal health data and storing these data on a
cloud storage platform. This is also the case for the “Blood Pressure Diary” app.
In the wake of the Snowden revelations about the use of app data and other personal digital data
use in national security surveillance operations, more attention has been paid to data security and
privacy on digital platforms and devices. The extent to which the personal health and medical data
information that is collected by apps are used commercially and on-sold to third parties is
becoming revealed [74–76]. Several reports recently published by privacy organisations have noted
the lack of details offered by many medical and health app developers of what they do with users’
personal data [73]. The Global Privacy Enforcement Network in a sweep of over 1000 apps found
that 60 per cent raised privacy concerns. Many failed to properly inform users how their personal
data were being used or made excessive demands for personal data from users [77].
It appears that developers are beginning to take note of consumers’ growing concerns about data
privacy and security. A market research report of a survey of more than 2000 health and medical
app developers found that data security and standards issues were viewed as barriers to further
development of this app market [14]. It is notable that in its latest health and medical-related
technologies Apple is taking steps to protect users’ privacy by outlining how technology
developers may use their HealthKit framework in their App Store guidelines. These note that users
are given control over their data by explicitly granting each app permission to read and write data
to the HealthKit store. The HealthKit data cannot be saved to iCloud or synced across multiple
devices and are kept only on the user’s device. App developers are not permitted to use information
gained from their apps for targeting users with advertising or similar services or disclose users’
data to a third party without express permission from the user. Even if permission is granted, the
app developers cannot share information with a third party unless they are also providing a health
and fitness service to the user, and app developers cannot sell users’ data to third parties. App
developers are required to state clearly how they will use their personal data and provide a privacy
policy. Apps that provide diagnoses, treatment advice or control hardware designed to diagnose or
treat medical conditions that do not provide evidence of regulatory approval will be rejected [78].

146
6. Conclusions
In this article I have begun to outline an agenda for understanding and analysing health and
medical apps as sociocultural artefacts that are actors in heterogeneous networks of other actors,
both human and nonhuman. By presenting a case study of how a critical social analysis of health
and medical apps may be undertaken, the kinds of features evident in such technologies’
representations on app stores have been identified. Such a brief analysis, however, can only go so
far in fully illustrating the symbolic and social nature of health and medical apps. I have only
touched on a tiny proportion of the vast array of topics and practices that health and medical
apps cover.
Much more research is required from a critical perspective on these technologies. Few in depth
studies have as yet been conducted into the ways in which lay people engage with health and
medical apps, including non-users or those who take up some apps but then relinquish them
shortly afterwards. We know very few details about how health professionals such as medical
practitioners, hospital administrators, public health professionals and health promoters are
incorporating apps and associated mobile digital technologies into their work practices. Little
knowledge is available on the practices and tacit assumptions of app developers and designers and
the companies that commission apps. Nor do we know how lay people and healthcare and public
health workers might be resisting or subverting these devices or creating their own. Analysis of the
circulations, transformations and repurposing of the digital data that are generated by apps requires
further attention, as do the topics of personal data security and privacy as the domains in which
personal health and medical data are collected and used expand. Detailed social research that is able
to elucidate the situated knowledges, meanings and uses of apps offers immense potential for social
researchers who are interested in health and medicine and in digital technologies.
