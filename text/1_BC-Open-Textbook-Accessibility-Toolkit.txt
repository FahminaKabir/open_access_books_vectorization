About the Toolkit

The Accessibility Toolkit is a collaboration between BCcampus and the Centre for Accessible Post-secondary
Education Resources BC (CAPER-BC). BCcampus is a publicly funded organization that uses information
technology to connect the expertise, programs, and resources of all B.C. post-secondary institutions under a
collaborative service delivery framework. BCcampus is the lead organization for the open textbook project in
BC. CAPER-BC provides accessible learning and teaching materials to students and instructors who cannot use
conventional print because of disabilities.
The Accessibility Toolkit has also been translated into French. http://opentextbc.ca/troussedoutildaccessibilite/

About the British Columbia Open Textbook Project
The Accessibility Toolkit was created as part of the B.C. Open Textbook Project. The B.C. Open Textbook Project
began in 2012 with the goal of making post-secondary education in British Columbia more accessible by reducing
student cost through the use of openly licensed textbooks. The BC Open Textbook Project is administered by
BCcampus and funded by the British Columbia Ministry of Advanced Education.
Open textbooks are open educational resources (OER); they are instructional resources created and shared in
ways so that more people have access to them. This is a different model than traditionally copyrighted materials.
OER are defined as teaching, learning, and research resources that reside in the public domain or have been
released under an intellectual property license that permits their free use and re-purposing by others (Hewlett
Foundation). Our open textbooks are openly licensed using a Creative Commons license, and are offered in
various e-book formats free of charge, or as printed books that are available at cost. For more information
about this project, please contact opentext@bccampus.ca. If you are an instructor who is using this book for a
course, please let us know.

What Is an Open Textbook?
Open textbooks are open educational resources (OERs), which are instructional resources created and shared
using open licences. This means that they are free for others to use, copy, distribute, modify, or reuse. Open
textbooks can be a useful pedagogical tool, as their content may be modified and customized to meet specific
learning objectives of a particular course.

ABOUT THE TOOLKIT • vii

Why an Accessibility Toolkit?
The focus of many open textbook projects is to provide access to education at low or no cost. But what does
access mean? If the materials are not accessible for each and every student, do they fulfill the mandate to deliver
fully open textbooks?
The goal of the Accessibility Toolkit is to provide the needed resources needed to each content creator,
instructional designer, educational technologist, librarian, administrator, and teaching assistant to create a truly
open and accessible textbook — one that is free and accessible for all students.
As you work through the content of the Accessibility Toolkit, you will find that the suggestions provided are
intended for the non-technical user. If you are looking for more technical descriptions of how to make your work
accessible, we suggest you review the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).

To Care & Comply: Accessibility of Online Course Content
A look at Portland Community College’s web accessibility guidelines and how supporting students with
disabilities is a shared responsibility across the college. Video includes stories from students whose education is
impacted by inaccessible web content and ways faculty and staff can improve online course materials to make
course content more accessible. This is an OER (Open Educational Resourse).

Key Concepts

1

Universal Design

Universal Design is the process of creating products (devices, environments, systems, and processes) that are
usable by people with the widest possible range of abilities, operating within the widest possible range of
situations (environments, conditions, and circumstances). Universal Design emerged from the slightly earlier
concept of being barrier-free, the broader accessibility movement, and adaptive and assistive technology. It also
seeks to blend aesthetics into these core considerations.
Let’s review some common definitions of Universal Design.

Definition 1:
Universal Design or Universal Instructional Design (UID)
is an approach to teaching that consists of the proactive design and use of inclusive instructional and evaluation
strategies. This approach provides academic access to a broad range of learners, including students with
disabilities, while:
• maintaining academic standards […]
• reducing the need to having to retrofit after a course is already underway

1

Definition 2:
Universal Instructional Design (UID)
is an approach to designing course instruction, materials and content to benefit people of all learning styles without
adaptation or retrofitting. UID provides equal access to learning, not simply equal access to information. UID
allows the student to control the method of accessing information while the instructor monitors the learning process
and initiates any beneficial methods. …It should be noted that UID does not remove academic challenges; it
2
removes barriers to access.

UNIVERSAL DESIGN • 3

Why Universal Design?
For our purposes, we frame the practice of using Universal Design in a holistic and manageable way, and begin by
addressing the barriers that are easy to anticipate and proactively re-mediate. This toolkit, therefore, will provide
guidance to you if the answers to any of the following questions is “yes”:
• Do I have visual materials that present core concepts that not all students may be able to see or understand?
• Do I have multimedia (audio, video) materials that present core concepts that not all students may be able to
be hear, see, or access?
• Do I have documents that present core concepts in a format that not all students may be able to access?
For the purpose of the Accessibility Toolkit, we focus on an adjunct to Universal Design, that being Universal
Design for Learning (UDL), which is a set of principles for curriculum development that gives all individuals
equal opportunities to learn. UDL provides a blueprint for creating instructional goals, methods, materials, and
assessments that work for everyone. Rather than a single, one-size-fits-all solution, it offers a flexible approach
3
that can be customized and adjusted for individual needs.

Using Personas

Using Personas
Designers use personas to represent the different types of people who may be accessing a website or product.
In this toolkit, we have used personas to help you keep in mind the various types students and their various
abilities while you’re developing content. We’ve also used these personas to introduce you to different types of
hardware and software that students typically use.
We’ve adapted the personas from Sarah Horton and Whitney Queensbury’s book A Web for Everyone: Designing
Accessible User Experience to be more specific to postsecondary students with print disabilities in British
Columbia (based on data from CAPER-BC and the students who attended our focus group).
These are some of the students who will be reading the open textbooks that you write.

Best Practices

Organizing Content

Organizing content so it has a logical flow just makes sense. Using chapters, headings, and subheadings to
organize content allows students to clearly see how the main concepts are related. Headings are one of the main
ways that students using a screen reader navigate through a chapter.

Who Are You Doing This For?
Everyone benefits from having content that’s clearly organized. In addition, well-organized content supports
students who:
• Have a learning disability, for example like Ann
• Are blind or have low vision, for example like Jacob

Ann: “This allows me to go back and easily find the important points.”

rosenfeldmedia.com/books/a-web-for-everyone/

Jacob: “This gives me more control in navigating through the chapter. I can skip to the relevant section, instead of
having to read the whole thing in a liner fashion.”

What Do You Need to Do?
Headings help to identify the hierarchical structure of a document (e.g., sections, sub-sections). Headings provide
a visual cue that helps sighted readers quickly navigate through sections of a document, skimming through content
until they find a section they are looking for. Similarly, headings create logical divisions in the content and allow
a non-sighted user to navigate a page or document easily using a screen reader.
When it comes to using visual references to indicate the hierarchy and structure of a document, you may be
accustomed to just changing the font, enlarging the type size, making it bold or underlined or italicized, creating
the impression of a heading. This approach presents problems when creating material with accessibility in mind
because screen readers won’t identify the text as a heading. Instead, a screen reader will just “read” through the
text of a heading as if it were part of another paragraph of content, missing your intended cues about structure
and organization.

ORGANIZING CONTENT • 15

To create effective, accessible headings: In Pressbooks use styles in the visual editor to tag sections with
Heading 1, sub-sections with Heading 2, and sub-sections of sub-sections with Heading 3.

Heading examples from Pressbooks Visual

Images

In this section, we provide recommendations to guide your inclusion of accessible, image-based content.

What Are Images?
Images include: photographs, diagrams, pictures, charts, graphs, maps
File types: .gif, .jpg, .png

Before You Begin
Why Are You Including the Images You Have Selected?
Before you can determine what you need to do to make an image accessible, you first need to identify its purpose
or value to your textbook. Consider the following questions:
1. Does your image serve a functional purpose? In other words, is it conveying non-text content to students? If
so, you should:
• Provide a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose of the non-text material
• Not use colour as the only visual means of conveying information

1

2

2. Does your image serve more of a decorative purpose? In other words, is it primarily a design element that does
not convey content? If so, you should:
• Avoid unnecessary text descriptions

What Do You Need To Do?
Functional Images and Alternative Text Descriptions
Consider what your content page would look like if the images didn’t load. Now try writing alternative text for
each image that would work as a replacement and provide the same service as the image.
As you work on developing your alternative text descriptions, keep the following recommendations and
guidelines in mind:
• Remember that alternative text must convey the content and functionality of an image and is rarely a
literal description of the image (e.g., “photo of cat”). Rather than providing what the image looks like,
3
alternative text should convey what the content of the image is and what it does.

3. WebAIM (2014). Alt text blunders. Accessed from: http://webaim.org/articles/gonewild/#alttext

18 • BC OPEN TEXTBOOK ACCESSIBILITY TOOLKIT

• For relatively simple images (e.g., photographs, illustrations), try to keep your text descriptions short. You
should aim to create a brief alternative (one or two short sentences) that is an accurate and concise
equivalent to the information in the image.

• For more complex images (e.g., detailed charts, graphs, maps), you will need to provide more than a one- to
two-sentence description to ensure all users will benefit from the content or context you intended to
provide. In these cases, you should either provide the details in the text surrounding the image or write a
longer text description that students can link to on a separate page. You should still include a short text
description (one to two sentences) that tells students where they can find the details you have provided in
the longer description.

• Leave out any unnecessary information. For example, you do not need to include information like “image
of…” or “photo of…”; assistive technologies will automatically identify the material as an image, so
including that detail in your alternative description is superfluous.

• Avoid redundancy of content in your alternative description. Don’t repeat the same information that already
appears in text adjacent to the image.
Here are two examples of alternative text descriptions.
Example 1 (from Introduction to Sociology):

IMAGES • 19

Morro do Prazères in Rio de Janeiro and the London
financial district show two sides of global urbanization

This photograph could be described in this way:
Figure 20.11 includes two photos. The first photo shows crowded buildings located on the hillside. They are
small and shabby. The second photo shows magnificent buildings located by water.

Example 2 (Figure 18.1. Two-Atom, Double-Flask Diagram from Introductory Chemistry):

When the stopcock is opened between the flasks, the two atoms can distribute in four possible ways.

20 • BC OPEN TEXTBOOK ACCESSIBILITY TOOLKIT

Figure 18.1 could be described as follows:
Figure 18.1 shows a diagram with five pairs of circles. All of these circles are open. The left one opens on
the right and the right one opens on the left. They are connected with lines at their open points. One pair is
located on the left and between their two connecting lines is a black dot with a red vertical line going across.
The other four pairs arranged in a column are located on the right and between the connecting lines of each pair
is a a small circle with a red horizontal line going through. A right arrow labelled Open Stopcock links the pair
sitting on the left to the four pairs on the right. Each of these five pairs has two dots (green and blue) arranged
in different patterns. For the pair on the left, the two dots, sitting obliquely, appear only in left circle. The green
dot is at the left upper part of the circle and following it the blue dot is close to the bottom right. The first pair
on the right has the similar situation. The only difference is that the green dot is at the right upper part of the
circle and the blue dot is close the middle left. The second pair has a green dot in the centre of the left circle
and a blue dot in the centre of the right circle. The third pair has a blue dot sitting at the left upper part of the
left circle and a green dot sitting close to bottom right of the right circle. For the last pair, the two dots appear
in oblique direction only in the right circle. A green dot is at the right upper part of the circle and a blue dot is
close to bottom left.

Using Colour
Consider what your images would look like if they only displayed in black and white. Would any necessary
context or content be lost if the colour was “turned off”? Images should not rely on colour to convey information;
if the point you are making depends on colour to be understood, you may need to edit your image or formatting so
that concepts presented are not lost to those who are colour blind or who require high contrast between colours.

In this example of a bar chart, colour is the sole means of
communicating the data.

Example 1 — not accessible:
In this basic bar chart, colour is the only means by which information is conveyed.

IMAGES • 21

This view of the same bar chart displays how the chart might
appear to a student who is colour blind, or whose device does not
display colour. All of the meaningful data is lost.

Example 2 — not accessible:
For a student who is colour blind or who has poor contrast vision, all of the relevant information is lost in a colour
chart.

Example 3 — accessible:
Students who are colour blind can distinguish between high-contrast shades. In this example, contextual labels
have been added to each bar at the bottom of the chart. Note that the chart will still require an alternative text
description.

22 • BC OPEN TEXTBOOK ACCESSIBILITY TOOLKIT

In this view of the bar chart, high-contrast colours have been used
so that shading differences will still display in grey scale. Text
labels have also been added so that the data is not just being
communicated with colour.

Decorative Images
If your image does not add meaning and is included for decorative or design purposes only, the space for the
alternative text description should still be included with your image, but it should be left empty or blank. Assistive
technologies will detect the image, and by leaving the alternative text description blank, you will signal to the
student that there isn’t any contextual content embedded. Including alternative text descriptions for decorative
images “simply slows the process down with no benefit because the screen-reading software vocalizes the content
4
of the [alternative text description], whether that alternative text adds value or not.”

Tables

In this section, we provide guidelines and recommendations for formatting tables.

What Are Tables?
Tables: In this context, we are referring to data tables, which are tables that include row and/or column header
information to categorize content)
File types: .doc, .html, .pdf

Before You Begin
Are Your Tables Simple or Complex?
A simple table includes a maximum of one header column and/or one header row. A complex table includes more
1
than one header column and/or header row, and may include merged or split cells.
We recommend you make every effort to keep data tables as simple in structure as possible. The more complex
the design of a data table, the less accessible it will be for some students using screen-reading technology to access
their textbook materials. Screen readers move left-to-right, top-to-bottom, one cell at a time, and because a screen
reader does not repeat a cell, merging or splitting cells may affect the reading order of a table.

Who Are You Doing This For?
This work supports students who:
• Are blind or have low vision, for example Jacob
• Have a form of cognitive disability, for example Ann

24 • BC OPEN TEXTBOOK ACCESSIBILITY TOOLKIT

What Do You Need To Do?
In the same way that your content hierarchy needs true headings and structure, tables need a properly defined
structure to be accessible. This means that you must add row and column headers to define the different sections
of data. Screen readers read tables horizontally – cell by cell, row by row – and row and column headers help give
the context of the data in each cell to students who are blind, have low vision, or have a cognitive disability.

Creating Simple Tables
A simple table includes:
1. A table title or caption
2. Maximum of one row of column headers and/or maximum of one column of row headers
3. No merged or split cells
4. Adequate cell padding for visual learners.
Example:
The table below is a simple table. Reviewed against the preceding requirements list, this table:
1. Includes a title (Spring Blossoms)
2. Has one row in which cells are tagged as column headers (Colour Family, Bulbs, Shrubs, Trees), and one

TABLES • 25

column (beginning on the second row) in which the cells are tagged as row headers (Pink, Yellow)
3. Contains no merged or split cells
4. Has adequate cell padding to provide space buffering around the data in each cell. (Cell padding in this
table is set at “10”).
Spring Blossoms
Colour Family

Bulbs

Shrubs

Trees

Pink

Tulips

Flowering currant

Ornamental plum

Yellow

Daffodils

Forsythia

Star magnolia

For a student accessing the table through a screen reader, the first row of data will be presented along the lines of:
• Pink, Bulbs: Tulips
• Pink, Shrubs: Flowering currant
• Pink, Trees: Ornamental plum

Weblinks

In this section, we review how to add accessible weblinks to content.

What Are Weblinks?
Weblink: a link from a file or document to another location (such as a website address) or file, typically activated
by clicking on a highlighted word or image on the screen.
File types: .html, .pdf, .doc, .xls

Before You Begin
Why Are You Including the Weblinks You Have Selected?
Generally weblinks are included within content to provide the user with additional information that is available at
a another location.

Who Are You Doing This For?
This work supports students who:
• Have a form of cognitive disablity, for example Ann
• Have a physical disability, for example Trish
• Are deaf or hard of hearing
• Are blind or have low vision

What Do You Need To Do?
Descriptions
Ensure that all web pages and weblinks have titles that describe a topic or purpose.
The purpose of the link can be determined by the text alone. That is, you don’t need to include additional
information justifying the use of the link. You want the link to be meaningful in context. For example, do not use
generic text such as “click here” or “read more” unless the purpose of the link can be determined by meaning in
1
the surrounding content.
Consider the following examples.
Example 1 — unclear:
• Click here for information on the BC Open Textbook Project.
Example 12 — clear and accessible:
• Information on the BC Open Textbook Project is available online.

28 • BC OPEN TEXTBOOK ACCESSIBILITY TOOLKIT

New Tabs/Windows
In general, it is better if weblinks do not open new windows and tabs since they can be disorienting for people,
2
especially people who have difficulty perceiving visual content.
However, if a link must open in a new window, it is best practice to include a textual reference. For example,
3
Information on the BC Open Textbook Project [New Window] is available online.

Multimedia

In this section, we provide recommendations to guide your inclusion of accessible multimedia content.

What Is Multimedia?
Multimedia includes: videos, audio, animations, slideshows
File types: .mp3, .mp4, ppt., etc.

Before You Begin
What Type of Multimedia Are You Including?
Before you can determine what you need to do to make media materials accessible, you need to understand what
is required for different types of multimedia. Consider the following questions:
1. Does your multimedia resource include audio narration or instruction? If so, you should:
• Provide a complete transcript of all speech content and relevant non-speech content in the resource.
2. Does your multimedia resource include audio that is synchronized with a video presentation? If so, you
should:
• Provide captions of all speech content and relevant non-speech content in the resource.
3. Does your multimedia resource include contextual visuals (e.g., charts, graphs) that are not addressed in the
spoken content? If so, you should:
• Provide audio descriptions of relevant visual materials in the resource.

Who Are You Doing This For?
This work supports students who:

29

30 • BC OPEN TEXTBOOK ACCESSIBILITY TOOLKIT

• Are deaf or hard of hearing, for example Steven.
• Are blind or have low vision, for example Jacob
• Have a form of cognitive disability
• Are in a location where they cannot play or hear audio
• Are not native-English speakers and need written-word formats to support understanding

MULTI-MEDIA • 31

What Do You Need To Do?
Transcripts
Consider what your students would get out of your multimedia resource if they were not able to hear the audio
portion, or if they had difficulty understanding your spoken word. A text transcript provides students with
1
equivalent information to the audio content in a multimedia resource.
As you work on developing your text transcript, keep in mind the following recommendations about what to
include:
1. Speaker’s name
2. All speech content: If there is speech that is not relevant, it is usually best to indicate that it has been
excluded from the transcript. For example: “[A & B chatted while slides were loading].”
3. Relevant descriptions about the speech: Descriptions that convey emotions, mood, etc. are usually
provided in brackets. For example: “Don’t touch that! [shouted].”
4. Descriptions of relevant non-speech audio: These are usually provided in brackets. For example: “[metal
pipes crashing to concrete floor].” Background noise that isn’t relevant can be left out.
5. Headings and sub-headings: Where they will make the transcript more usable or easy to navigate,
headings and sub-headings can be helpful aids, especially when the transcript is long. When including
these, put them in brackets to show that they were not part of the original audio. For example:
[Introduction]; [Group Discussion]; [Case Study].

Transcripts and third-party videos
If you are not producing your own video resource but are planning to embed video materials from a thirdparty source (e.g., YouTube), be aware that not all third-party sources include transcripts. While services
like YouTube technically support transcripts, not all contributors to YouTube include these. If you select a
video resource that does not already have a transcript, you will need to produce one yourself.*
*Copyright note: Producing your own transcript for a third-party video could infringe on copyright,
depending on how the video has been licensed. Before you proceed with producing a transcript for media
materials you did not create yourself, you should contact the copyright holder of that material to obtain
permission to do so.

Captions
Captions are the text that is synchronized with the audio in a video presentation. Captions are important when
people need to see what’s happening in the video and get the audio information in text at the same time.
The work you put into creating a text transcript for a video resource can be repurposed to provide the captions.
Keep in mind the following recommendations about what to include in your captions:
1. All speech content: If there is speech that is not relevant, it is usually best to indicate that it has been
excluded from the captions. For example: “[A & B chatted while slides were loading].”
2. Descriptions of relevant non-speech audio: These are usually provided in brackets. For example: “[metal
pipes crashing to concrete floor]”; “[background music by XXX plays].” Background noise that isn’t
relevant can be left out.

Audio Descriptions
Consider what your students would get out of a multimedia resource if they were not able to see embedded visual
materials critical for comprehension. Audio descriptions are helpful if visual content (e.g., a chart or a map) in a
2
video or presentation provides important context that is not available through the audio alone.
When describing visual elements in your multimedia resources, keep in mind the following recommendations and
guidelines.
1. When contextual visual content on the screen is not described in the audio itself, you will need to provide an
audio description that is an objective description of the visual element.
Example:
To help students fully grasp a concept that you are trying to convey in your video, you have included some
contextual visual references (e.g., maps, charts, physical demonstrations of a process). However, you realize after
making the video that the audio portion does not describe these visuals in enough detail for a student like Jacob to
be able to access all of the concepts you intended to convey.
In this case, you would need to record an audio description of the visual material that provides enough detail to
provide students like Jacob with the same content available to visual learners.
2. Whenever possible, avoid creating the need for audio descriptions in the first place by being proactive at the
time of recording. If you pay attention to contextual visuals during the recording of the media piece, you may find
opportunities to convey the visual content within the spoken material itself; you will not need to provide audio
descriptions of the visual content after the fact.
Example:
You are recording a video or presentation that includes a chart that tracks coal production in British Columbia,

MULTI-MEDIA • 33

and as part of the presentation you want to focus attention on specific data in the chart. The narrator or presenter
might point to sections on the chart and say:
“As you can see, metallurgical coal projection increased by 3 million tonnes over these two years.“

In this case, audio descriptions would be necessary to provide the missing context to students with visual
disabilities; these students cannot see the data on the chart that tells visual learners what the production figures are
and for what dates. However, if the narrator or presenter instead says:
“This chart illustrates that metallurgical coal production in B.C. increased from 23 million tonnes in 1999 to 26
million tonnes in 2001,”

the visual content is conveyed through the audio and no audio description will be necessary.

Formulas

In this section, we review how to add accessible formulas to the content.

What Are Formulas?
Formulas include: Math equations or science formulas
File types: LaTex or MathType

Before You Begin
Who Are You Doing This For?
This work supports students who:
• Are blind or have low vision
• Have a form of cognitive disability, for example Mark
• Have a physical disability

The following content is a derivative of Equations: Images vs. MathML from Accessibility and Usability at Penn
State, http://accessibility.psu.edu/equations.

What Do You Need To Do?
There are several ways to handle equations from images with ALT tags to MathML. Having access to an equation
editor such as MathType or MathMagic can streamline processing and converting equations considerably. These
tools are similar to equation editors found in the ANGEL HTML Editor and Microsoft Office.

MathML
Math ML is a text-based XML markup language designed for math equations. Browsers that support MathML
are able to translate the XML into a formatted equation. Since MathML with MathJax can be rendered in
many systems, including HTML, Sites at Penn State, ANGEL and Drupal, it is considered the best choice for
accessibility.
Information about creating and viewing MathML is available on that page.
MathML may vary from system to system and the content can change rapidly.

Image with ALT tag
A safe option to create an image of an equation (or export it from an equation editor) and then insert the image
into a document with an ALT tag.

36 • BC OPEN TEXTBOOK ACCESSIBILITY TOOLKIT

Note: ALT tags can be written in Nemeth MathSpeak for students who have learned that system.
Example 1– an equation in HTML:

View the ALT Tag
ALT= “m equals begin fraction m sub 0 over begin square root 1 minus begin fraction v sup 2 over c sup 2 end
fraction end square root end fraction”

LaTeX
LaTeX is a math markup language familiar to many in the science and math community, but unfortunately it is
not currently supported by screen reader technology. However, it is fairly simple to convert LaTeX to an image or
MathML in most equation editors.
To import LaTeX, follow these steps in MathMagic and MathType:
1. Copy a piece of LaTeX code such as
m &= \frac{m_0}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
into an equation editor’s main editing window.
2. The equation should appear fully formated. Make minor adjustments as needed.

At our BCcampus user testing, students indicated that it would helpful to have an audio file of the formula or
equation. The audio file would be placed beside the formula or equation and would allow the user to hear exactly
how the formula or equation is interpreted.
Example — equation with audio:

Font size

In this section, we review the two main concerns of font size on the web.

What Is Font Size?
Font size: The size of text visible on the screen.

Before You Begin
Who Are You Doing This For?
This work supports students who:
• Are blind or have low vision, for example Diana
• Have a form of cognitive disability
• Are deaf or hard of hearing
• Have a physical disability

38

FONT SIZE • 39

Profile of Diana, original artwork by BCcampus.

What Do You Need To Do?
There are two main concerns when working with font sizes.
1. Ensuring that default font sizes are not too small.
2. Ensuring that text can be expanded to 200% on websites.

1

Keep in mind these recommendations and guidelines:
• 12 point for body text: For most documents, body text should be around 12 points. Small fonts may be
illegible for some audiences.
• 9 point for footnotes: If a document contains footnotes or endnotes, the minimum size should be about 9
points
• 200% zoom: The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0) recommend ensuring that text can be
2
zoomed to 200%. As well, we recommend using liquid layouts that can accommodate 200% text.

1. http://sites.psu.edu/accessibility/fontsizehtml/
2. Liquid layout are layouts that are based on percentages of the current browser window's size. They flex with the size of the window, even if
the current viewer changes their browser size as they're viewing the site. Liquid width layouts allow a very efficient use of the space
provided by any given Web browser window or screen resolution.

Colour Contrast

In this section, we provide guidelines and recommendations about colour contrast in your textbook materials.

What Is Colour Contrast?
Colour contrast includes: hue, lightness and saturation of text, images, and background
File types: .doc, .html, .pdf, .jpg, .gif

Before You Begin
What Role Does Colour Play in the Delivery of Your Content?
When documents or web pages do not provide enough contrast between foreground elements (e.g., text, images)
and background elements (e.g., colour, watermark images), some students will have difficulty reading the content.
Consider the following questions:
1. Have you presented text- or image-based content on a coloured or textured background? If so, you should:
• Confirm that there is sufficient contrast between your foreground content and the chosen background colour
or texture.
2. Have you included links in your content? If so, you should:
• Confirm that the colour of your web links is distinct from both your background colour and the colour of
the surrounding text.
3. Have you used colour to convey concepts or information? If so, you should:
• Confirm that you are not using colour alone to convey this information.

Who Are You Doing This For?
This work supports students who:

COLOUR CONTRAST • 41

• Have low vision, like Diana
• Have poor contrast vision
• Are colour blind and cannot differentiate between certain colours
• Are using a device with monochrome display

Profile of Diana, original artwork by BCcampus

What Do You Need To Do?
Contrast
Students with low vision and/or a form of colour blindness may have difficulty reading text that does not contrast
enough with the background colour you have selected. If the colour palette you have adopted is too subtle (e.g.,
white text on a pastel background; medium-grey text on a light-grey background), the contrast between your
foreground and background is probably insufficient for some students.
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0) require that “the visual presentation of text and images of
1
text has a contrast ratio of at least 7:1.” The image below presents four different foreground/background colourcontrast examples to illustrate insufficient and sufficient colour contrast ratios.

UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast7.html

42 • BC OPEN TEXTBOOK ACCESSIBILITY TOOLKIT

Image displays four examples of foreground (text) colour against background colours; only the example on
the far right presents combinations with sufficient colour contrast.

Not sure how to test your materials for colour contrast ratios?
There are many online and downloadable tools available to help you evaluate colour contrast ratios. Here
are a few we have tried and like:
• WebAIM’s Color Contrast Checker: This web-based tool allows you to select or enter colour
values to test and provides you with a “pass” or “fail” on your contrast ratio.
• ACART’s Contrast Checker: This is a straightforward, web-based tool you can use to both check
colour contrast and view your selections in grey scale. This tool also allows you to keep a history of
the colour combinations you have tested.
• Giacomo Mazzocato’s Accessibility Color Wheel: This web-based tool includes several options
for testing your colour selections, including simulations of three types of colour blindness. You can
also opt to test what your contrast ratio is when the foreground and background colour selections are
inverted.

Weblink Colours
Weblinks must be visually distinct from both the surrounding, non-linked text and background colour. If you do
not underline your links (or provide some other non-colour cue), you must ensure that you provide both sufficient
contrast between the link and background colours and between the link colour and that of the surrounding text.
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0) require a:
• 4.5:1 contrast between the link text color and the background
• 3:1 contrast between the link text color and the surrounding non-link text color

COLOUR CONTRAST • 43

High-Contrast Mode
Some students need to see light text on a dark background for it to be readable, while others require dark text
on a light background. Students with low vision (like Diana) must be able to see content when it is displayed in
high-contrast mode. This can be a subjective experience, based on individual student needs. We recommend that
you try testing your text and image-based content as you go by using high-contrast mode on your own computer
and making adjustments as needed.
All content items such as text, images, bullets, and table borders must be visible in both regular and high-contrast
modes.

Not sure how to test your content in high-contrast mode?
To test the visibility of your content in this mode, turn on high contrast by simultaneously pressing the
following keys on your (PC) keyboard:
Left ALT + Left SHIFT + Print Screen.
To turn off high contrast mode, repeat this step.

Use of Colour*
You should not rely on colour as the sole means of conveying information and instruction. If the point you are
making depends on colour to be understood, you will need to edit your materials so that concepts presented in the
3
visuals are not lost to those who are colour blind or who require high contrast between colours.
*This topic is also addressed in the Images section of the Toolkit.

Appendix: Redesign or Accommodation Activity
Guidelines

About the Redesign or Accommodation Activity
We have grounded the “Redesign or Accommodation?” activity in the student-centeredness of Universal Design
for Learning (UDL) – a framework that recognizes that we cannot design learning experiences for a singular type
of student.
“Redesign or Accommodation?” also incorporates the humanizing-element of student “Personas”, some who you
will recognize from within the Accessibility Toolkit. Each participant adopts a Persona and advocates from that
student’s perspective when presented with a Scenario that is based on common or recurring components of course
delivery.
In facilitated discussions, participants identify any potential barriers that the Scenario presents for their Personaselves, consider what accommodations to address the barrier would look like—and if their Persona would even
qualify to receive one, and then determine if the barrier/s could be avoided entirely by applying a UDL-based
redesign to the course components in question.
We have created several Scenarios for this activity, but we also recommend you try running scenarios arising
from your own practice and within your own institution against your Persona-based selves; it may help you to
proactively identify and address barriers before they affect your students.
Attached are the assorted “Redesign or Accommodation?” activity materials.
Redesign or Accommodation Activity Guidelines
Redesign or Accommodation Scenarios
Redesign or Accommodation Persona Cards (Detailed)
Persona Cards for Printing
Thank you to the University of PEI for having developed and contributed 4 new Persona additions to the
“Redesign or Accommodation?” activity: Alex, Khaleed, Maridee and Natalie. These new additions were a
collaborative development between UPEI’s Accessibility Services and the E-Learning Office.
